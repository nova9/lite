<I>Hi everyone. This is my first submission to Literotica. I started out not really knowing why I was doing this; only that I thought I wanted to. Previously I'd started another story for Lit after having what I thought was a pretty cool plot come to me in the form of a dream. Anyway, I lost steam on that project, but the idea of how dreams connect with reality stayed with me. I started this about two months ago. Hopefully it's a decent combo of the two S's (story and sex). Be warned: it's long. 

Disclaimer: Placenames are real but mainly used only as points of reference, people are made up, and everything sexual occurs between adults over 18. Some aspects of sexuality in this story are unrealistic; this is a fantasy story set in a fantasy society, in a fantasy universe. 

Thanks to RexBrookdale for being a great help with editing, making this story far better than I could have come up with alone. And a special thanks to the many authors who have influenced my writing. Here's my humble attempt to contribute to the Lit community. Hope you enjoy.</I>

Endangered - Chapter 1 - LTPC

Susan ran down the lane, memory guiding her through the night as she clutched the boy to her chest. He was too big for her to carry for long, but she needed to get away and conceal her presence while she still had time.

Christopher sobbed quietly in her arms as she ran, not understanding what was going on. His father had told him to be good for Susan, and to remember that he loved him. He had then placed a hand on his forehead, causing Christopher to black out, the words 'Be hidden 'til you come of age' echoing in his head. Now, awakened by the sensation of being carried by Susan, he somehow knew he would never see his father again. 

Susan was panting hard by the time she reached the end of the path, sweat dripping down her face. She put him on the ground and grabbed his hand. "Quiet Chris, we have to be quiet," she whispered. They stood silent in the darkness; Chris shivered slightly, staring out into the night, and did as he was bid. 

Focusing on her inner strength, she muttered a spell she hoped would conceal her from elfin senses. The effect of the sudden energy drain made her stagger to one knee, which at least indicated the spell was doing something. "Okay Chris, now we have to <I>run</I>." Desperately, she pulled him behind her as they ran toward the forest. Just as they crossed under the canopy of trees at the forest's edge, their path was illuminated from behind by a gout of flame streaking into the sky, followed by a bestial roar.

"Father!" Chris cried out, twisting frantically from her grip before Susan regained her hold and clamped her hand over his mouth. She hoisted him up to carry him once again, moving unsteadily as exhaustion began gaining a foothold over adrenalin-fuelled exertion. The path twisted as they advanced deeper and deeper into the gloom. Behind them the roars continued for a while, mixed with the sound of fighting, before being cut off. Tears streaked Susan's face and mingled with her sweat, as she ran with her charge into the night.

Roughly 15 years later....

Chris was having a dream. It wasn't a good or a bad dream, yet it was an all-too-familiar one. He was in his room. He knew he was asleep; he lay on his bed, unmoving, unblinking, staring out into the darkness lit by a faint, sourceless, purple light. Presently he could make out the end of his bed, the bedroom door, and his closet. All of the colours were off, much darker than they should be. Objects looked malleable, insubstantial, almost liquid to the point of transparency. He gazed without moving, his eyes changing position every now and then. As the dream continued, he sometimes shifted in bed, rolling over to one side as he slept, facing a new view though most likely a mundane one such as a different expanse of his pillow. These times seemed interminable to Chris, and in the dreams he seemed only to be waiting until he woke up. Mostly he just thought about things: his girlfriend Annabel, homework, computer games, sex, farm work, school, magic, other Beings, dragons.... Anything to pass the dream time. 

At the moment, his view revealed part of the forearm on which his head was resting. Unlike other objects, it appeared solid and wholesome, tinged with a slight purple glow. Chris had thought perhaps he was the source of the purple light. On closer inspection, as the hours of forced boredom marched on relentlessly, he realised the light was ambient, emanating from the air itself ... and yet he seemed to emit it, too. 

Once, a few years ago, he'd dreamt he had seen his stepmother Susan open his door quietly and stand there, watching him. It had been exciting yet somewhat embarrassing to see her ghostly body lit by the purple light, her curves visible through her transparent nightgown. He had stared back, transfixed. While watching him she had leaned against the doorframe, arms clasped together in front of her, unwittingly presenting her breasts seductively to him. He had talked with her about his recurring dream, but not about this one.

The Ether, that's what she'd called it, the 'nothing between everything'. Everything in the Ether was a bleed-through from the Norm, a shadow of its real self. Whatever that meant. Susan had tried to explain that the Ether was like a sub-level of reality, the stuff between dimensions. Everything in the Norm had a small presence in the Ether; on the other hand there were entities in the Ether that weren't present in the Norm: wraiths, sprites, parasites, and plants, living off of each other and from the energy bleeding in from the Norm.

She hadn't known why his dreams took him there. Perhaps it was just part of being a dragon, she'd suggested, something about which he would find out when that side of himself became unlocked. As a witch, she could enter the Ether at will, but the energy costs for entering, exiting, and maintaining a presence in the Ether were very high, and might trap her inside it if she wasn't careful.

Chris shifted in his sleep, the new vista now revealing more of the upper part of his room. The silvery-white moss was growing back. When he had first seen the plant gaining territory along his ceiling, he had tried to scrub it off as soon as he'd woken up, but without any success. Susan had been ecstatic though, immediately retrieving a paint scraper, a ladder, and an enchanted glass jar from her 'magic room'. Spelling herself into the Ether, she'd disappeared before his eyes, only to emerge about a minute later, enervated yet triumphant, holding a jar packed with the white moss. He'd then had to carry her to her bed, and she'd even called in sick the next day, to give her time to recover. Apparently it was all worth it, though. Ether moss was supposedly very valuable as a magical ingredient.

Everything from the Ether was valuable, apparently. Not many Beings had the strength or will even to enter, much less use it effectively. Ether mages specialised in this, but despite her enthusiasm Susan wasn't interested in attaining the much vaunted specialised knowledge. She was happy enough with her lesser magic, plants, and potions. 

Susan ... his childhood nurse and tutor, now the sole parent of a teenaged guy who, apparently, had a dragon trapped inside of him. Chris would have found this hard to believe had Susan not shown him things that couldn't be explained as anything other than magic. Then there was Jethry Dale, the old farmer in whose house Chris had grown up, and who had scared the shit out of Chris the first time he'd revealed himself as a Werecat. No wonder he'd seemed so spritely and quick; unnatural for any normal 78-year-old human. Chris sometimes teased Jethry that it was no wonder he owned a dairy, in response to which he'd hear Jethry suck in his breath with a hissing sound and throw him a look of mock-irritation. Then there were other things. For example, he could smell what other people couldn't, and he had a desire for gold and valuable objects. Sometimes he felt their presence nearby, even when not in sight, especially gold and gemstones. The sensation gave him a feeling of wellbeing and contentment. In fact, Chris occasionally went gold hunting in the mountain ranges on weekends, and his life savings outside of about a thousand dollars was in gold, concealed in his mattress. He'd been quite industrious and now slept on its comforting presence.

Chris had finally become resigned, accepting that there was a dormant dragon inside him. It would come out eventually, a thought both exciting and terrifying. Once it emerged, he would truly enter the magical world, no longer appearing as a human to all supernatural Beings as he now did due to his father's protective spell. Susan had originally interpreted his father's incantation 'Be hidden until you come of age' to mean that when he turned 18, Chris would then be 'of age'. However, that birthday had come and gone uneventfully over a year ago, and his dragon remained hidden. The next logical target date, therefore, would seem to be his 21st birthday, assuming that the enchantment was intelligent enough to adapt to its environment. They were now in America, after all. Susan had brought Chris to live at the Werecat's farm outside of Laramie after fleeing Europe where his parents had died. However, she was far from sure, given that dragons matured much more slowly than humans.

Dragons ... his dragon was the reason he'd had to be hidden. According to Susan, they were almost extinct. Highly valued for their immense powers of spellcraft, longevity, strength, and healing, most were in hiding or under protection. Dragons overflow with magic: a dragon's saliva was a powerful healing concoction, his venom was the base ingredient in the deadliest poisons, and ... his spend was a powerful aphrodisiac that greatly enhanced sexual pleasure. Other parts such as scales, horns, and teeth would be extremely valuable to those involved in darker magic, but usually resulted in the death of the dragon during extraction. There were laws in place to prevent dragon hunting, an ultimately wasteful practice, but this didn't stop some from trying. His mother had died this way, and his father was killed for taking revenge on an elf royal who had hunted her down, or so the story went. Knowing that he would likely die and leave Chris with no guidance after his dragon emerged, his father had locked Chris's dragon inside him with the enchantment, effectively hiding it from the world until he had a decent chance. It was a decision made during a time of great desperation and with an overwhelming sense of loss. So, for all of the potentially great power, strength, cunning, and magic, Chris knew almost nothing about being a dragon, other than what Susan had picked up from his parents.

Chris dreamed he was bored again, staring listlessly at the roof as he lay in bed. Exams and classes had ended several days ago, so no school assignments crowded his thoughts and schedule. Other than the ceremonies and socialising, things he generally avoided, he didn't have any reason to attend. lf Annabel wanted to go, though, he would go with her. She was probably the only reason he hadn't been branded a complete loner at school; having an attractive, well-liked girlfriend had done wonders for his social image. He watched the ceiling some more before the dreaded view of his bedside table wheeled into view, the digital clock perched on top. Now he had to watch the countdown. He had tried turning the clock away from the bed before going to sleep. Ironically, he'd found that not being able tell how long was left till the alarm went off was infuriating. Thus, when the clock was all there was in view, it mattered. 

The time ticked by. Only three minutes remained; Chris started to think about milking the cows. 

5:00 am. He felt himself wrested from the Ether dream, the alarm sounding harshly in his eardrums. Despite being in the waking dream half the night, he felt rested. After moving his legs over the edge of the bed and sitting up, Chris reached for his drink bottle and downed the dregs. Walking over to the switch and flicking on the light, he stretched and yawned a bit, waiting until his eyes adjusted, and then checked himself out in the mirror. He was happy enough with what he saw: a broad and strong body, well-muscled but with a healthy layer of fat over the top. They were real muscles from working. As to the top layer, he was too lazy and hungry to bother with getting the fat off. There wasn't much of it, and it only obscured his six-pack abs a little; he didn't have rolls or pillows so it was all good. Annabel seemed to like him well enough anyway. He glanced at his penis. Extending out proud and thick with its morning cheer, the bulbous head bobbed at him before it started to gradually deflate. Watching his deflation was a strange yet somehow fascinating experience, such a fundamental change occurring right before his eyes. He would give himself a trim down there this morning, in anticipation of what he and Annabel had planned sometime in the coming days. He usually kept himself reasonably groomed, but losing one's virginity was certainly an occasion meriting some extra preparation.

They'd been together for the last year and a half, but hadn't done the deed. She had promised her family, despite not buying into their religious dogmas, that she would wait till she was 18 which was now a few months ago. Chris didn't especially mind. Despite the traumas he'd experienced in his young life, he had also learned that good things came to those who waited. Besides, she gave him blowjobs and he loved eating her out, watching her respond and listening as she came all over his tongue and fingers. He realised he was getting a bit of chub back just thinking about it, so before he could get carried away he got on with getting dressed. 

Heading downstairs Chris put the kettle on, took a leak, made two mugs of coffee, and then carried one back upstairs. He knocked on Susan's door perfunctorily before entering and placing it on her bedside table. Stepping quietly, he moved to the edge of the bed and sat down. "Morning Mom," he said gently. She smiled and rolled over to face him.

"Hey sweetie, oh, you're the best," she said, sitting up against the headboard and turning the bedside lamp on. She reached for her coffee. Sweeping her long black hair away from her face, she looked up with a yawn, and he watched her sleepy blue eyes focus on him. "Did you sleep ok?"

"Yeah.... I had the dream again, though," he admitted. "Anyway, I'll go get started with Jethry. It should be a quick milking this morning, he left a few of the cows in with the calves last night."

"Well at least the dream doesn't make you tired," Susan said, frowning slightly at the thought of the recurring Ether dream. She'd tried countless times to reason it out, but still couldn't fully explain its existence. "So, breakfast at seven?" she asked. "That gives me plenty of time to check the plants and get ready for work, with time left over."

"Sure." Chris got up to head for the door then paused, "Want me to bring any milk up to the house?"

"I think we're okay for today; some eggs would be nice for breakfast though, don't you think?" 

He nodded and strolled off out the door and downstairs.

Susan sighed, sipping at her coffee. They had such a good thing going. She wasn't his real mother, but she might as well have been. They had slipped into the roles so easily. Now, he was finished with high school and would be leaving the nest. She'd given him a basic education about the secret magical world he belonged to, but couldn't teach him magic; not while his dragon lay dormant, locked away. The heart of the conundrum centered around her awareness that she knew so little and yet had experienced the two worlds and their myriad dangers to her most beloved charge. Thus even though she didn't know much about dragons, she also couldn't trust anyone else to teach him.

It would break her heart if anything happened to her boy. "Pffft, hardly a boy anymore," she muttered under her breath. Her mind wandered as she sipped from the steaming cup. In the last year he had really bulked up ... they had even had to get him all new clothes. He ran some mornings and did exercises ... the farm work was the catalyst, no? Chopping wood, feeding out hay bales, lifting vats of milk ... had turned her boy into a fit, tall, broad-shouldered, handsome young man. It made her wonder if this stage marked his 'coming of age'; perhaps his unlocking would occur any day now.

The thought of the release of his dragon sent shivers down her spine. It would be a confusing and dangerous time, yet she was excited. Chris would likely become a whole new person, and she wanted to be there to watch, as the new young man came forth. <I>Would he leave? Would he let me stay with him? Maybe he'd even let me use his powers to aid in magic? </I>The thought of what that might involve made her blush, so she put it aside. Whatever happened, she would be losing her son. Susan finished her coffee and dressed. He was so sweet to bring coffee every morning before going to work. They had fallen into this routine only recently; it had happened all of a sudden one day last year ... he'd just shown up, cup in hand at her door that first morning, and had stuck to it every morning since then. 

It was still dark out; she would check on the outside garden later. Yawning, she made her way down to the basement. Keying in the code for the basement door, she was hit by a wonderful floral fragrance once it opened. "They're actually flowering!" she twittered to herself excitedly.

Susan loved plants: they gave her almost everything she needed for her magic, were wonderful fun to grow, and made her a decent profit on top of her job as a lab technician. The entire space within the large basement had been transformed into a high-tech hydroponics system. Stopping first to check the pumps and filters at one end of the room, she then grabbed a basket and moved out under the lights. 

She grew whatever took her fancy or was useful, including some of the rarer magical species. The one that had flowered overnight was a 'Night Heart' that she had grown from seed; its flowers could be harvested for use in powerful sleeping draughts and anaesthetic compounds. Humming happily to herself she picked a few flowers to dry, and then a few more to keep fresh from which to make a tincture, before doing the rounds to check the other plants. Her work complete, she headed upstairs and outside into the early morning sunlight to work in her garden, glad that it was summer.

Chris was glad it was summer, too. Laramie was bitterly cold in winter. Set on an alpine plateau, there was snow on the ground much of the year. At the moment though, he was comfortable in just his overalls. The herd of 40 cows cycled through the milking machines, kept happy with portions of hay. It was almost 6:30 am by the time Jethry silently showed up. Chris sensed him. Turning his head he acknowledged the old man watching him from the gate. "What took you so long this morning; you sleep in?" Chris jibed. 

"Must have," Jethry replied cheekily. After all, old age had some advantages ... although, as a Werecat he wasn't really aging. "Besides, you've got everything in hand," he said, nodding in the direction of the cows. "Are you going to school today? If you've got time, there's some thistles coming up in the Western bull field."

"I'm going to school; there aren't classes, but Annabel will be there. They have some sort of event for leavers all day. I'll take a look at the thistles when I get back," he said as he unhooked a cow and let her out. 

"Ah, to be young, to be young," Jethry smirked good naturedly. "That girl has you wrapped around her finger." He liked to tease Chris a little sometimes; it was fun to watch him get flustered. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
Chris blushed a little but managed to think up a retort within a respectable timeframe. "I do okay. Besides, being with Annabel beats grubbing thistles all day or hanging around with a lecherous old tomcat."

"Hey, I'm not that old," Jethry retorted. As to Chris's other accusation, he couldn't deny it. They stayed companionably silent for a bit as Chris got another cow hooked up.

Trying to be thoughtful, Jethry waxed serious. "Chris, be careful with her. She's a sweet girl but once your dragon comes out, things will be different. She's only a human and our world is all or nothing."

"I know Jethry," Chris replied, looking up at the Werecat. "I've thought about it quite a bit. When I didn't go dragon last year, it kind of messed up our plans. Susan and I thought that by now we would have moved to Denver for my training and to get protection 'til I could fend for myself. Now it feels like I'm just waiting around for it to happen. I don't know what to do with myself and honestly I didn't think things would ever get this serious with Annabel." He paused for a moment to push up a loose milking cup. "Besides, at the end of the summer Annabel will be going away to Denver to get her chef's qualification." He found it a little ironic that he would be the one being left behind.

"I'm sorry about that, Chris. Probably for the best, though. Besides, you belong with your own kind," Jethry said quietly. <I>It's pretty brutal for humans in our world, </I>he thought to himself. He'd seen all sorts of mistreatment of humans in his younger days as a wandering tom. Things had gotten better in recent years as humans advanced and bloomed, to the point where they now actually presented a real threat to Beings. In direct proportion to their advanced development, care was increasingly required to keep them oblivious. Ironically, many long-lived Beings maintained the old stigmas; humans were still considered livestock, or property by some.

Jethry's last comment raised Chris' hackles a bit. "At the moment she is my own kind. Besides, what does that even matter?"

"It matters more than it should," Jethry said. "You aren't human Chris, even though you appear to be. Who knows what will happen when your dragon comes out? It could be very dangerous for her." Jethry didn't like what he was saying but it was important to pursue the subject; he was the closest thing the boy had had to a father over the years. 

Chris simmered quietly for a moment, digesting the good sense in the Werecat's warnings but hating that it made sense at all. He liked Annabel a lot ... loved her, perhaps. "I know that Jethry," he said, his words followed by a frustrated sigh. "At least we have this summer before she goes away."

"Hunh!" Jethry grunted jovially before breaking into a tune, "Summer loving, had me a blast...."

"Gawd, make it stop!" Chris laughed, glad that Jethry had switched back to his humorous side.

"Just promise you won't knock her up with a baby dragon or something," Jethry joked.

"I ... we aren't ... haven't...!" Chris sputtered before realising Jethry was now laughing heartily at him, leaning against the gate for support. "Awww, screw you, ya dried-up old fart. You're just jealous," Chris joked self-consciously, his face on fire.

"Sounds like there's not that much to be jealous about. I thought you two had been at it for months the way you reek of each other," wheezed out Jethry as he recovered from his belly-aching laughter.

"Soon enough, my furry friend," Chris retorted, chuckling now.

"Bold words. I'll expect details," Jethry said, accompanied by a wiggle of his scraggly eyebrows.

"Yuk yuk yuk! Old man, you need to learn to use the Internet so your frustration doesn't overflow. Besides, I thought Susan said you and Ms. Ashford had a thing? And what about one of the Stevens girls?" Chris laughed as Jethry's face contorted into an expression of comical sorrow. The Stevens were a family of Werecats, the only other such Beings in the local area. They weren't aware of Chris's situation, thinking he was Susan's non-magical human son.

"Nah, that old tart's cats didn't like me, and none of the Stevens pride girls are interested in an old creeper like me." He paused. "So. The Internet, you say...?"

"I've said too much," Chris chuckled, standing up from checking a cow's teat. "I'm pretty much done here and all you're doing is standing around. You can finish up." 

"See you tonight then," Jethry said. He watched Chris make his way to the chicken coop and then back to the house. He smiled. Chris was hard working, quick, and good-natured. <I>If anything, </I>the old tomcat thought,<I> he could use a bit more backbone; but the dragon would take care of that. </I>

Mid-thought, Jethry froze. Suddenly experiencing an epiphany: he envisioned Chris, mature, looking a man and mostly acting like one. <I>If he was still a virgin ... </I>Well, maybe when one 'comes of age'.... That was certainly one way Chris's father's spell could be interpreted, by Jethry at least. Susan needed to know about his theory.

***

Breakfast was delicious if uneventful. Chris followed it up with a shower, giving himself the aforementioned grooming, then changed into his usual school outfit of black jeans, t-shirt, and black boots. His short blond hair did whatever it felt like. A hoodie went into his pack but was unlikely to see use; it would be warm today. He looked forward to the possibility of Annabel wearing a dress, deciding to text her and ask.

He got a reply to his text, just as he and Susan had loaded themselves into her Subaru wagon at 7:40 am.

"Just for you babe. X...." 

He grinned stupidly, then sobered quickly. Susan had seen his expression and asked what the text was about. He ducked the question with a shrug and a little mumble. She wasn't fooled, giving her son a smirk and a playful poke in the ribs before he started the car, the grin back on his face. 

They drove in silence for a bit before Susan spoke up. "So, what are you going to do this summer, now that school's over?"

"I don't know Mom, I know we talked about me going to college ... but there's no point if I might have to drop out halfway through." He paused for a moment, then let the rest of his train of thought come rushing out. "And I thought about becoming a sheriff a few years ago, remember? But, like you said, the same thing applies. Everything is moot till the dragon comes out. I guess I'll just get on with my life, do some stuff I enjoy, and get a job till this all gets resolved. Besides, for Annabel and I, this summer is our last time together, unless we want to try long-distance. We're going to make it count." 

Susan listened quietly. They'd talked about some of this over the years, yet still she felt a pang of sorrow knowing that he was stuck in such an awkward situation.

Chris watched the road and continued confessing his frustration and ultimate resignation. "I think I love Annabel; but it's not fair to stay with her without revealing what's going to happen to me." He glanced at Susan and then back at the road. "From what you told me, I can't protect her as my familiar unless I'm a dragon. But she isn't allowed to know about Beings unless she's a familiar. It's a Catch-22. She probably won't even want to be with me afterwards, anyway. I don't want her memory altered, so ...." He sighed and swallowed. "Perhaps it's best if we go our separate ways when she goes to Denver." 

"I'm sorry Chris," Susan said. This was the first time she had heard Chris say he loved Annabel, though she'd known he'd cared for her. "I wish there was an easier way. But yes," she gestured as she spoke, as if sorting the different points, "when you turn into a dragon, your life will be thrown upside-down. We'll have to move, get new jobs, and you'll start getting your magical training. There are also probably going to be people trying to use or capture you, unless the revelation of a newly-emerged male dragon miraculously stays a secret. It's not going to be safe for you ... let alone Annabel."

"I know, Mom. There isn't really any way around it," Chris agreed dejectedly. He kept his eyes on the road ahead; currently it was straight and flat, no traffic in sight. 

"I'm also sorry I couldn't do more. I mean, I taught you the basics about the different races and our laws but I can't teach you about magic when you can't use it." They'd gone over all of this before, but it didn't make it any easier. Unconsciously she rubbed a palm along the tops of her thighs. "I can't even teach you about dragons; your parents hired me to teach you about being <I>human</I>."

"Susan." He paused, waiting to continue until he could see peripherally that she had turned to look at him. "You've done just fine. Thank you for raising me all these years, for being my mother. I know it was probably dangerous and you weren't obliged to do it so thanks. I love you."

She turned away from him as he glanced over. Tears sparkled in her reflection in the window. He pulled off to the side of the road, undid his seatbelt and hugged her close across the divider, stroking her long hair hanging loose down her back. 

She sniffled a bit before pulling away. "Christopher, don't you dare talk about us like you are a burden to me. I did it because I love you. Watching you grow up has made me so proud, even if I'm not your mother." She tried to sound steady but her voice wavered. Pulling herself together and wiping the tears away, she leaned in and gave him a kiss on the cheek before hugging him tightly for a few more seconds. "Okay let's get going, I don't want to be late. I've got to set up two undergrad labs before lunch."

***

They drove the rest of the way to Laramie, chatting amiably. Susan described her discovery that morning of the Night Heart in bloom. Chris then asked her to tell him more about the mid-Western magical territory under Lady Narlakis. Susan quizzed him about the various races of Beings: Elves, Weres, Wizards, Elementals, Fairies, Vampires ... the list went on. Chris knew the basics such as inherent characteristics, abilities, and predilections. His experience with Beings was extremely limited; aside from Weres, so far he hadn't met any. He'd had to interrupt his recitations of memorized facts upon their arrival at the university. Chris drove up the wide, curved driveway and dropped Susan off with a quick hug goodbye. 

There were still about 40 minutes before school started at 9 am, so he and Annabel would have time to just hang around together for a bit. He parked in the lot a few spaces down from her car. Getting out and locking it up, Chris noted the unaccustomed lightness of his backpack without his books. He debated leaving it in the car, but decided to bring it for his hoodie; it was actually still a little crisp this early. There were celebratory banners everywhere, wishing success to the Class of 2013. He walked around the edge of the nearest building and spied his target amongst the few students milling around out front.

Annabel was leaning against the low brick retaining wall along the front lawn, talking with Steph Lawlill, an attractive classmate who was apparently also going to Denver in the Fall. Chris only had eyes for Annabel, though ... and her dress: light blue with white floral patterns and a few small red blossoms. It left the snowy skin of her arms and shoulders bare, hugged her slim waist and then followed the flare of her hips, before finishing just above her knees. His gaze took in her form, detouring to follow the waterfall of silky, curly brown hair hanging down to the middle of her back, then back en route down her form to her shapely legs and feet, drinking her in. She wore a pair of strappy sandals that exposed more pale skin, covered throughout the cold Winter and Spring. Chris marvelled, spending a final few quiet moments gazing in appreciation at her amazing ass. <I>How did I get this lucky?</I>

He'd approached from behind with quiet steps bordering on stealth, but when he got close she spun around with a wide smile on her face. Steph had seen him coming and had given her a signal. "Gotcha," Annabel said. "You can't sneak up on me." She'd missed him at school yesterday and was delighted when he'd texted her that morning with the request about the dress; it was perfect, in fact, for what she had planned. She took a step closer, looking up at him admiringly. He always looked so damned handsome with his strong jaw, blue eyes, and messy blond hair. His body called to Annabel too: broad, solid, all of that exquisitely dense muscle under his skin ... so heavy when he lay on top of her. She loved that he wasn't entirely skinny either; he had some healthy padding over the firm muscle. Once, Annabel had overheard the coach talking to one of his teachers; apparently it was a 'crime' Chris wouldn't play football, but she'd felt she understood his disinclination. After all, he was a bit reclusive. And anyway, he was usually busy on the farm after school, or hanging out with her. Occasionally she received envious and even raunchy comments about him from other girls. He was <I>hers </I>though. Her big, sweet, caring boyfriend, and she planned to keep it that way. 

"Wasn't really trying to sneak," Chris denied, frowning, initially embarrassed at being caught; but then couldn't help but return her beautiful, infectious smile. "Hi Steph."

"Hey Chris, see you guys in the auditorium," Steph replied. She walked off to leave Chris and Annabel in their own little world.

"Do you like the dress I wore for you?" Annabel asked coyly, giving her hips a side to side twist to raise the hem slightly, knowing full well that he did like it. The hungry look in his eyes when she teased him, made her feel powerful. Truth be told she was chilly in the dress; but it was worth it to see the transparent, stupid adoration spreading across his face right then.

"You're so beautiful, Dee," Chris said quietly, stepping forward to envelop her in a firm hug. He loved using his pet name for her, it fit perfectly. She'd once called him 'Snake Eyes', teasing his bad luck. He'd retaliated with 'Doe-EyEs' and thus Dee was born. In his arms, she was the perfect height to bury his nose in her hair, inhaling her scent mixed with notes of vanilla from her perfume. Speaking of which, he caught a waft of her excitement on the air. He'd recognise it anywhere. Chris squeezed her tighter, slowly rubbing a hand along her lower back. "You're a little bit wet aren't you?" he whispered conspiratorially into her ear.

<I> How does he always know? </I>she wondered, his deep-voiced whisper sending a frisson of excitement through her. She would have been happy to stay in his embrace all day, bound up in his big arms while his gentle stroking sent tingles up her spine and heat to her core that was starting to feel definitively ... steamy. Annabel had reached a decision last night ... one that she'd realised was long overdue. Therefore, she could hardly be blamed for feeling a little anticipation, could she? In response to his whisper she gave a little wiggle, pushing her small breasts into his chest and nuzzling his neck slightly. In that moment, Annabel wished she was more well-endowed up front, with something more to mash into her man so to speak; but such is life. He didn't seem to mind. 

She pulled away from him slightly, and moved up on tiptoe to whisper what she had decided yesterday. "Today," she breathed, giggling when she felt him tense once he understood her meaning.

"Really?" Chris asked, heart pounding at the idea. He guided her away slightly, holding her shoulders so he could see her face. Her expression mirrored his excitement, without a hint of hesitation.

"Yep," she said with a smile. "It's high time. I'll drive us back to your place after school."

"Fuck," Chris cursed quietly as he fantasised for a few seconds, staring at her. "Fuck," he repeated when he realised his dick was rapidly expanding against his jeans.

"Yes Chris, we're going to fuck," Annabel whispered teasingly before bursting into laughter at the shocked look on his face. She stepped back up close to him, wrapping her arms around his neck and pressing her lips to his firmly. Her tongue slipped just along the edge of his bottom lip, enough to get a little taste of him. Chris responded instantly, returning her kiss for a few seconds before separating, giving her soft lips a parting peck and looking deep into her brown eyes, seeing love reflected back.

"I think I love you, Annabel," Chris suddenly admitted. It was out before he realised he'd said it aloud; her eyes had been his undoing and now he felt vulnerable yet elated.

Annabel saw the searching look in his blue eyes as she squealed in delight and jumped up to cling to him, legs around his waist. He stumbled back from the impact of her weight, then steadied them both and held her tightly as she peppered the side of his face with kisses. Joy flooded her entire body at his words. <I>I love you. I love you. I love you, </I>was repeating over and over frantically in her mind, the heartfelt words expressed through her kisses. Freezing for a second when she realised what she was doing, she calmed herself and pulled back to look at him again, still supported by his strong arms around her waist. "I love you too Chris," she said more seriously.

Chris's heart soared. It felt amazing to declare himself and have it returned so enthusiastically. His ear felt a bit wonky from her close-range squeal but he dismissed the irksome ring, smiling so widely he thought his face might break. He gently kissed her again before setting her back on the ground, mindful of them making a scene. Thankfully there weren't many around to notice. He ran his hands up and down her arm and noticed the chill and goose flesh on her bare skin. <I>Vulnerable. Of course, she's cold, she's human. </I>He flashed to the conversation he had had with Jethry this morning. <I>'You aren't human Chris, even though you appear to be. Who knows what will happen when your dragon comes out? It could be very dangerous for her.'</I>

"You're cold," Chris stated, a little sombre now, his former elation shattered.

"Sure," Annabel replied with a giggle. "But I couldn't care less." He had finally admitted it to her. "You love me," she whispered conspiratorially before laughing giddily.

"Yes. I do," he replied, as if stating a fact, his response lacking an accompanying grin. He pulled his backpack off of his shoulder and retrieved the hoodie for her. 

She accepted it gratefully and put it on. It hung baggily around her tallish, slim frame, reaching down to just below her butt, yet she hardly noticed, distracted by the sense that something had cut short his post-admission high. 

"Okay babe, let's get going," Chris put an arm around her waist and guiding them toward the auditorium. He needed to find a secluded spot and have a serious talk with his girlfriend.

Something might have dulled Chris's good mood, but Annabel was the happiest she had been in her life. She leant against him as they walked, absolutely content, floating in the clouds. Her heart was happily thumping, recirculating good feelings all through her body. Skin tingled wherever he touched her so she pushed in closer to his side. 

As they walked together, Chris pondered how to explain. He had to do something; he couldn't selfishly lead her on without giving her some sort of warning. Sighing, he leaned over as they walked, pressing his lips to the top of her head. He really did love her. Thrills coursed his body as he felt her awkwardly pulling herself tighter to him. <I>She loves me! </I>part of his mind continued to shout gleefully, while another part dreaded what would happen next, all the while rehearsing what he was going to have to say.

***

The auditorium was empty. Chris pulled Annabel up the steps to the second-to-last row, then along it to the seats in the furthest corner. He sat for a minute, collecting his thoughts frantically as she snuggled into him.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
<I>He's tense. </I>There was something wrong, but she couldn't understand what could have him this wound up. "What is it, Chris?" she asked as the disquiet seemed to escalate, threatening to envelop them both. Slowly, she sat up in her chair and turned to look up at him.

<I>She knows. </I>Chris panicked, almost reaching the point of chickening out. "Okay, where to begin, ah ... shit," he said in a flurry of words as he tried to steel himself. Annabel looked at him confused, a slight frown marring her pretty features. "Okay. Ummm, just listen Annabel, please just listen. I have to tell you some stuff. Serious stuff about me but I can't explain it all right now, I'm not allowed to. God this is going to sound so stupid but I don't want you to get hurt – " 

Annabel cut him off. "Chris! I know you're not stupid enough to be breaking up with me right now, especially after what we just said; so what the hell is this about?" The unease grew inside her at the pained look she saw plastered across his face as he avoided her gaze.

"No! God no, I don't want to break up with you babe, I love you," Chris assured, meeting her eyes momentarily before dropping them again. "Look.... Just.... Fffsssshhhh," he felt freaking terrified, hands wringing and clammy in his lap.

"Hey," Annabel quietly reassured. "It can't be that bad, just tell me." She reached over and took hold of one of his hands. The strength with which he clasped hers in his now-clammy grip almost made her wince; maybe it <I>was </I>bad.

Feeling slightly better, Chris forged ahead. "Alright. This will sound strange and stupid but it's the truth. Okay? Well, at least part of the truth, I can't tell you the rest now." He paused to see if he could gauge Annabel's reaction. 

She just nodded. 

"I'm in hiding," he resumed, focusing on making his explanation as clear as possible. "I didn't do anything wrong, but some ... people might hurt me if they knew who I was." 

"Like witness protection?" Annabel interjected, then cast furtive glances around the auditorium, looking around like she feared eavesdroppers. This was more serious than she'd thought.

"Not really," Chris answered. "Please Dee, I can't tell you the whole thing. In a few years something is going to happen to me and I'll stop hiding ... but my life is going to be flipped upside down, it could be very dangerous."

"Why? What's going to change?" Annabel asked, confused. "Why can't you tell me?"

"I can't tell you because if I did and those people found out, you'd be in danger." Chris said it pleadingly, hoping it would be a good enough reason. "Annabel ... believe me, it's very dangerous. My parents were killed for something to do with all this."

"Your parents were killed?! Who by? Wait, Susan isn't your mom?" Annabel was incredulous. It all seemed unbelievable; but the desperation in Chris's voice, and the way he was wound up so tight convinced her he was being sincere. The part about his parents and Susan really threw her, though. Annabel had known Susan for years; they got along great, and she knew they both loved Chris. How could Susan not be Chris's mother?

"Susan is my mom but not my biological mother, she was kind of my nurse till I was four but when my parents were killed she looked after me and we've been in hiding all these years. I can't tell you what happened to my parents, honestly I don't know the whole story anyway," Chris paused to work out Annabel's expression. "I guess ... oh, I don't know. I had to tell you that stuff before we go any further. I love you Annabel, but in a few months you'll go away to college in Denver... I don't want to lead you on."

"You could come with me," she said hopefully.

"No, I need to stay hidden. Besides, you won't want to be with me after this whole thing comes to light," Chris said dejectedly. 

"Bullshit, Chris, I love you; so don't turn this around on me. I want to be with you and as long as you still love me, that isn't going to change," Annabel scolded, angry that he was cheapening her feelings for him. "I'm going to Denver in autumn and I want you to come. If you don't that's up to you, but I've got all summer to convince you, and I haven't even started trying." She suddenly shifted in the chair and moved over to face him. Straddling his lap, she leaned up and mashed her lips against his. If this was so serious she would give him something to fight for ... prove she wanted them together. Her tongue demanded entrance to his mouth and she nipped his bottom lip, pulling herself closer when he tried to get away. After a moment Chris relented and opened up to her, lifting his arms up and around to hold her. Annabel slammed her tongue home and they were locked in a slippery duel for a few moments before the kiss mellowed. She moaned quietly and broke for air with a gasp, holding his face in her palms.

"I can't come to Denver," Chris started.

"You will," she countered.

"It'll be dangerous."

"You'll protect me."

"I'll change."

"And I'll still love you."

"Fine," Chris relented, "don't say I didn't warn you." The smile on his face told Annabel he was happy with the outcome. Unable to dissuade her, Chris could do nothing more than appreciate her devotion. Although she by no means knew the whole picture, he didn't feel like he was taking advantage of her anymore.

"I'm sorry about your parents," Annabel said, lowering her hands to play across his chest absently.

"It's okay. Susan is a great mom," Chris said. His own hands on her waist weren't idle either, thumbs stroking her soft tummy through her clothes.

"So ... Susan's your mom now and you're in hiding. Something important is going to happen to you and some people might want to hurt you?" Annabel clarified.

"Pretty much."

"And you can't tell me because it would put me in danger. If this is a joke I'll frickin' kill you, Chris."

"Yes, yes, and no joke. I'm deadly serious. Damnit, sorry, that last was an accident."

"Give me something here, Chris. A clue; what's it all about?"

"Magic," Chris said truthfully, knowing she wouldn't understand. He watched her eyes widen in surprise briefly, before she brushed it off as his way of deflection.

"Whatever. I'll entertain this craziness on the condition that you seriously think about coming to Denver with me. I don't care about all that other stuff." Annabel sighed a little, adding, "And stop petting my tummy, you know it fires me up."

"Okay," Chris replied a little sheepishly, stopping his thumbs yet he still had to touch her, and settled for attempting to encircle her waist with his hands.

"So, here's what's going to happen," Annabel stated more lightly. "You're going to kiss me. We'll stick around here for a while. I'll drive us to your place. We'll have sex, and you'll be damned pleased about it."

"God I love you," was all Chris could say before they were at each other again, lips locked passionately, only coming apart when people started to enter the auditorium.

***

The rest of the day flew by surrealistically. There was a farewell speech given by the principal, and then one by a guest speaker from out of town who emphasised the importance of doing what you loved and not letting opportunities pass by. Lunch was a barbecue for the graduating students, staff, and faculty who didn't have classes with the younger grades. Everyone was saying goodbye and making plans for the summer, while Chris and Annabel sat together and snuck kisses when they thought no one was looking. They talked to a few friends and made plans to go to a leavers party the following Saturday. By 2 pm they were ready to go.

Chris drove Susan's car to the university lot and met Annabel there by the curb at the entrance; Susan had her own keys and would drive home after work. Annabel had purchased her own car last year, ostensibly to drive to work at Mishroy's Steakhouse where she was a chef's assistant. Her parents hadn't liked it but it was her own money. She and Chris had taken advantage of the freedom and privacy it afforded them over the past year, to Annabel's parents' consternation. She loved her parents dearly, but honestly couldn't wait to be out of their stuffy, rigidly pious house for good.

Chris got in and they drove off in nervous anticipation, toward the farm. 

"Your parents?" Chris asked, feeling like he had to run a checklist to assuage his nervousness.

"At work. They don't know I'm staying over, but I'll deal with that in the morning," Annabel replied. "Susan?" she asked.

"She's cool, we've done stuff before when she's at home, she must have heard us. Besides, she won't be back for hours," Chris confirmed. "Protection?"

"I'm on the pill, you've got the condoms."

"Jethry?"

"Will either be asleep or listening at the door," Annabel joked.

"You're probably right about that," Chris chuckled. "You're sure you want to do this? Even after what I told you today?"

"Yes, Chris, you're not backing out now. We're going to lose our virginities and it will be wonderful. Besides, I've practically been frothing at the mouth all day," Annabel said huskily, squirming in her seat in an attempt to scratch her delightful itch and wind Chris up.

"I know," Chris admitted. "I can smell it."

Annabel stared at him for a few seconds before putting her eyes back on the road. "That's hot," she breathed a moment later.

They drove for a few more minutes in silence until they turned down the long driveway. 

Chris asked, "How are we going to play this?"

"We're going straight upstairs," Annabel replied.

As soon as the car was parked, they got out and practically raced to the house. Chris held the door for Annabel, then followed her close up the stairs, placing a hand on her firm behind, feeling her body move. The hand felt scaldingly hot to Annabel, who happily accentuated her stride for him.

Reaching his bedroom they fell upon each other, wildly kissing as Chris pushed her back to sit on the bed. Standing above her, Chris removed his t-shirt and Annabel reached for the hem of her dress before he stopped her. "Can you leave it on for a bit? You look so gorgeous like that," he asked tenderly.

Annabel looked up at his impressive stature with desire smouldering in her brown eyes, knowing what he wanted from her and happy to oblige. Chris had a thing for getting blowjobs while she was still fully clothed. "Okay babe, just get your shoes off already," she said, giggling as he almost fell over in his rush to comply.

As he stood, sans footwear, she rose from the bed and ran her hands along his solid chest and down his abdomen, hinting at where she would go soon. She could feel the strong muscles tensing under the surface as she explored her man lovingly, stepping closer to get a taste, kissing across his chest and toying with a nipple while her hands snuck to play with his jeans-entrapped erection. 

She was torturing him, sending tingles across his skin and shivers up his spine while his stiff penis lay cruelly imprisoned. He gave a desperate groan as the feeling of her skin and silky lips made him shudder in anticipation. "Please Dee, you're driving me crazy," Chris panted. "Please, suck me." Mercifully, Annabel kneeled, trailing kisses down his slightly padded abdomen as her hands undid his belt and zip. 

Lowering his jeans and boxers as one, her prize sprang into view, erect and bobbing. Leaning in slightly and looking up, her wide chocolate pools held him transfixed as she placed a kiss on its thick head. Annabel thought his penis matched his physique perfectly: above average in length, built wide and heavy. It was nice and big, just like he was.

He gasped as she opened wide to envelop the crown within her wet heat, bucking his hips slightly in reflex and bringing a hand to lovingly stroke her cheek, pleasure coursing directly to his brain. She lowered her soft lips along the shaft toward his root, tongue slowly lashing around his head and savouring his natural taste. On her upstroke she made sure to apply suction and just a hint of teeth, revelling in the laboured breathing, groans, and facial expressions she could draw from him as she methodically built up her pace. Annabel couldn't take him all the way in, having tried previously but finding the challenge too great; instead, she used one hand to grip him near the base and jerk him slowly as she entombed his cock in her sweltering mouth.

Chris was in a state of lusty delirium, slowly thrusting into the ring her pretty lips made around him as she engulfed his shaft in hot, moist, pleasure. With the pink gloss on her full lips and her beautiful, happy eyes, she excited him far beyond simple physical stimulation. He panted, moaning in ecstasy, a light sweat forming on his brow as his abdominals clenched and he struggled to hold back. Her sweet lips were stretched near their limits to encircle him and seal him in her hungry mouth, but her eyes were always his undoing: brown, loving, and twinkling up at him from beneath her eyelashes, holding his gaze throughout, her intense expression begging him to come too soon. She looked so sensual, kneeling in her pretty dress, lips around his shaft while her tongue worked its unseen magic. His picture of her as a nubile innocent was corrupted by her lusty stare and those little sounds that escaped from her lips, as she tried to smile while her tongue traced the ridge of his cockhead. A tingling in his sack warned him, and with a strangled groan he very reluctantly pulled back from the blissful edge, and with his last bit of willpower, he fought to free himself from her hungry suction. "God you're amazing," Chris blurted as he regained his breath and composure. 

Annabel grinned happily, wiping spittle off her chin, knowing she had almost had him, and delighting in the act of pleasing him. Her own breath was uneven, cheeks and neck flushed beautifully, sex aching delightfully; it felt like she was about to melt into her panties. She needed attention immediately. "Chris, undress me," she demanded.

Swift to oblige, Chris lifted her up from where she knelt and ran his hands under her dress, then up and over her slim frame, relegating the dress to the floor. Those strong hands brushed around her ribs to unclasp her bra at the back, sending tingles anywhere he touched. Her small breasts were revealed, protruding only slightly from her chest with tiny brown areolas and matching, now-puckered, nipples. Chris gave each beautiful little cupcake a swirl with his tongue and a gentle suckle, drawing a whimper from Annabel who, he knew, was very sensitive when she got this wound up. She wore a padded 32A most of the time but Chris would have happily played with her cute, rounded little tits all day. After a while he kissed down along her tummy to her navel, relishing her soft and smooth skin. She loved it when he worshiped her belly button with half-erotic, half-ticklish tongue strokes; it always made her insides clench. Reaching the top of her slightly frilly white panties, he nuzzled into her fragrant humidity wafting through the moistened fabric. His hands stroked over her firm, peachy ass, catching the edge of the fabric and pushing it along to bunch at her ankles. She quickly stepped out of them.

Exposed, Chris kissed a smooth, milky thigh before he ran his tongue over her swollen pussy lips, collecting her familiar, delicious taste. He rested his nose in her trimmed patch of brown curls and brushed the tip lower to occasionally tease her excited clit. "Fuck! Ooooohhh yes ... Chris ... oonnnhhhaa ... that's so good," Annabel exclaimed as bliss rocked her body and she grabbed his hair a bit roughly, pulling his hot tongue further into herself. Chris got the message, parting her petals and delving into her juicy pinkness as moans and profanities spilled out of her sweet mouth. He pushed his tongue inside and laved then thrust deeply for a few minutes, as she writhed on his face, building her up then retreating to swirl his nimble tongue over her clit, triggering her climax with a little suction. Annabel screamed out her pleasure unintelligibly, her entire body wracked with waves of bliss as she held herself against his mouth. Eagerly capturing the slickness escaping her quivering pussy, he savoured the essence of her womanhood and its salty fragrance with hints of tangy sweetness. As he tasted her pleasure, delivered by himself, he made sure to support her shaking body as the orgasm drained her.

Slowly he laid Annabel down in the middle of his bed while she caught her breath, small aftershocks making her beautiful body twitch every few seconds. Chris left her there to retrieve a condom from his drawer, undoing the package and rolling it down over his meaty shaft. He then joined her, lying on the bed, kissing her breasts, then up along her collarbone to her delicate neck, and finally to her lips. Still in a pleasure-induced stupor, though recovering quickly, she kissed back sloppily but with fervour; he was already lighting another fire within her. Annabel need him inside her, longed to feel his big cock filling her, taking her. "Now ... Chris, I need you now," she moaned, desire tingling through her body wherever they touched.

Delivering one more kiss and whispering his love in her ear, Chris got on his knees and positioned himself. Annabel opened her snowy legs wide and high. Shaft in hand, he ran the head along her slick lips, bumping her clit, making her wriggle and arch. Despite the apprehension she felt, she looked up at him and gave a nod, knowing it would hurt but that he would be gentle. Chris shuffled forward slightly, his butt resting on his heels, thighs flush against hers. He put a reassuring hand on her waist, stroking her tummy while the other positioned himself at her scorching entrance, her swollen pink lips already kissing the very tip. She placed a hand over his and gave it a squeeze: she was ready. Chris trapped her gaze in his own and slowly pushed his hips forward, groaning as her lips parted reluctantly to accept his thick crown. They gasped in unison as the entire head submerged completely, continuing slowly, deeper through her narrow, untried channel. Chris held himself still when he reached her maidenhead. How incredibly tight and soft she was! Looking down at their joining, Chris marvelled at how wide her pink little pussy had stretched to accommodate him.

"Do it quick," she whispered. 

Chris looked at her and saw the determination in her eyes. Gripping her waist firmly with both hands, he pulled himself out slightly, his shaft coated with her juices. She gripped his wrists in final approval. Looking into her eyes, he pulled her down onto him as he shoved forward quickly, tearing aside her barrier and sinking deep, almost to his root with an unintelligible shout. Annabel shut her eyes tight and whimpered through the pain as Chris lowered his torso on top of her, holding her close.

"You're so brave," he told her gently between heavy breaths, holding himself still inside her. "I love you so much ... and Annabel ... oh god you feel so amazing.... thank you!" As she adjusted to him Chris tried to distract her, kissing her ear, neck, and finally her lips. She kissed back more enthusiastically as the pain slowly dulled, replaced with a decidedly satisfying fullness. She experimentally clenched, feeling him tense up and suck in a ragged breath in response. Reaching down along his body to her sex to feel around their joining, she discovered that he had not sunk himself to the hilt; a little yet remained outside of her.

"Okay ... I think I'm ready. Chris, I can't believe how full you make me feel ... just ... go slow, okay?" she panted, reaching up to wrap her arms around him, letting her legs relax and fall further toward the bed.

Slowly he pulled out a few inches, her pussy clutching at him, then gently thrust back into her, making a little headway. Trying again he was almost undone when she decided to clench him tightly, preventing his escape. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
"Fuck, you're tight Dee! Gnnnghhhhaa ... stop! I'm not going to last!" he warned, pausing deep within her until he could regain control. Gritting his teeth, he pushed forward till she engulfed him completely, watching her eyes widen at the sensation of pleasure.

His head gently butted up against the entrance to her womb, as deep as he could penetrate. There was a little splash of pain as he pushed to the hilt, but Annabel cooed in delight, the last of her pain washed away by waves of euphoria, feeling every inch of him. "Holy shit, that's deep ... Chris, I can feel you in my belly." 

Holding himself there, he basked in the feeling of being completely inside her sweltering, tight pussy, his balls against her flesh and his body pressing her down into the bed. It felt so right to be like this with her, as intimate as possible. Annabel was also enjoying the sensation, his thick shaft was filling her completely, twitching slightly every now and then, sending pleasure coursing through her body. She rotated her hips experimentally and felt it stir her insides delightfully, touching places she was unaware had existed. He felt so nice and heavy on top of her, sinking them both down deeper into the bed. 

Slowly, he pulled out. Annabel whimpered as he withdrew, fighting for every millimetre he removed, but then squealed with joy as he surged all the way home again. Tense with the effort of holding his impending orgasm back, he thrust in, withdrew to his head and re-sheathed fully, repeating stroke after stroke into her velvety depths; and was rewarded with the honour of watching Annabel's monumental sexual awakening, up close. 

His paced thrusts rubbed everywhere inside her and started to stimulate her engorged clit, eliciting a series of joyful little sounds from her lips against his neck. She came alive, moaning, whimpering, clutching, grasping, kissing. As she bucked her hips to meet his thrusts, he felt his full testicles tingling, drawing up in anticipation. The delightful build-up made him pump more forcefully into her inflamed pussy and pull her tightly to him with an arm underneath her back. Annabel reciprocated, instinctually wrapping her legs around him to spur his actions, arching and nipping at his shoulder.

This was so much better than she had ever dreamed. His wonderful cock touched everything inside of her, even kissing her cervix gently when he'd pushed as deeply as he could. They were built perfectly for each other. She felt herself building quickly under his masterful thrusts, her pussy fluttering, leaking a trickle of juices she could feel seeping down between her cheeks as she sped toward her climax. Mashing their bodies together and moaning her pleasure into his ear, she needed to feel him come with her. 

"Oooaaahhhhaa! Yes! Come for me, Chris ... oh, shit I'm going to come too.... I love you," she squealed brokenly, panting with exertion and bucking on the edge of orgasm. At her words, Chris thrust harder for a few strokes until Annabel's entire body quivered and tensed. "Ohhhh gnnhhh ... aaah!" she managed as her pussy clenched, releasing a gentle stream of joy as her entire body tensed and released, toe-curling pleasure exploding behind her eyelids. 

Her spasming almost unseated Chris, who shoved himself firmly to the hilt with a muffled shout as thick ropes of come surged up his shaft into the condom. He held himself at full depth as her delighted snatch milked his cock. He looked down at her, drinking in the absolute beauty of a woman coming beneath him as he came and came, groaning and mumbling in total abandon until he'd spent his last spurts. 

As Annabel gradually relaxed, he stirred himself slowly in her hot core, and gave a few short, experimental thrusts with his softening cock, prolonging the pleasure. They stared into each other's eyes for a moment before kissing slowly with a new depth of feeling. Finally he pulled back and reluctantly exited her spent pussy with a slight plop and an accompanying whimper. Chris noticed a small amount of blood, so discarded the condom and cleaned them both with tissues from his bedside table. Annabel was staring up at the ceiling as he lay back down beside her, pulling her into his chest and nuzzling her hair. 

"That was amazing, thank you," he said reverently. All she could muster in response was to press her lips into him sleepily and make a contented little mewl.

Encircling her soft body, happy tiredness started to overcome him too. Chris felt fantastic; his only small niggle was a strange feeling in his chest and stomach. It felt unsettled, like there was something moving slightly inside him ... not enough to cause concern in the aftermath of great sex, he dozed with his arms wrapped around his lover. A man now by any definition, he had finally come of age.

***

He was woken sometime later by his own hyperventilations. Something was very wrong. A searing heat rattled around in his chest, burning his insides and making sweat drip off his naked body. He knew it was his dragon, felt it instinctually as it burned hotter still, like white-hot, molten metal jumping inside him. He struggled not to scream in pain, his mind racing as the dragon inside burned away the barrier between them.

Annabel was still somehow asleep, snuggled to his feverish skin with her face almost touching his heaving chest. 

<I>Get away from Annabel! </I>This was happening too soon! She wasn't prepared to accept his dragon, hadn't yet taken his warnings seriously, would hate him, be terrified. 

Rolling away from her and off the bed with a thump and a strangled cry, he started crawling toward the door, sobs wracking his chest as the fire spread from his chest to the rest of his body. He didn't get far before collapsing with a gurgling moan.

"Chris?!" came her worried cry. She had awoken abruptly, her heart pounding, alone in the bed with noises of agony nearby. 

The room was darker, an hour or two must have passed but it was still light outside. Squinting through the dimness, she spotted Chris's form where he lay face-down on the floor, twitching and crying out. She sat up and flicked on the light on the bedside table, then scrambled out of bed and over to him. "Oh my god!" Kneeling beside him on the floor, Annabel reached to touch his shoulder but withdrew suddenly. His skin burned her fingers. "You're burning! Chris, are you alright? Can you hear me? What happened?" she queried in a panic.

During a lull in the intense pain, he took the opportunity to warn her. "It's happening," he croaked, his throat dry and cracked. His flesh seemed to be sloughing down his oesophagus to feed the fire in his chest. She had reached for him again, so he invested his last remaining energy in the next words, "No! Annabel get away from me!" 

She backed up a bit, moving more out of shock at his reaction to her presence, than in obedience to his desperate warning. Annabel froze as she witnessed what happened next.

Suddenly, the pain stopped; he had half a hope that it was over, when something powerful surged into his mind, and his limbs began thrashing. The dragon was in his mind now, struggling with its own consciousness, mentally digging its claws and teeth into him and holding fast. Chris choked, tears streaming down his cheeks, helpless as he felt his own soul surrender, ceasing its weak resistance. Gradually, the dragon quieted. It had won. 

Like water that had stilled only momentarily, both felt the rippling sensation as it started merging with him, pouring itself into him, just as he was poured into it. Mixing and stirring together, they blended to create one Being, one soul. With a feral roar of triumph echoing through every chamber and crevice in his mind, Chris became complete. Unbeknownst to him, his body had simultaneously begun undergoing its own transformation. 

Annabel stared as a rich purple colour, originating at the base of his neck, spread out slowly across his back. His face was obscured from her view, yet she could see the flush of deep purple as it spread up his head, turning his skin and even his hair purple. His body seemed to be growing slightly, though she couldn't be sure. As the purple transformed his arms, Annabel got definitive proof that he was growing; and in its wake as it passed, it left his muscles slightly more defined underneath.

However, this was forgotten as she watched a line of what looked like ... scales, blossom and spread down his neck and across his spine; a smaller set growing outward and another smaller still following those. Ever smaller scales now spread, halving in size and halving again and again, until a few inches from his backbone, they had grown so small that she couldn't even make them out. The ever smaller scales spreading away from his spine soon caught the advancing purple, travelling down over his buttocks and thighs, around his ribcage and down his arms. His once-fair skin had completely turned purple, with gradations to slightly paler amethyst in front as it spread around his ribs across his belly. Meanwhile, larger scales travelled down his spine, becoming smaller as they reached his tailbone and stopped altogether. One final, narrow scale emerged, much longer than the last two combined, accented by four unique, creamy white-coloured bumps along its sides and one at the very tip. 

Something rippled at his shoulder blades. Suddenly, Annabel snapped out of her half-conscious state, her overloaded mind scoffing at this new development in her lover. <I>This can't be real, I'm dreaming. </I>Annabel was about to try pinching herself when she remembered the dull ache in her slick nethers and other newly well-used muscles. Looking down briefly she inspected the sticky evidence of her wonderful deflowering, her sex puffy and sore. Convinced that it was all real, panic and confusion flooded her brain. <I>What the hell is going on?! </I>

The answer came to her as she looked back at Chris, a large pair of leathery purple wings that she had been watching in disbelief as they grow out of his upper back, were complete and now lay, folded neatly. The upper joints raised above his head, the lower tips brushed against his sculpted purple ass, each ending in a razor-sharp, hook-like, white claw. 

"Magic...," she breathed.

<I>Hi everyone. Thanks for the awesome feedback on chapter 1, please keep it up because it makes my day. I am also happy to accept suggestions on how I could improve.

This chapter follows directly on from chapter 1 so make sure you read that first. As such, the format is a little different from what I would usually go for... in this case, the sex is at the start .

Disclaimer: Placenames are real but are mainly used as points of reference, people are made up, and everything sexual occurs between adults over 18. Some aspects of sexuality in this story are unrealistic, this is a fantasy story set in a fantasy society, in a fantasy universe.

Thanks again to RexBrookdale, editor extraordinaire, who also tries to keep me level-headed. 

I hope you enjoy.

Endangered - Chapter 2 - LTPC

***

One wing twitched ... the first movement she'd seen from him since he had passed out. It set her off like a frightened rabbit, scurrying back onto the bed and as deep into the corner as she could go, flush against the wall. Heart pounding, her hyper imagination came up with terrible scenarios in which a winged purple beast shredded and devoured her. Annabel fought her panic, trying to think logically, <I>Is this what he tried to talk to me about today? Oh my God, he ... he isn't ... human! Is that, that thing, even still Chris? </I>Panic and fear dominated her reason, as she pulled the duvet up around her trembling naked body, hoping to hide herself from the rousing monster.

Chris lay with his eyes closed, concentrating, his senses having returned suddenly to crash against his consciousness with new and vibrant information. Myriad changes notwithstanding, he had just arrived at the happy realization that his mind was still intact. However, there was something ... he could somehow feel that he was different, powerful, alive ... free! These nascent feelings seemed strange to his logical human mind, and carried a distinctive, ancient-yet-feral, dragon quality. Smells were overwhelmingly pungent, and the sound as he breathed, thundered in his ears. Cracking his eyes, his blurry vision cleared quickly and was somehow brighter, images sharper and more defined. More blues, more reds. 

His body trembled with the raw power now constantly coursing through it, cooling down in the wake of burning through his father's enchantment. Those strangely textured instincts originating from within his dragon, told of being tougher, stronger, faster ... <I>better. </I>

Slowly pushing off the floor, Chris halted, catching sight of his purple hand splayed against the grey carpet. "Well thiss wass unexsspected," he mused to himself at the sight of short, cream-coloured claws in place of his fingernails, framed by purple scales so small he could barely see them, even with his newly-enhanced vision. "What the hell?!" he muttered, hearing the quality of his voice. A little deeper and with a slight sibilance, he would have to work on keeping hisses out of his voice. Speaking of which, his tongue explored the inside of his mouth curiously, finding a pointier, sharper environment. The tongue itself seemed to be able to touch two places at once. Chris stuck it out cautiously; the two prongs of his forked tongue wiggled gently, though the rest still appeared human in shape.

The view downward brought to light an even more shocking change. His nose no longer obscured the view of his tongue, having become flattened and smoothed back into his face. Feeling along its contours, Chris found several other differences: his nostrils were slit-like, his lips were thinner, and a formation of small bumps pointed back in a line underneath his hair just above his temples. Opening his mouth, fang-like canines were at least a centimetre longer and sharp points could be felt along the rest of his teeth. It all sort of made sense, if, as he suspected, he was currently a hybrid of both dragon and human forms. The dragon agreed.

He examined his front, his chest and abdomen now creamy white, blending with the purple as it wound around his sides. With one arm he reached back to partially extend a wing. The leathery webbing was supple and smooth, purple on the back, creamy white underneath, sharing his body's colour scheme. Any part of him that was equivalent to a dragon's underbelly was this lighter ivory, included his palms up to his underarms, his chest, neck, tummy, and ... penis. On cursory inspection, the shape of the latter had changed, too, with a more flared, wider glans, and strange pointed tip. He was amused that the merge between the white and purple travelled the underside of his shaft, leaving the top creamy with a strip of purple along the bottom, giving him a legitimate case of blue balls. 

Gone was any trace of body hair. He checked for it everywhere: chest, back, pubes, ass crack, legs, arms, face. It was all gone except for the now-purple hair on his head. Somehow, these changes felt natural, right even ... he was truly a dragon. 

But why purple? Susan had told him about browns, blues, reds, greens, and silvers, but never purple dragons. 

A dragon's colour reflected it's aspect, or magical element. What was his aspect, then? The answer came to him from within, the dragon simply sharing its instinctual knowledge as if Chris himself had known it all along but had only just now recalled it: <I>The Ether. </I>

The revelation was conferred with nonchalance, his dragon having known this from the beginning. It explained his purple-tinged dreams: the colour of the Ether – <I>Of course! </I>he realized suddenly, <I>this was why he had so often dreamed of it. </I>

Slowly rising to his feet, his new wings ruffled a little. Chris tilted back to look up at the leanly muscled forewing, its clawed elbows at least a foot above his head. It was only right that a dragon had wings, wasn't it? Catching his reflection in the long mirror by the door, Chris took a few steps forward to inspect himself. His purple and white body looked powerful, magnificent, dangerous. With a dragon-induced chuckle at his own magnificence, Chris scrutinized his face in the mirror. Reptilian eyes stared back, their vertical irises taking in the lines of his new purple visage. Chris could still see himself in that face, despite the new definition of his nose and cheek bones. Smiling, his sharp white teeth were revealed, points interlocked to provide maximum slicing and penetration of his prey. The dragon preened inside him, his knowledge providing access to the foreign muscles. Chris tentatively extended them to open his wings, watching in awe as they unfurled magnificently. At full extension they reached at least two metres on either side of his body, one tip was currently extended through the doorway out into the hall. Strong bones and muscles stretched along the leading edge, purple-finger struts supporting the thin flight webbing. He felt new muscles tensing down his back and around his ribcage, attached under his arms and down across his back. Would they actually support him if he attempted to fly? His dragon said yes.

Retracting them slowly, Chris turned to fully observe his scaled spine. He saw the progression of ever smaller scales and followed them with a finger. A little further and he couldn't even tell that tiny scales even existed. Running his hand back around and over his abs, his skin felt just as smooth and sensitive as before, but with a subtle difference in the way light was reflected. 

His forked tongue flicked out to taste the air. The flavour explosion he experienced when his tongue withdrew inside his mouth was perhaps the most revelatory experience so far. Smells and tastes he didn't know existed and couldn't identify, lit up his brain with an overload of information. However there was one scent that was very familiar, drawing Chris abruptly away from his self-admiration. Annabel. His head snapped to the corner of the room where she huddled, attempting to hide under his duvet. She gave a tiny jump under the blanket as his head swivelled with lightning speed to look straight at her. 

She should have been his first concern, but he'd gotten carried away with his new body. Trying to move unthreateningly, Chris slowly edged toward the bed. The duvet pile trembled as he got on the bed, kneeling in the opposite corner. Sighing, Chris slumped, knowing that it was all over. She now knew about his dragon; they would have to alter her memory.

"Annabel. I'm so sorry." Chris started, not really knowing how to continue, "I never thought you would be exposed to this. I thought by the time this happened to me I would be long gone. You don't have to be afraid, I would never hurt you."

There was a pause in the trembling and Annabel peeked out behind her improvised cover. "Chris?" came her whispered voice. His deep voice was still gentle and reassuring but he seemed to put a bit more emphasis on his 'S' sounds.

"Yes. Dee it's me, I know I look scary but it's me," Chris implored, extending an arm to try and coax her back to him. "I'm so sorry it happened like this."

Annabel lowered the duvet completely and stared open-mouthed at the creature in front of her. He looked dangerous, terrifying, entrancing, and beautiful all at the same time as he knelt on the bed a few feet away, an arm outstretched like he wanted her to go to him. It looked so out of place, this beautiful monster kneeling on the bed, looking crestfallen. "What are you?" was all she managed.

"I'm a dragon."

"How is this possible?" 

"I was born this way," he sighed. "My parents were dragons; but when my father knew he was likely to die, he placed an enchantment on me, which hid my dragon away while I grew up so I would be safe." 

"This is why you said you were hiding? What could possibly hurt a dragon?" 

"Dee ... there's a whole magical world you don't know about. Dragons are endangered because they were hunted. I tried to warn you about this but my dragon was released much sooner than I expected. It must have been when we had sex." As he spoke, Chris was putting things together in his mind. It must have been losing his virginity that had triggered the breaking of his father's spell.

"I did this to you?" Annabel's voice trembled.

Chris saw her uncertainty and pain and couldn't help rushing to embrace her. However, the sudden advance of a purple, winged man, moving quickly across the bed toward her made her jump back and cry out in fear, forgetting momentarily that it was Chris. He managed to capture her trembling body and hold her softly against him, petting her back. "SShhh. It's okay, Annabel. It's me, it's okay. I didn't mean to scare you like that; I just wanted to hold you. None of this was your fault, it's just who I am. All we did together was unlock this side of me. I don't regret a second, I love you," Chris soothed, pausing before continuing to the painful part. "You weren't meant to find out about this but it's okay, if you don't want to stay with me I'll go. It'll be like I never existed." Chris's heart was breaking and the dragon was snapping his fangs in anger at this promise to leave their mate. 

Annabel calmed as he spoke to her, melting into his warm, firm chest as he stroked her. His scent flooded her lungs, imbuing her with a sense of comfort. It took a moment to process his last sentence but she realised he was leaving her. She took another deep breath and it was as if a switch had flicked on, like he called to her entire body, willing her to go to him. Rationality was thrown aside; she loved him, how dare he leave her? Closer: she wanted, needed to be closer, to belong to him whatever that might mean. Clutching and clawing, Annabel latched herself onto him, determined not to let go. "Don't Chris! Don't go please!" she wailed, tears streaming down her face as she wormed her way against his creamy white neck. "Please. I need you, I love you," she begged.

Chris was startled by her response but quickly tried to comfort the distressed Annabel. He hugged her tightly in return, trying to ignore that she was desperately grinding her body into him, legs locked around his waist. "Hey. Hey, I'm not going anywhere, Dee. Not unless you want me to. I'm just saying that as an option in case you understandably never wanted to see me again, I thought you would flip out and run away screaming. I'm so happy you still want me." 

"Of course I want you, you're a beautiful dragon. I'm yours." Annabel replied automatically. <I>Wait yours? That's strange, I should be a bit more freaked out right now, </I>she thought, while pressing her lips into his skin wherever she could reach. He was so smooth and warm, he smelled great too, definitely masculine with a hint of sweet, spicy smoke. <I>I should stop this... Oooo! I bet he tastes great too. </I>Her addled mind reasoned, swirling her tongue on his skin where she kissed, delighting that he tasted just like he smelled. She couldn't stop herself. 

Something was definitely wrong, Chris was relieved at Annabel's vehement affirmations but now she was trying to lick him all over, moaning breathily as she sucked and nipped at him. He got distracted as she toyed with a nipple, all the while rubbing her pussy slickly against his pubic bone with her ass cheeks teasing his hard on. His dragon was purring inside him, happy with the way she worshiped their body. He snapped out of it when she put her tongue in his armpit attempting to find the source of his delicious smell. The tickling brought him back and he had to forcefully push her away and hold her still as she writhed against him. 

"Annabel, what's gotten into you? Stop. This isn't right." Chris worried.

"Chris! Oh!" Annabel panted, struggling to get back to him. "You smell so good, I just want to taste... What's happened to me?" 

Regaining some control she looked up at him, focusing on his concerned purple eyes. The shock of noticing that they were now reptilian brought her back, he was a fucking dragon. He blinked and she saw a membrane retreating to the side of his eye, he had another see-through eyelid underneath his human set, it was so odd that she noticed it now. There was something wrong with her, she could feel her emotions raging out of control. She loved him so much but now it was like she was desperate to be possessed by him, to prove herself worthy of being his. Her body was hot and achy, starting to sweat a little, it felt like there was a fire in her womb, leaking molten desire down onto him where she squished her mound wetly against his skin. 

"Chris, what did you do to me? I'm burning up. Oh my god, how wet am I?!" 

<I>Dragon struck </I>came the pleased response inside his head as he felt her juices flowing down onto his balls, dripping onto the bed while his pulsing cock twitched between her cheeks. "Oh Dee I'm so sorry, I think you're dragon struck, it's like pheromones or something. I don't know what to do!"

It was too much, Annabel couldn't resist it any more as the slim control she had over her desires slipped back into a lusty craze. "Take me," she whimpered.

"No! Annabel, fight it." Chris said desperately trying to hold her still while she writhed to get him inside her.

"Do it! I love you Chris, take me, claim me!" Annabel screamed, her desperation flaring at his resistance.

"No Annabel, not like this! You're not yourself, you're drugged."

"I don't care!" came her ragged response. What she was experiencing was delicious, but dangerous at the same time, like some unknown doom would befall her if she didn't convince him soon. "Don't you want me?" she asked, seeming vulnerable for a moment. 

Chris relaxed a little, letting his guard down at her hurt expression. "Of course I do, it's jus – "

She took her opportunity and clawed her way back to his body, wrapping around it in a death grip. Chris tried to pull her away but couldn't without risking hurting her. His dragon tried to tell him that this was normal for the first time between dragons and humans but Chris was unmindful, distraught that he'd done this to her, that he'd somehow played with her mind. <I>The female loves you, she needs you to claim her, reassure her that she's yours. Our scent only amplifies her desires, among other things. It doesn't create themm, </I>his dragon informed him, eager to sink into Annabel's tight, hot flesh. 

<I>We will have a serious talk about your affect on the people I love once this is resolved </I>Chris projected ominously. 

<I>We are one being, I love her just as much as you. Now shut up and give her what she needs, </I>came the startling reply.

While their internal debate raged, Annabel had secured her position. Locking her ankles and wrists around his broad body, she pulled herself up to his ear. "Fuck me." She demanded.

"No," came Chris' stony reply, now determined to fight both her and his dragon.

"Please Chris, I need this," Annabel almost sobbed in his ear, squeezing her entire body into him. "You aren't taking advantage, I want this so much it hurts!" 

"I won't."

"God damn it Chris, fuck me!" snarled Annabel, fed up with his noble stubbornness. He said she was under his influence, but that didn't matter to her; the love and want she felt in that moment were so great her body hummed, sweat and heat rolling off her. All this and he wouldn't help her get what she instinctually knew she needed, his seed in her belly.

"No – " Chris felt a roar of pain burst out of his lungs. 

Upon hearing his negative, Annabel had suddenly sunk her teeth into his ear. It wasn't the word she'd wanted to hear. 

Just as suddenly, a brutally strong clawed hand gripped the back of her neck and pulled her off of him. 

"Petulant female!" the dragon snarled in her face, fangs flashing.

"I'm sorry! I don't know why I did that," Annabel quaked, terrified at his rage. The metallic taste of blood set her lips and tongue tingling, as if she had just swallowed hot sauce and was waiting for the full burn to start.

The dragon loosened his grip on her slightly. "It is good, in a way, little one; your tenacity pleases me."

"Chris?" Annabel asked tentatively.

"I'm here, you just brought the dragon to the foreground. We are one Being but each have our own impulses," his dragon allowed Chris to explain, looking her trembling body up and down appreciatively. 

"Now, as to your demands," his dragon resumed. Abruptly she was released from his taloned grip and he watched her slump down against his body, her legs still wrapped around him. Grabbing her narrow waist roughly and lifting her easily, he ignored her weak protests. He positioned her above his markedly more bullet-shaped and flared cockhead, using her engorged labia to kiss the tip, lubricating it thoroughly. She whimpered quietly as he held her in place, teasing her with her own desire as she bucked to impale herself. Soon enough he lowered her, in complete control as his cockhead pressed home suddenly, stretching her wide as it popped in and then drilled deeper, agonizingly slowly, inch by glorious inch. 

It was all too much, whatever he was doing to her, it was just too much. Her body quaked, his penis, so hot and thick inside her, inching slowly upward into her. "Yes! Chris! Ohh ... mmm," the words died in her throat as she came halfway through his penetration, her ecstatic pussy fluttering, wetting him further with a little trickle of her cum. She shuddered, calling his name, cursing him, praising him as he continued to sheath himself in her scorching pussy, pushing through her convulsions. Finally he reached the end of her passage and stilled for a few moments, allowing her to recover. She squeezed her arms and legs back around him as he held both of them in a seated position. He twitched inside her, making her jump. 

"Oh my god; you're bigger?!" she asked incredulously as the feeling of being stuffed with a large dragon's cock prolonged her post-orgasmic bliss, twitching and squeezing him.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Only a little bit." Chris whispered in her ear, reaching up with one hand to hold her head gently, he kissed from her ear around to her mouth. Tasting his own blood there, he licked it away while kissing her softly. Annabel attempted to slide her tongue into his mouth but retreated at the feel of his sharp teeth; instead, their tongues waged an increasingly feisty duel within hers until Chris pulled away. "I'm going to fuck you now Dee," he growled, grasping a large fistful of her thick hair.

All she could do was look up at him, doe eyed as he ground his thick crown deep inside her with tiny thrusts. Her pleasure laced with intense sensations bordering on pain, she came again in just a matter of seconds, bucking and undulating her tummy as he demonstrated his mastery of her needy body. Again she flooded him with her juices, soiling the sheets below as she tried to scream in ecstasy but no sound came out of her gasping mouth. The orgasm didn't as last long but that didn't matter, within seconds he started pulling back, fighting her tightness as he raised her up, holding with only the thickest part of his head at her opening before pulling her back down again, battering his way into her spamming pussy. He was being rough with her, it was slightly painful but in the moment his animal passion and dominance felt exactly right.

Feeling her velvet walls clutching him, heat nearly overwhelming, he thrust up into her strongly, still with a measured and relatively slow pace he pulled her smaller body down to meet him. His dragon revelled in how amazing it was to sheath himself almost to the hilt over and over in her tight body, he might go deeper but didn't want to cause her too much pain. Arching his head, he let out a roar of triumph, wrapping her tightly in his arms, one hand on her supple, tight little ass, the other crossing her back, still gripping a fistful of her soft brown hair, tugging a little. With this unbreakable hold he thrust into her franticly, taking shorter, more powerful strokes, growling into her soft neck. 

Annabel was moaning constantly, pleasure coursing her twitching body, trying to meet his thrusts but realising that he was totally in control. She was being fucked by a dragon, her dragon. She felt him deep inside her, filling her again and again, creating glorious friction everywhere. She heard the lewd squelching noises they made as he pumped into her, heard his roar of pleasure and felt him increase his pace. Her orgasm crept up on her, surprising her with its sudden intensity after only a few more moments of his fervent thrusting. Her body locked again as he thrust a few more times before her trembling, tense pussy forced him to slow, attempting to coax its reward from him but failing. He held her brutally tight, crushing her into his white chest. Riding her pleasure she muffled her screams against his shoulder and before she knew what she was doing, sunk her sharp little teeth into him again.

Chris was enjoying the feeling of her contracting around him, hearing and feeling the woman he loved come apart in his arms when she bit him again. Hard. It hurt, he knew it would heal, his ear had already started, but it really hurt, pulling him back from the brink. His dragon however was pleased they had such a feisty bedmate, eager to show her who was in charge, who had the fangs. It was like whatever affected Annabel was instinctively making her goad and rile him into a frenzy.

Chris let her finish her orgasm, still locked onto his shoulder but when her twitching stopped he pulled her roughly off him with a moist squelch. Annabel protested weakly as he dumped her on the bed, turned her and pulled her up by the waist, ass in the air with her swollen flower displayed for him, her pinkness now a darker shade. She was still contracting automatically, winking at him as he ogled her peachy smooth butt, running his clawed hands gently over her alabaster skin, squeezing greedily on her giving flesh.

Recovering, Annabel panted into the sheets as he explored her proudest feature. She might wish occasionally for a more womanly pair of tits but she thought her ass was superb; so did Chris, apparently, as he took his time with her wonderful bottom. Suddenly he reared up behind her, using a hand to guide himself into position, her knees were together on the bed so he had to push his thick shaft between her cheeks to reach the drenched heat of her vagina. Putting a hand on each snowy globe, he pulled her back onto himself slowly, mindfully watching for any sign of displeasure. This was perhaps his second favourite part of sex, sinking into her slowly, seeing it with his own eyes as he felt it with his slick, throbbing erection. It felt so good, so right and she gave a cute little gasp when he seated himself fully, sexily watching him over her shoulder. 

Stuffed inside her burning soft flesh, he lowered his body over hers, pulling her up into his chest so his mouth was at her ear. Very slowly Chris began taking tiny soft thrusts, grinding himself into her, stirring all around inside her the dragon whispered in her ear, "Do you feel that, Dee? You're mine. I'm going to fuck you like an animal 'til I fill you up." Annabel just whimpered and bucked back against him slightly, dominating and possessive, exactly what she needed to hear from him. "You'll be my fist, my Familiar, and one day you'll bear our children. All this because I love you, Annabel." Chris poured their combined feelings into her ear, feeling her clench him in approval.

"Yes!" she cried in response, "I'll do it all, Chris. Anything! I love you." She turned her head back awkwardly and he met her, attacking each other's lips, tasting, nipping. Their slippery tongues met for a few moments before the position became a little uncomfortable. Chris broke away with a gasp as he began thrusting more forcefully into her, feeling her arch and slam her butt back into his oncoming thrusts. He pulled her back with him to a partial sitting position, toying with her small breasts with one hand while the other held her waist. Her mouth would latch onto anything he put in her reach, currently she twisted her head was licking and playfully biting his healed ear while he leaned his head down to her, covering her smaller body with his. He tweaked a little brown nipple in response, reminding her to be careful, she obviously had a thing for biting. Feeling her silken pussy tense on him in response, Chris realised he was only seconds from the end. 

Automatically his wings began to enfold them, twitching in excitement as his heavy purple balls tingled and his penis throbbed in pleasure, stiffening, expanding a little. Annabel felt him get a little bigger, harder and knew he was about to come, a little surprised but ultimately not caring that his wings made a tent around her. She was very near her own climax, panting and moaning as he played havoc with her breasts and stoked her insides toward ultimate pleasure, just a few more moments. He thrust harder on his last few strokes, that delightful peak before the fall seemed to teeter for a timeless moment before he shouted out his victory, seating himself against her womb as his muscles contracted and he felt spasms race down his length, released his potent seed into her, spurting powerfully down his thick shaft into her waiting depths. He felt an urge to sink his fangs into her sweet neck but held back as pleasure flooded his addled brain.

To Annabel, it felt like he was drenching her insides with his hot, viscous come, splattering her walls with force. This new sensation was the icing on the cake, unaware his come had magical properties, she fell into her soul-shattering climax with a wail at the instinctual knowledge that he was claiming her completely, mating her. Arching against him and pushing his sensitive crown up into her cervix as he fired off shot after hot shot, she milked him for all he was worth. Chris felt her come, her pussy going crazy all over his over sensitised cock, it was almost painful till her body when a little limp as he finished inside her, eyes shut, gasping for breath, he held her tight as they writhed in bliss.

He held them locked together for several minutes, enjoying the feel of completeness as they literally dripped onto the bed. Not wanting to leave her yet, Chris folded his wings back up and rolled them onto their sides. Her heaving, flushed body pulled back into him with protective arms. He felt his love and devotion for this wonderful young woman reach new heights, she wanted him despite being a dragon. It would be difficult but he would make a good life for her in his world. "Dee," He said gently.

"What?" she cooed.

"I'm so happy you don't want to leave me. Things are going to be strange but I'll fight for us to be together. You were right you know? I'll protect you and I'll always love you, Dee. Okay?" Chris managed to mumble into her hair, smelling her slight vanilla scent mixed with sweat and pungent sex.

"Of course you will," She replied, turning to face him, forcing his softening penis out of her with only a small gush of fluids. The majority of his spend remaining inside her, millions of years of evolution making it inhumanly thick and sticky, to remain inside and insure his successful mating. Annabel looked up at her lovely boyfriend-dragon. "I'll stay with you as long as you'll have me Chris, no matter what else happens, I love you." 

Finished with their affirmations for the moment, they cuddled for a while before Annabel fell asleep again, pressed up against him. Chris looked over at his clock, it was only 5:30, at least an hour before Susan got home. He had time for a nap too before that craziness started. Breathing deep, Chris drifted into his own satisfied sleep.

***

The Ether, he was dreaming again. For a moment he savoured the feeling of Annabel's warmth as her sleeping form pressed against his front, breathing against his chest. He slowly stroked a finger over her ghostly shoulder and along her arm, exploring her softness in the purple light he cast and the ambient glow of the Ether. Sighing, he raised his head and looked at the clock. Not having slept very long, Susan should be home soon and he needed to get up.

<I>Wait... I can move...I'm awake! </I>Chris's mind whirred. Sitting up abruptly he missed that his arm passed right through Annabel, who crumpled into the space he previously occupied, curling into a ball. Clearly he was now in the Ether, lucid and in control of his body.

Chris felt a little bad about leaving her, but he wanted to explore while he had a chance. The unfamiliarity of having wings was startling, but Chris didn't know how nor want to go back to his human form at the moment. Annabel was still sound asleep so he reached down to brush her arm and whispered, "I'll be back soon babe." She didn't respond so he caressed down her ribcage and over her naked hip, pressing a little firmer over her creamy globes, he got the shock of his life when his hand sank into her shadow-form's flesh.

"Holy shit!" Chris exclaimed, ripping his hand back, leaving Annabel still obliviously sleeping. <I>Wow that's cool, how does it work? </I>He wondered. As an experiment he reached out for his bedside table, feeling its ghostly shadow as a firm object when he touched it lightly but finding that if he pressed harder his hand could pass through it, sinking into the wood as if it were just a very viscous liquid. The implications where staggering, Chris might be able to walk through walls, pass through objects and people, travel anywhere. There were also some more serious things to think about, what if he left the Ether while his hand was inside something else? <I>Would my hand fall off?! What if part of him was inside someone? I need to get educated, </I>he thought, vowing not to try anything too fancy before he got some guidance.

Putting these thoughts aside, he decided to continue with the planned exploration but first glanced backwards at Annabel. She really was absolutely beautiful, a kind, loving soul encased in a cute, lithe little body. His dragon purred, content with both her nature and physical form, she would be the first of his brood. <I>Brood?! </I>Chris asked incredulously, not noticing that his wings clipped right through the doorframe. <I>Yes, brood. We will gather desirable mates. Protect and provide, they will come to us and together we grow strong, </I>the dragon responded as he strolled the ethereal hall and descended the stairs. Chris scoffed that his dragon seemed so self assured, he knew that he probably couldn't be completely exclusive to Annabel now that he had awoken but he certainly wasn't planning on pimpin' up a harem. Annabel would be his girl, any others would have to be part of contracts or favours.

Everything in the kitchen and living room seemed normal, from the Ether anyway, so Chris opened the front door and walked out onto the porch. His first look outside was somewhat anticlimactic, he hadn't been expecting a magical rainbow wonderland but it pretty much just looked crepuscular except everything was ghostly and the faint violet light was everywhere. Looking up, he saw the sun as a bright globe, now low in the sky, but it didn't seem to provide any direct illumination and didn't cast shadows. He could see just as far as he could in the Norm but now everything lacked its usual colour, a grey/purple scale instead.

To the left, growing up the porch and onto the outside of the house was a faintly glowing white vine. Another Ether plant Chris assumed, perhaps Susan would appreciate a sample later. Out on the gravel driveway he walked towards the barn past Annabel's parked car, taking in everything around him. Even the clouds were here in the Ether. So were the animals, he noted as he past the chicken coop. However, the wile ghost-birds seemed to sense the proximity of a predator and quickly sheltered back in their house with a fluster of clucks and squawks.

Jethry heard the commotion from the barn and sallied forth to shoo off whatever vermin was harassing his chickens. However, only a few steps down the driveway he stopped dead when his neck hair prickled. There was something magical nearby, stalking around his property. He couldn't detect anything out of place with his catlike senses but that didn't mean it wasn't there. Looking all around with his enhanced vision, partially transforming into his cat, he scanned for the unseen threat with a menacing hiss. Nothing was out of place but Jethry knew there was something powerful watching him from concealment.

For his part, Chris was startled when Jethry immerged from the barn and all of a sudden went cat-mode with a hiss, looking around like he was preparing for a fight. His dragon growled in challenge but realised after a moment that the old werecat must be sensing his own presence, just like the chickens. Chris tried to talk him down but failed, "Jethry, it's just me you old coot. My dragon awakened." He said, but got no response. Trying to wave his arms, he shouted but it was clear Jethry couldn't see or hear him. "Shit," Chris muttered as he gave up.

Jethry's thoughts went to Chris, perhaps they had been found out. Warily he got out his old flip phone to warn Susan, hoping desperately she picked up. He was warrior, trained to fight and protect but he couldn't go up against a powerful magic user, not alone anyway.

"Hi Jethry, I'm just driving home, let me just get this headset thingy... okay what's up?" Susan answered. Chris, standing not two metres in front of Jethry's shadow form could hear their conversation and thought it strange that sound could enter the Ether form the Norm but didn't seem to be able to escape in the opposite direction.

"Susan, there's something here, I can feel someone nearby but I can't see or smell them. They're concealed somehow, they're powerful." Jethry muttered into the phone, trying to minimise the chance of being overheard.

Susan's mind blanked for a second, her most terrible fears beginning to flesh themselves out. Someone had found them, come for Chris.

"Susan?" Jethry queried, hearing no response.

"Where's Chris?" She asked, panic tinting her voice.

"He's in the house. Annabel's here, they came home a couple hours ago but just now the chickens started making a fuss and when I went outside I felt it nearby, it's still here." Jethry explained quietly.

"Ok," Susan answered trying to calm herself as she stepped on the gas, thankful that she was already past the city limits. "I will be there as fast as I can. What do you feel from it?"

"I don't know," Jethry responded. "It's just here. I can tell it's watching me but I can't pick it up with any of my senses. Susan, it has a very powerful aura, like it doesn't care that I know it's here. I think we're in deep trouble if it makes a move." 

"Shit!" Susan said, "Jethry it takes a very powerful spell to completely mask all the senses, especially to a were-Being. I couldn't do it myself. Just...just wait. If it hasn't made a move by now perhaps it's not going to. We might be able to make a run for it."

"Guys! It's me!" Chris shouted into the phone, face to face with Jethry. He tried to grab the phone out of his hand but just passed through Jethry's arm and part of his face.

Jethry jumped back with a snarl, turned, and ran for his house. He had felt it pass through him, the cool tingling of the entity phasing through his own body. They were really fucked. "Susan! It just phased me, I felt it go through my head!" Jethry shouted as he bounded through the door into his house, heading straight for the gun safe. Anyone that could phase was bad news in any fight.

"No! Jethry this can't be happening, don't let them take Chris!" She sobbed, dropping the headset and focusing on driving as fast as she could. <I>How could this happen? </I>She was so sure no one knew about Chris, perhaps she had gotten complacent. Speeding homeward, she fought back tears as different scenarios played out in her mind's eye before a cool rage blocked out everything else. Nothing would take her Chris, she wouldn't allow it.

Chris was left standing in the driveway between the two houses and the farm buildings, perplexed with his situation. He wasn't worried about an imminent threat, apparently he was the threat...to himself. At the same time he didn't want to cause any more panic for Jethry or his Mom but didn't know how to get out of the Ether, previously he would just wake up from his dream.

All he could do was wait till Susan got home, hopefully she would be able to sort it all out or Annabel would explain it. He walked back towards their house, sitting on the steps to wait. The minutes passed slowly as he sat, observing things through the Ether, the novelty of the transparent, ghostly reality quickly wearing off. <I>What if I'm stuck here? </I>He thought, Susan would work things out and retrieve him from the Ether, eventually.

His dragon stirred, bored to be sitting still when it had only just awakened, it wanted to hunt, fuck, or fly, anything exciting really but Chris was just melancholy he had caused such an upset. Jethry could be seen stalking his own porch, pump action in hand, so Chris just waited, passing the time with a little more self examination of his strange dragon body.

Only 10 minutes later, Susan sped into sight down the dusty driveway, taking advantage of her wagon's 4WD. Skidding slightly to a halt, she was slamming the door behind her inside a second. Storming up the path Chris thought she looked like an angry goddess with her long black hair flapping around and murder in her sparkling blue eyes. He reminded himself not to piss this witch off. Susan was about to start up the steps when Jethry joined her, they paused to look at each other, Jethry with his claws and shotgun, Susan with menacing power rolling off her.

"Can you sense it?" Jethry asked, "What is it?"
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
"Yes," replied Susan coldly, "and I don't know. You say it phased through you?"

"Yea, right through the front of my head, it could have killed me but it went all the way through." Jethry almost whispered. 

Meanwhile Susan was expanding her magical senses, probing around to discover the identity of the concealed threat. She felt it nearby, powerful and definitely watching her. Annabel was upstairs, asleep by the feel of it. Chris was nowhere. Susan flipped.

"Where is he?" She hissed, quiet at first with hatred dripping off her words. "I know you can hear me you son of a bitch. What did you do to him? If you've hurt my son I kill you!"

Shocked, Jethry realised Susan must be addressing the Being in hiding. "He's gone? But how?" he asked.

"This mother fucker can phase so who knows. Give him back you bastards!" Susan wailed, desperate to vent her anger but unable to find an opponent.

Chris was frantic to calm the situation, Susan was distraught that he had apparently been taken, when in reality he was standing in front of her. Unable to gain her attention, he tried to give her a reassuring hug. Wrapping his arms around her and pulling her shadowy form close, he wish she could see him. "I'm sorry Mom, it's just me, I'm fine." He comforted, hoping somehow that the message got through.

In fact, it was Susan who got through. As Chris hugged her, he pulled her into the Ether with him. Susan felt the Being begin to phase through her and tried to struggle, fearing an attack. But half a second later she felt a shift, her Ether shadow fleshing out as her physical body in the Norm disappearing altogether, which made Jethry snarl. Despite a drain in energy, Susan heard her son's plaintive words. She stilled her struggles to look up at his unfamiliar visage, seeing her awoken son in his true form, seeing that they were in the Ether.

"Hey Mom." Chris said gently as she sagged in his embrace.

"Oh Chris, I thought were gone...You...You've awoken." She sighed, relief washing over her as she began to see more and more of her son in the Being before her.

"Yea, Annabel and I ... umm ... you know ... sex, and then I transformed." Chris mumbled, embarrassed.

"Ahh, okay, good for you. That's fine. What are you doing here?" Asked Susan wearily, blushing only a little, the drain of staying in the Ether was starting to take a toll. "How did you bring me here?"

"I don't know, I woke up here after I went to sleep and now I can walk around. Apparently my aspect is the Ether. It sucks though because I can't get out. Am I trapped here?" He explained.

"Well that explains...I guess I just assumed the worst. But I've never heard of an Ether dragon Chris. I'll tell you how to leave the Ether but I don't have much time to explain, it drains me quickly to stay here. How long have you been in the Ether?" Susan asked.

"About half an hour I guess, maybe a bit less. I feel fine." Replied Chris. "So how do I get out?"

"Hmm, the way I do it is to picture myself at a door, the Ether on one side, the Norm on the other. Remember how I explained that it's just another layer of reality, like a different dimension? Well, just open the door with your mind, it can take a bit of energy, and step through. Chris I really need to get back now, I mean just look at Jethry." She said.

Jethry was stalking around the front porch, waving his shotgun and cursing up a storm, his words interspersed with cat-speak Chris hadn't heard the like of since two cats had a fight in the school playground in 5th grade. It was almost funny.

"Okay Mom, go and calm him down. I'll try to follow you." Chris assured.

Susan released herself from his arms reluctantly, he had a new alluring smell which was disturbingly enticing. Only as she stepped away did she realise her son was naked the whole time. "Oh my..." Was all she managed before she fled back to the Norm and proceeded to calm a very startled and confused werecat.

Chris watched the scene calm down for a bit before he attempted to exit the Ether. After all, he didn't want to pop out and receive a shotgun blast to the face for his troubles. Picturing the door he felt resistance when he tried to open it. He tried again but couldn't seem to make the idea work. Frustrated, his dragon laughed at his efforts. <I>We are an Ether dragon, do not bother with doors, just go there. See yourself where you want to be, see yourself in the Ether or the Norm. 

Oh yeah? Helpful all of a sudden, are we? </I>Chris snapped. He got no response, so relying on the pro tip, Chris pictured himself back in the Norm standing behind his mom at the bottom of the steps.

Then he was there.

***

"Whoa, cool!" Chris started, "Hey Mom, I think I just teleported or something."

Susan and Jethry spun, startled at his sudden appearance despite having had time to prepare for it.

"One moment I was standing over there where we talked. Next thing, I'm here behind you and back in the Norm." Chris gesticulated, looking himself over as if the answer lay in his new body. "How does that work?" When he didn't get an answer he looked up to see his audience just staring; varying emotions and degrees of open-mouthedness played across their faces.

"Honey, that's nice ... but I don't know how it works." Susan said, rousing herself from examining her son's new form. "I'm an amateur when it comes to the Ether. I know Ether mages can use it, to phase and travel very quickly, kind of like how some elementals can atomise themselves to travel and reform at their destination." As she spoke, Susan was reduced to shameful ogling. He was truly magnificent: powerful, masculine, dangerous, and beautiful. She took a step forward tentatively, reaching out to touch his shoulder as if under a spell.

Jethry was silent, eyeing up the dragon as his cat's instincts would size up a potential threat. To him, Chris reeked of raw power, and their former relationship was now quickly reversed as his cat recognised the new male's dominance. Once his cat had come to terms with it, Jethry relaxed a bit. Still, he held back, to give Susan a moment with her son, and to observe the newborn dragon.

"Chris, you're taller." Susan realised as she had to look higher to meet his eyes. He used to be about 6'1'' but in this hybrid form he must almost be 6'5''. "And those wings! Oh you're going to have so much fun honey, I'm so happy you've finally awakened. I know your father did it to protect you but I always thought it was a cruel fate to deny you your nature," she gushed excitedly as she ran a hand down his arm to hold a massive, clawed hand. "This form is fascinating, I only ever saw your mother once like this you know. A mix between human and dragon, it makes sense though since the Were races can have half forms." She ran her hands over his, examining the colouring as well as his scales and claws. "You're colouring is strange Chris," she said looking back up at him. "I've never heard of a purple dragon."

Chris just watched passively as Susan examined him, initially embarrassed that she didn't seem to care he was naked although his dragon had said they had nothing to hide.

Susan peeked around his side to look at his large wings."It is the colour of the Ether though, which raises even more questions." Susan continued, "I can tell you will grow to be very powerful Chris, you already are. It's kind of scary actually, if you weren't my son I'd be very wary right now. Actually, I think I am still a little scared." She looked up at his reptilian eyes, reassured she could still see her loving boy as he gazed back at her.

"Mom, don't be scared. I'm still me ... just a little different," Chris assured, trying to smile comfortingly.

His white fangs flashed; Susan involuntarily gasped and took a micro step back. Chris realised what he must have done and toned down his grin to a close-mouthed smile. This was truly a huge change, her realized; his own mother was afraid of him in this form. Susan saw a little sadness creep into his eyes and admonished herself for her reaction; she'd wanted to support him through this. She stepped back up close, and hugged him. Chris wrapped his arms around his mother thankfully; a hug was exactly what he needed. Almost. 

"I love you, Mom," he said. "Sorry about the teeth."

"I love you too honey. I'm Sorry I reacted like that, it might just take me a little while to get used to the new you." Susan responded with her head against his warm, creamy scaled chest. As she breathed she became more aware of his delightful scent. A smoky, spicy, manly blend which she could happily get used to. "Hey, at least you won't have to use men's cologne ever again," She said, trying to provide a little humour. Chris froze.

"What?" Susan asked, pulling back a little to look up at him. "What's wrong with that? You smell nice, sexy even."

Chris gently pushed her back to arms length and took a step away. Retreating like she had something he didn't want to catch when really the reverse was true, remembering the effect they had on Annabel. "Ah ... um... So, I have pheromones now" he said awkwardly, not really wanting to elaborate further.

Susan tilted her head, confused at his reaction, until she felt her body's instinctive pull to get closer again. "Oh," she said, answering her own question. Realising she was feeling a little flushed, the telltale beginnings of arousal, her nipples stiff against the cups of her bra. "Oh," she repeated, blushing furiously and turning away slightly, embarrassed.

"Oh my god," Chris backed up, mortified that he had now affected Susan too. "Jethry, I think you'd better take care of the chores this evening, the animals don't seem to like me much at the moment, and I don't even know how to change back."

"That's fine Chris, come see me tomorrow before you head to Denver," said Jethry, happy for an excuse to evade an awkward situation. The dragon was still Chris underneath his new skin, so they were good. He turned and headed back to his house, processing the bizarre circumstances of the last half hour.

Chris looked back at his mother for a second before shaking his head, retreating upstairs, wanting to distance himself; his powerful olfactories had detected a faint womanly odour which only confirmed his fear.

"Chris I'm sorry, I forgot dragons could do that. It's natural, okay? Nothing to be ashamed of." Susan tried to console her son while getting her body firmly back under control. 

"It's bad enough Annabel got dragon struck," came his response from upstairs.

"Annabel? Oh... I'm magical Chris, I can resist it better and maybe there's a spell I can use to reduce the effect. I'm sorry I embarrassed you, alright honey? It's no one's fault, you're a very alluring Being," Susan reasoned. 

"I can't believe this is happening. Clothes, I need clothes!" Chris disappeared inside his room and closed the door.

"Shit," Susan muttered, "could have handled that better." Pheromones aside, the appeal of his half form was not lost on her. She was his mother but objectively, Chris was possibly the biggest temptation she had ever come across in her 38 years. "Speaking of big," Susan mused aloud to herself, with a heady giggle before reining in her imagination. "Stop that," she admonished, how was she going to guide and support him if she made such jokes and comments, even to herself? Heading back to her car to retrieve her stuff, she started to mentally plan for the trip to Denver first thing tomorrow. With Chris awakened, they needed to get the protection of the ruling Lady as soon as possible. Chris had such a powerful magical presence she wouldn't be surprised if some of the most sensitive psychers were aware of his awakening, they were no longer hidden.

Passing the stairs on her way to the kitchen she called up to Chris that she would start dinner, still feeling her body's desire to get close to the dragon. 

***

Chris sat on the edge of his bed, awkwardly rubbing his forewings, he had banged them on the doorframe. Annabel was still asleep, beautifully sprawled across his bed. Honestly, he was scared. His affect on Susan brought to light just how ill-prepared he was for this, that there were unforeseen consequences of his awakening that weren't necessarily all good. What if he didn't want to arouse women when they caught a whiff of him? How was he supposed to blend into human society?

Susan wasn't even the real issue anymore as he despaired a little at the death of his own humanity. And what was with these mood swings and powerful emotions? "Fuck it," he murmured, getting up to put on a pair of old sweatpants, at least his dick wouldn't be flopping out in the open at dinnertime for his mother to see. A shirt proved impossible, 'wing cut' wasn't a standard t-shirt style at K-Mart.

Perhaps most unsettling were his own feelings regarding Susan, sure he was embarrassed but there was excitement and not a little desire deep within him. Mixed with his love for her, the heady feelings had his mind racing. Before he knew it he was fantasising about his beautiful mother in ways he hadn't since early puberty. He felt a dreadful pang of guilt. Here he was, sitting next to his lovely sleeping girlfriend, who not three hours ago gave him her virginity and pronounced her love for him, he was unfaithfully fantasising about his mother. His own damned mother. 

<I>Sickening, </I>Chris berated himself.

<I>Not our mother, </I>the dragon poked in his mind. <I>She is a beautiful, ripe, female who loves us. She deserves our care and attention. She raised us as her own, take her as our own.

Shut up! I love Annabel. </I>Chris retorted, angry that his mind didn't entirely disagree with his dragon. He knew the dragon wouldn't pass up an opportunity to have Susan for his own, to become part of his 'brood'.

<I>Do not resist our own nature. We love them both, we will have them both. </I>His dragon stated this as if pronouncing the inevitable. Chris didn't reply, not wanting to lose any more ground against his reptilian adversary. 

Instead he cuddled up behind Annabel, pulling her to him and breathing into her pale neck. Annabel woke as he pulled her against him, stirring with a contented murmur. Things came rushing back in a moment and she turned to confirm that she was indeed in bed with a dragon. She looked into the purple visage of her beautiful monster boyfriend, smiling with love as his vertical pupils scanned her face. 

"Hey babe." She turned her body to face his and snuggled in close, feeling he was clothed.

Chris saw love written all over her angelic, sleepy face. Overwhelmed, a tear rolled over his flat snout. Annabel quickly craned upward to kiss it away, instantly feeling a flash of his feelings in the moment the tear was shed. Deep love and appreciation.

"I love you too," Annabel said as she recovered from the startling experience, all of a sudden it felt like her body was humming with vigour. Like she had drunk 3 cups of coffee and they hit all at the same time.

"Dee, I..." Chris started, "This is so much bigger than I ever considered. Are you okay?"

"Yes doofus, I'm great! That thing with the pheromones was a little weird but also pretty frik'n hot. I can still feel it, you smell great and it makes me feel frisky," Annabel replied enthusiastically, taking another sniff at his neck before continuing. "But it's not all-consuming like before. Ooh, it was so good Chris! I never imagined sex like that. I can still feel you're stuff inside me, all slippery and tingly. Wait, do I need to worry about protection?" Annabel gushed, giddily high on love, great sex, and a powerful dose of dragon spunk.

"I guess I was asking more emotionally, rather than physically but I'm glad you enjoyed it so much. I know I did." Chris felt better, at least she seemed to be adjusting better than he was. Leaning forward to kiss her slowly, their lips pressed lightly together for a few long seconds before he pulled back to continue. "I don't think you'll get pregnant, not yet anyway, my dragon says I need to bite you first. I have a venom to induce fertility, it's all some elaborate mechanism to ensure females get pregnant with my young rather than another males."

"So weird," Annabel smiled. "So I'll stop taking the pill, just don't bite me, okay?" 

Chris tensed a little, the thought of Annabel pregnant seemed highly appealing to his dragon but come on, he was only 19. "Yeah, we don't want kids right?" He asked, smiling nervously, not wanting to say something accidentally offensive.

"Eventually, we do." Annabel replied, pleased to see the silly smile had returned to her love's face, albeit a sharper, pointier-toothed smile than she was used to. "Look Chris, don't feel too guilty about any of this. I love you, and even if you think it's some sort of magical influence you have over me I wouldn't change it. Remember I decided to go ahead with you before I found out you were a dragon." As she spoke she reached up to cup his purple cheek affectionately, trying to get her message through to him because she could tell he still had reservations. "I never dreamed any of this was possible, but in a way it's like a fantasy come true. We're going to get to explore a whole new word together."

"You might not think it's so great once we start exploring." Chris said, eyes locked with her deep browns.

"Maybe, but we'll have each other." Annabel admitted, patting his cheek and giving him a quick kiss. "Okay, let's go downstairs, I can hear Susan. How did that go?"

"Pheromones," Chris mumbled.

Annabel let out a peal of beautiful laughter, imagining Susan getting awkwardly flustered.

"It's not funny, Dee." Chris sulked.

"Oh Chris, it's a little funny," she soothed.

"My dragon. I don't know if...." He stopped, not really knowing what to say. "He ... I'm not a monogamous beast."

Annabel thought seriously for a moment, considering how she felt about this piece of news. Jealousy and anger flared in her chest before she reined those feelings in; he hadn't done anything, just tried to explain himself to her. Maybe it was his nature ... but she was his first; she loved him and he'd better damned well respect that. On the other hand ... if that was truly part of what he was, she might have to learn to live with that, or ... give him up entirely.

"We'll cross that bridge when we come to it Chris," she said honestly. 

Her response was not what Chris had expected. 

"Okay, let me get up." 

Chris watched her pull her dress back on, and told her about his adventure into the Ether, trying to explain what little he knew. Explaining how Jethry and Susan thought he was a powerful Being, come to kidnap himself.

She listened carefully as she cleaned herself up with some of Chris' bedside tissues, unashamedly letting Chris see the fruits of his labour as she wiped away her own fluids and what little of his drying cum had escaped her. Her mind swerved between the sensations as she dressed, and his talk. <I>Sore and sticky ... </I>somehow, these sensations gave her a proud thrill, some extra confidence in her own womanhood. Considering his human and dragon sides as he talked, she realised that she could modify her behaviour to appeal to either or both, precipitating a certain outcome. It wasn't as devious as all that though. She simply wanted to understand his world so she could comment intelligently in the future, remain relevant to him. 

Annabel induced him to rise up off of the bed, still wondering at his strange beauty, and gave him a loving hug before pulling her reluctant boyfriend toward the door. Walking gingerly down the hall, she felt a constant reminder of their recent activities. He had really done a number on her, attested by the tiny yet insistent aches all through her core and a general throbbing throughout. When combined with the aftermath of several huge orgasms and a light nap, though, Annabel felt just great. Everything looked golden. Stopping at the bathroom, she went in to pee. Chris waited nervously by the door reluctant to go downstairs and face his mom again, but realising it was entirely necessary.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
Once downstairs, Annabel led Chris to the kitchen bar stools. Susan looked up from her salad preparation, eyeing at Chris for a moment before turning to Annabel with a huge smile. 

"And what do you have to say for yourself, Missy?" Susan joked, noticing the flush and contentment of a well-fucked woman.

"No regrets, it was simply amazing." Annabel replied with a huge grin. "He's being all bashful and sulky now but it was so much better than I could have imagined, and once he transformed? Oh. My. God!" 

Susan cocked an eyebrow, theatrical astonishment on her face. However, she familiar with the rumours surrounding the sexual prowess of dragons.

Chris's purple face darkened to an almost midnight blue and he made a move to get up and escape from the teasing she-devils. His mother and girlfriend got on far too well together, nothing good could come of it.

"Babe I'm just teasing," Annabel said, holding him down and giving him a quick consolation kiss before turning back to Susan, "... but not really."

"Well I'm very happy for you two; however, your awakening will require quite drastic changes. How much have you told her about yourself and our world?" Susan asked her blushing son.

"He's told me what matters I think," Annabel responded for him. "I'm staying with him no matter what, we'll work the rest out as we go."

"I'm glad you feel that way Annabel, I would hate to have him newly-awakened as well as heartbroken." Susan smiled, "Just remember, this world is far from a fairytale."

"He's definitely fairytale," Annabel couldn't stop herself and Susan could only laugh at her flustered son.

"Enough," Chris pleaded, "No more, I might literally die."

"Poor boy, we've barely started. Okay, tell me what happened, you can leave out the gruesome details to save my son's fragile ego." Susan smirked. 

Annabel started to explain the events of the day, beginning with their confession of love at school. She almost teared up a bit so Chris continued, describing his transformation. Susan asked a few questions and gave answers to their queries where she could. She finished the salad and fried two large steaks. Soon dinner was served and they sat together at the kitchen bar, Chris eating one steak with Annabel and Susan split the other. While salad didn't much appeal to Chris, on the other hand his new teeth demolished the steak.

"So what happens tomorrow?" Chris asked between mouthfuls.

"Well," Susan said thoughtfully, "we'll all leave first thing tomorrow and seek an audience with Lady Narlakis. I don't imagine we'll have to wait long, given the importance of a new male dragon. Once we have her approval and get you registered, I think you'll have to make Annabel your Familiar right away. From there I don't actually know...." She pondered for a few moments. "We'll probably get a guard and stay in Denver a few days. What are you going to tell your parents Annabel?"

"I'll call them tonight and tell them I'm going on a trip with you guys, to check out Denver for the autumn," Annabel said. "If they kick up a fuss I'll just say I'm moving out. I will be, anyway."

They ate a little more, listening to Susan retell how terrified she had been when she'd gotten Jethry's call that afternoon; how she had assumed the worst when she got home and felt the presence of a powerful unknown Being.

"So how powerful is he?" Annabel asked.

"In terms of raw potential, I don't think I've been this close to anyone more powerful. He feels like a Class 1, the highest class before you break out of the class scale. Chris, you have such as strong presence it's scary. The bleed-through from the Ether was downright impressive, and now that you're in the Norm it's almost smothering. We will have to work on teaching you how to dampen your aura," Susan mused. "As for actual power? I don't know. I'd say your inexperience is your biggest vulnerability, but strangers won't know about that. After a couple years' training I think you'll be able to tackle pretty much whatever this world can throw at you." Susan was almost bubbling over with pride.

"Wow," Annabel teased, "I bagged a prize catch!" 

Chris didn't rise to the bait; instead, he just continued eating his steak.... Payback for her teasing would come eventually.

"More than you might realise, Annabel." Susan said seriously. "You are going to have some fierce competition, and the contestants aren't going to play fair. Male dragons are considered superlative mates amongst Beings. Funnily enough the females have a reputation of being ice queens, but that's mostly because they're wired to expect greatness from their males. Chris, I imagine you'll be pressured to find at least one dragon mate, you have a species to save after all."

"What about you, Susan?" Annabel asked, a little steel in her tone as she considered her potential competition. "Chris told me about his effect on you."

Chris froze, his fork midway to his mouth. His dragon, too, was watching them intently; it was important that he understood the dynamics inside his own brood.

"I'm not really his mother you know. I'll resist it but I guess we'll cross that bridge if we come to it," Susan replied, inwardly impressed. She felt reluctant admiration for Annabel who was already on the defence, playing for keeps.

"That's what I said." Annabel said, giving Susan a smile and allowing the heat of competition to cool for the moment.

Chris opened his mouth and let his fork resume its steak-laden path, his dragon mulling over this new information. It appeared Annabel had some inner fire, which was an immensely pleasing revelation. <I>She would make an excellent first, helping him to manage the rest of his females. </I>Disturbed with his dragon's train of thought, Chris stood up quietly and beat a hasty retreat. He walked into the living room, found his chair without turning on a light in the evening gloom, and sat down to think.

Susan's voice carried from the kitchen, where she was telling Annabel to give him a little space. However, a minute later his stunning girlfriend waltzed into the darkened room and planted herself in his lap, affectionately kissing his cheek before snuggling against his warm chest. Chris wrapped his arms around her and held on tight.

"What's up?" Annabel asked after a minute.

Chris sighed, "Just trying to come to terms with all this. My dragon thinks so differently from what I feel should be acceptable. Like just before, he was watching to see which of you would be in charge of the rest of his females, including Susan. She already belongs to him in his mind."

"If that's what you really need from me, I'll do it." Annabel consoled.

"I don't want that for you, Annabel. Damn it, I feel like a fucking schizo. Like there's me and some douchebag trapped inside my head, and he keeps winning all the arguments. I guess we just cross that bridge if we come to it," Chris confided, exasperated, but at the same time glad she wasn't repulsed by his nature.

"Shhhh," Annabel squeezed him tight around his smooth, scaly abdomen. "That's what I said," she repeated quietly.

After a few minutes Susan called them back for chocolate ice cream. She observed the dynamics between them. Chris guided Annabel back into the room, his claw-tipped hand on her lower back. Annabel sat on his lap, the mechanics of which were a little awkward at first. With his insidiously intoxicating scent tickling her nostrils, she felt a twinge of jealousy as Annabel cuddled up to her son; and knew she was in trouble.

"Chris...." Susan started, deciding to get things in the open now before it became more awkward. "I love you. I'm your mother but you've changed, so whatever happens, there will be no more guilty feelings. As a woman I find you incredibly desirable, you were tempting enough before you awakened; but now ... now you're a different person. You will be with others besides Annabel, it can't be helped. Now I'm not necessarily setting my sights on you, but I won't spite myself from missing out on happiness out of a misplaced sense of moral wrongness, which doesn't actually apply to our situation at all. Think about that."

Chris met Susan's blue eyes straight on as she spoke; had he been made to respond to her, human to human, he would have died of embarrassment. Saved by his dragon who now took over, instead he appraised the raven-haired, mature beauty before him. "I have, and I agree." He allowed a small grin to grow a little wider as he continued to size her up with his rather piercing stare. Sniffing the air, the dragon savoured the scents of his two women, before relinquishing control back to his human side.

Susan, squirmed on her seat slightly knowing that the dragon had scented her. The pull to go to him was strong but she held back, refraining even from a chaste embrace. It was too soon.... Chris needed time to adjust to his new life. Instead, she made quick work of her ice-cream and excused herself, reminding the cuddling lovers to be ready by 7 am the next morning.

Susan quickly made for her ensuite bathroom, stripping hastily and examining herself in the mirror, considering her body. She was pleased with what she saw, aging slower than a non magical human, her generous, slightly pointy breasts had only a little sag, large nipples slightly high and currently very erect. Her belly was only slightly padded and her waist still tapering, flaring to very womanly hips and thick, luscious thighs. She was only 38 after all.

Exploring herself gently, it wasn't long before she was caught up in little snippets of fantasy centred around her son, stopping every now and then to chastise herself. She considered her thick pelt of dark pubic hair, wondering if he would prefer her shaven ... that was all the craze among the youth these days, wasn't it? She hadn't felt anything but her own touch since just before this exile started almost 15 years ago, always afraid that getting involved with someone would expose Chris somehow. Now her unkempt bush was moist and steamy, wicking up the moisture from her fevered pussy. She decided to leave it; he would know he was with a real, full bodied, sexy woman when they finally acted on their desires.

In the shower, she cleaned the day's stresses away but soon relented to some exquisite self gratification, dreaming the dragon in the house below barged into her bathroom and had his strong, loving, yet firm way with her. With a strangled little scream, Susan experienced the most powerful orgasm she could remember, slick channel clenching desperately around her single finger. She collapsed down the wall she was leaning on with a wail, warm water flowing over her body, washing away her creamy juices. For a full minute Susan sat on the floor with her legs stretched wide, her finger as deep as she could manage while she twitched with little shocks of joy, never considering that the subject of her desires now had powerful hearing. Finally she pulled herself together, not a little guiltily and got ready for bed, setting her alarm early in order to get ready for their trip.

***

Chris heard Susan's orgasm from the kitchen despite the noise of the shower. Her noises had an unmistakable tone of pleasure that stirred him to hardness in moments, nestled under Annabel's firm butt.

"I don't know if I can handle any more of that just now, babe," Annabel said teasingly, putting a little pout into her tone. "I'm a bit sore after how roughly it treated me."

"I'm sorry, I was a bit rough the second time wasn't I?" Chris apologised.

"Maybe, but it was also fantastic," she admitted with a yawn, wrapping her arms up around his neck. "Take me to bed, I'm tired again."

Chris obliged, happy to hold her close and carry her to his room, his hands firmly planted on her fleshy ass. Annabel wrapped her legs around him. It was a major turn on that he carried her around so easily. They cleaned their teeth using his toothbrush and got ready for bed. Together they stripped and curled up in bed, Chris spooned behind her, caressing along her soft tummy up to her breasts. 

"Are you ever going to change back?" Annabel asked, "Aren't your wings annoying in bed?"

Chris reached behind himself, turning out the lights. "I know I can change fully back into a human, I just don't know how. I guess my dragon will help with that when I need to." He moved his wings around experimentally, trying to figure out how sleeping like this would work. It didn't seem too uncomfortable. "I think the wings will be fine, I'll try to avoid sleeping on my back though. I'm more worried about how I'm going to get to sleep next to these." He reached up to cup a small breast, holding her tiny nipple hostage between his fingers, rolling it gently between finger and thumb.

"Hands off the tits, neither of us will get to sleep at this rate. Besides there isn't much to hold your attention for long." Annabel sighed, squirming a little. She didn't really want to get too fired up and end up not getting any sleep.

"They're beautiful, perky, cute, sweet, and perfect," Chris whispered into her ear, "just like their owner." He really did love her little tits, he could appreciate a busty woman but Annabel's were perfect for her. They even had their own equally small areolas with matching tiny nipples, perfect for him to fit half a breast in his mouth.

"Thanks babe," she replied, turning her head to give him a brief awkward kiss. "I love you," she said, nestling back into his warm body.

"And I love your tits, Dee," came his quiet reply, not relinquishing her boob. 

"You're a dork," she muttered, her breathing eventually slowed as she fell asleep.

Chris lay awake for a while longer, mulling things over and trying to ignore his penis pressed against her soft rear. Tomorrow he would be forced into the deep water of this new world. He had no plan ... other than swim hard ... and avoid sharks.

The alarm came too soon, jarring them from sleep. Chris smacked the off-switch with a groan. They lay spooned together, a sleepy Annabel cuddling back into his warmth to capture a few more moments of bliss. Just before succumbing again to sleep, Chris roused himself. He switched on the lamp and got up to look for a pair of track pants and then head to the bathroom. 

His morning wood hadn't subsided as yet, so he had to manage his flow carefully while he aimed; furthermore, it felt strange peeing with an unfamiliar penis. In its half-form, the head was more pointed, and the sensitive ridge where the shaft met the broad crown much more pronounced. Combined, these features made it almost look like a thick, cartoon-styled arrowhead. His hairlessness was something else as well, he mused. It made sense, since his body was now covered in micro scales.

Finished, he gave a great full stretch, flexing and then rubbing sleep away from his eyes, until he felt a thump.... One of his outstretched wings had hit the wall. Retracting the errant appendage, he started the shower. 

Annabel sauntered into the bathroom. Naked. Without preamble, she sat down to pee. &quot;What?&quot; she asked.

&quot;So we're just doing this now?&quot; Chris gestured between them mutely: him entering the shower, her peeing unashamedly.

&quot;Yeah. I think we're at that stage.&quot; She smiled, finished up, and flushed. &quot;Hurry up and get in already, I'm cold.&quot;

She pushed him into the shower, guiding his awkward wings through the door and followed behind. They hadn't showered together before, but she had had some inspiring fantasies. So before he could make any further fuss she grabbed the soap and began lathering his broad, cream-colored chest. Washing down his arms and sides, she noted the transition between his purple and ivory colours, as well as the new textures of his micro-scaled skin. Chris spoke nary a word; her hands felt exquisite running over his body, and in combination with the flow of hot water, he was in heaven. She looked up at him for approval every now and then; but he only ever had a broad, toothy smile on his face.

Done with the top half, she coaxed him to kneel so she could wash his face and hair. Then she knelt down behind him and soaped up his wings and the larger scales along his spine. It ended up taking a good bit of time, including a brief debacle when she had started to wash his ass. Her touch had been electrifying, making him jump and twitch a little, during which his right wing had bumped the temperature control. Finally order resumed inside the cramped space, and yet it remained unclear as to whether they, or the shower box, came out on top. Giggling, she reached around to lather his crotch. He was massively hard. She, too, found herself increasingly excited as she stroked his soap-slicked penis for a few minutes, under the guise of ensuring cleanliness. <i>God he's nice and big,</i> she thought as her hand struggled to encircle him. <i>I'd better not tease him though.</i> In truth she was still sore from yesterday.

Chris, now panting with pleasure, rested his forehead against the glass wall as water dripped down his face. She stroked him expertly, her body pressed up against his back. Suddenly she stopped. Gripping just behind his crown for a moment, in a firm squeeze goodbye, she let go in order to worm around him until they knelt face-to-face. 

On their knees facing each other in the steam and spray, Annabel leaned up to kiss him: a vision of wet, innocent sensuality, eyes closed against the pattering water. Timidly at first, her tongue ventured for the first time into his dangerously sharp mouth, until she realised her trepidation was unfounded. He would never hurt her, so she took a little time to familiarise herself with his newly sharp teeth, especially his short fangs. 

&quot;Wash me,&quot; she sweetly pleaded.

He took hold of the soap. Looking down at her slick beauty, he paused. Where to start? There was an expectant, almost vulnerable look in her large brown eyes, so he just went for it. Progressing down her arms, he used the rougher pads of his fingers and palms, careful not to mar her soft skin with his talons. She sighed as he caressed her, took care of her, noting the caution he took not to touch her with his claws. Then again she almost wished he wouldn't be so careful; she wouldn't break. After all, the tickle or scratch of a lightly applied talon might hold its own pleasure, mightn't it?

He had been hovering on the edge after her soapy hand job; now touching Annabel so intimately , listening to her contented little noises, set his heart ablaze ... and his cock on fire, poking her belly. He leaned down closer to wash over her pert little breasts, ignoring the temptation to tweak a tiny brown nipple. Down over her soft, flat tummy and over her thighs and legs, he avoided her crotch for the moment before pulling her close and reaching behind her to wash her back. As he skimmed her firm, peachy ass, soap in hand, she reached down to his pointed cock and rubbed it against her abdomen.

Gasping in her ear, Chris reciprocated by soaping her crack, touching her delicate anus very intimately for a moment before reaching further around to her puffy lips. Kneeling between her spread legs, Chris had direct access to her slick pussy as he reached all the way around behind her, the soap only replacing her own plentiful lubrication. He explored the plump curve of her labia, the tender frills of her inner lips only just peeking out until he ran a finger along to spread them. She was panting against his neck as he gently rubbed her most intimate area from behind, rocking slightly back and forth against his hand. After only a minute or so of this he felt her pleasure rising, Chris made a final lunge for her clitoris, pushing it down firmly for a second then rubbing his finger back and forth rapidly, stimulating her soap-lathered petals at the same time. 

Annabel came with a muffled squeak and a tiny gush of cum on his hand. Chris held still as she rode it out, his hand firmly cupping her quivering pussy as the rest of her body gently undulated and shook. Once she had recovered a bit he began shampooing her dark hair while she rested against his chest, breathing heavily. Rinsing her and applying conditioner, he pampered Annabel with a brief scalp massage before washing it away too, leaving her silky hair clinging to her neck and down her back.

A post orgasmic scalp massage was truly a mind altering experience for Annabel, the kind of treatment that could not go unrewarded. &quot;Get up,&quot; she said quietly, urging Chris to stand. It was awkward but soon enough he was standing and she straightened her back to come face-to-face with his pulsing, erect member.

Hands on his beefy purple thighs, she leaned in under the spray and kissed his pointed tip, teasing the very edge between her lips. Leaving it for a moment she kissed down one side, sucking and licking, she crossed underneath, kissing each of his big purple orbs briefly. They didn't seem to dangle or swing, rather they were held close against his thick root. Soon she started back up the other side, dreadfully slowly. She kept her eyes closed this time because water was splashing in her face but his groan as she opened wide and stretched her lips over the large head told her all she needed to know, that he was very close. Stroking and pumping with her hands on his shaft, she took as much of him as she could manage, holding him there in her mouth as her hands worked on the rest. Pulling back, she locked her lips behind the enlarged ridge of his crown, bathing it with her hot tongue before applying almost brutal suction.

That was all it took. Chris hissed through his teeth, bucking his hips forward slightly while he steadied himself against the wall. Her eyes shot open, blinking away the water. His purple testicles pulled up and loosed a huge spurt down his shaft, hitting the back of her throat before she could taste it. Helplessly, he groaned, fucking her pretty mouth a little as it sucked the life out of him, releasing four more jets of cum before he trailed off with smaller spurts and dribbles. 

She fell into another, milder orgasm instantly. His taste was salty but thick with his spicy, sweet essence. The potent, magical aphrodisiac of his cum kept her orgasm alive as he emptied himself into her hungry mouth. His cum was much thicker and stickier than she remembered, clinging to the roof of her mouth like too much Nutella. She ended up having to work at it with her tongue, astounded but unable to communicate her surprise in anything but lusty moans around her mouthful. As she swallowed, her body began to subtly tingle with vigour and energy.

As their orgasms abated, Annabel held his sensitised penis captive in her mouth for a few more seconds before sucking powerfully and pulling her head back. The pressure made Chris growl as a last little trickle of cum was released. Annabel's lips came away, and she looked up, smiling.

For several seconds they stared at each other, Chris towering over her, sheltering her from the stream of water. 

&quot;Chris, what is your stuff made of?&quot;

&quot;Well, it's – &quot; he had started to explain, a little nervously.

&quot;As soon as it hit my tongue it set me off again. You're a monster! And god damn, it's still stuck in my mouth.&quot; She giggled, giving his flagging penis a playful nuzzle, &quot;How does the accused respond?&quot;

&quot;I can confirm that my semen is perhaps a powerful aphrodisiac but I vehemently deny all other accusations,&quot; he responded with mock seriousness. &quot;Susan says that's part of the reason dragons are endangered; our bodies possess so much magical energy that it's too great a temptation. Other Beings want to get some for their own. When a dragon resists, some resort to force. Eventually it has degraded into dragon hunting that has lasted for centuries. It was widely accepted; the Synod seemed to ignore the issue until we became gravely endangered. Even now, Susan says, someone might still think they could get away with taking a dragon, or that the benefits outweigh the risk.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; How could people hunt something to extinction just to have something they could go without quite easily? She didn't want to get bogged down just then, though, so she tried to lighten the subject. &quot;So your jizz makes me cream myself all over again, which by the way, I'm completely on board with. What else do you have hiding up your sleeve?&quot; Rising, she pressed her face into his neck, not quite tall enough to kiss him in his new form unless he leaned for her. She inhaled deeply, catching his delicious smell at the source and teasing his soft skin with kisses, not even able to discern his tiny scales with her tongue as she explored the firm muscles connecting to his shoulder.

Chris enjoyed her ministration for a moment before replying, Annabel felt his throat vibrate as he spoke, quirkily finding the vibrations of his speech satisfying against her face.

&quot;I have two kinds of venom, one is a deadly poison.&quot; Chris spoke tentatively, holding her close, waiting for what he felt was the inevitable snap when she would run from him screaming. &quot;The other induces fertility. My dragon thinks it can be somewhat addictive.&quot;

&quot;Keep all your girls coming back for more, huh? Just how many horses do you need in your stable Chris?&quot; she asked, only half-teasing.

&quot;Dee, I'm sorry,&quot; he whispered, squeezing her slick nakedness in a tight hug.

&quot;Shhhhh, I didn't mean it like that, I know you love me.&quot; She changed the subject. &quot;What about that poison?&quot; 

&quot;I do Annabel, so much.&quot; He held her tight. After a while he lightened his grip, stroking her back under the water with his face nestled in her wet hair. &quot;The poison is deadly to most Beings, within minutes or hours, depending on how much is injected. My saliva can neutralise it and also induce rapid healing of wounds.&quot;

&quot;Chris, you're a really big deal aren't you? I mean shit, you have all these powers, are you like a celebrity or something? Are people really going to try to hurt you?&quot;

&quot;I'll try my hardest to not let that happen, but yes, I think any dragon is generally considered a 'big deal'. It isn't a good thing, Dee. How am I supposed to be myself if humans get dragon-struck around me? What am I supposed to do if vampires proposition or even stalk me because I taste the best? I'm still just some small-town farm dude. I want to hang out with you, play video games, mess around, find a job I enjoy, and maybe amass a small pile of valuable metals. Okay, so that last one is mostly dragon-driven but you get the picture, right? I'm still just me underneath everything else.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I think I understand.... Oh my god, do vampires sparkle?&quot; she teased in a false excited voice, slapping his chest.

Chris sighed. &quot;No. I haven't ever met one, but they stick more to the traditional legends. The powerful ones can come out in the day, by magic.&quot;

&quot;Cool.&quot; Briefly, she wondered how even the powerful ones could manage eluding the sun's affects. &quot;Seriously though, I know you're still my old boyfriend, wrapped up in a sexy new body. It just hit me all of a sudden how much of a change this is. I guess before I hadn't really thought about it too hard, but it doesn't actually change anything. I'm with you all the way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Annabel, it means so much to me.&quot; He paused. &quot;So, you think I'm sexy like this huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she giggled, wriggling against him sensually. &quot;You're all strong and purple and scaly.... Wait what am I saying; you're disgusting! No stupid, you're hot, it's like you call to me somehow, you're everything I'll ever want.&quot;

&quot;Thanks babe. Okay, we had better get out.&quot;

&quot;Alright, but remember, you and I shower together from now on, and I'll expect just as much pampering.&quot; 

&quot;Be careful what you ask for,&quot; he teased, switching off the water and extracting himself from the confines of the shower. She gave him a spank as she followed him out, so he tickled her into a wet, giggly mess before drying her off lovingly. After drying himself, he got her to help with his wings and they headed back to his room.

They had spent too long in the shower and there was a rush to get dressed. Annabel slipped into her dress from yesterday, with one of Chris's jumpers over the top for warmth. Chris threw on a pair of jeans and then turned his attention to his footwear; his taloned toes were a nightmare to get socks onto, but only somewhat uncomfortable once inside his boots. He ripped the back off of an old T-shirt, after which Annabel re-attached the ripped section to accommodate his wings, with a few safety pins.

He packed a few days' clothes in a bag along with toiletries, cell phone and charger, and the entirety of his stash. Annabel's eyes widened at seeing so many small bags of nuggets and gold dust, along with several holographic ounce kinebars. She'd accompanied him on a couple of day-long trips, immersing herself in a book while he splashed around in a freezing stream. She hadn't actually comprehended his success, thinking of it as simply a quirky hobby. Once over her initial surprise, she resumed applying vanilla-scented perfume and her favourite pink lip gloss. 

The young couple headed downstairs hand in hand, and into the kitchen where they could hear Susan starting breakfast. Chris realised he had forgotten their morning coffee ritual, and greeted his Mom with a warm hug and an apology. 

Susan had expected him to be standoffish after last night but she could see that he was determined not to let his awakening ruin their closeness. She couldn't help but laugh at the makeshift solution for his t-shirts, promising to find a better solution. There were other winged Beings, after all. In truth, the Being before her was the picture of rugged, powerful, maleness. Devastatingly exotic, dangerous, and handsome, yet unaware of his charms; his unpretentiousness made him all the more adorable.

Excusing himself as the two women chatted about the trip, Chris made his way outside, down and across the field to the milking shed. The sun had risen fully. His dragon's senses detected life and vigour all around him. Soon he would be living in Denver, away from the quiet countryside in which he had grown up. Approaching the milking shed cautiously, he tried to be as unthreatening as possible, projecting peaceful thoughts to the cows inside. Only a slight fuss was made when he entered; perhaps the peaceful thoughts helped, or perhaps the animals still recognised him as the one who had taken care of them for years. 

Jethry was washing a cow's udder in preparation for the milking cups when he felt Chris approach. Such power in one so young scared the shit out of Jethry but he knew Chris had a kind heart, a peaceful soul. That could be a problem. Should he fall victim to controlling influences, the results could be devastating; Chris would have to learn to rely on his more savage dragon to protect him. 

They stood, and looked: two old friends taking stock of each other with new eyes. 

&quot;I don't have too much to say,&quot; Jethry started. &quot;You're powerful enough to mostly look out for yourself and smart enough to smell out any obvious trouble. I warned you against bringing the girl into this but what's done is done. Perhaps it's a good thing too, she'll help you keep in touch with your humanity. Don't lose that, don't compromise yourself.&quot;

Chris was silent, taking in his old friend's advice.

&quot;You've lead a simple life so far, too sheltered in my opinion but there are good reasons for that. You'll have protection from all but the most brutal or daring attacks, dragon hunting is illegal but you're too valuable to ignore. There will be plotters and sycophants, vying for your attention or favour so don't trust anyone.&quot;

&quot;Don't worry boy, I'm almost done,&quot; Jethry said, sensing a bit of agitation from Chris. &quot;I've seen some of the magic that can be wrought with the use of dragons. Powerful stuff. You'll get contracts for your services; I suspect the payments will seem outrageous, but remember that people won't generally offer what they can't afford. Word your contracts so they're water-tight and don't whore yourself out to make a quick buck, you'll drive the price down in the long run. Finally, protect and care for what's yours. That means Annabel and Susan. They will be your greatest strength, your trusted allies, so to speak. But they will also be your weakness if they're used to get to you. Don't let that happen. It's up to you to do the protecting now, even if Susan doesn't realise it. Well, I guess that's all.&quot;
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
&quot;Thank you Jethry. I'll keep all of that in mind, though I suspect that somehow I'll fail miserably. I'm just a ... well, I guess I'm a nerdy hick.&quot; 

&quot;Naw, you'll be fine. It's not all as grim as I made it out to be. If it's anything like my cat, just remember to trust your dragon's instincts. He'll watch out for the both of you but at the same time don't let him control you. Try to find a balance.&quot;

The conversation over, Chris strode forward to give the old werecat a heartfelt, if somewhat awkward man-hug. It felt like he was saying goodbye.

&quot;I'm proud of you Chris, good luck,&quot; came Jethry's reply as they broke apart. &quot;See ya around.&quot;

He walked back to the house, committing Jethry's advice to memory, trying to prepare for the new world.

***

Breakfast was awkward. His interlocked, very sharp teeth didn't really crush. They sliced. Utensils got in the way of his fang-like canines, transforming eating cereal – or anything else for that matter – into a frustrating experience. He was terrified he might bite off half his tongue if he ever slipped up. The women snickered at his misfortune while he tried to eat. 

They all cleaned up and loaded the car. Susan had a duffle of clothes and a small briefcase for their documents. Chris noticed that she also packed some blankets and pillows. She put the back seat down and spread out the blankets. How else had he expected to fit in the car with wings that stuck out above his already considerable height? He hadn't considered that.

Once he'd crawled in and laid down, she threw him the pillows, and spread a final blanket to cover him. From within her purse, she produced a small erlamire flask containing a greenish liquid: a chameleon potion. This she sprinkled over everything in the trunk, and, with an image of a trunk's worth of shopping bags in her mind's eye, she released her energy into the spell; suddenly the blanketed, dragon-shaped mound, resembled a small shopping spree.

&quot;That's so fucking awesome!&quot; Annabel exclaimed, running her hand through the illusion to feel Chris underneath.

&quot;What do I look like?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Shopping bags. There are groceries and some clothes store bags, some shoe boxes, and a hardware store bag too. Susan, can I learn magic?&quot; she asked hopefully.

&quot;I'm sorry Annabel, but I don't sense any magic in you. Now stay lying down Chris, it's only an illusion as long as you stay reasonably still. It does nothing for sound but that shouldn't be a problem while we're driving.&quot; She closed the trunk and walked around to the driver's side.

Somewhat dejected, Annabel climbed into the passenger seat and had just snapped the seatbelt buckle closed when she had a brilliant idea. She unbuckled and climbed in back between the seats. Susan looked back in time to get an eyeful of Annabel's bare legs and panties disappearing under the illusion as she moved next to Chris, and pulled the blanket over their heads. Soon there were contented, moist, kissy sounds emerging from the pile of shopping.

&quot;Alright, here we go,&quot; Susan said, mostly to herself. Turning the car down the drive, she waved to Jethry who stood on his porch. 

They were off.

*** 

Chris and Annabel were stuck. Having spent the drive to Laramie smooching and petting under cover of the magical illusion, they desperately wanted to move things to the next level. There were just the small problems of Susan's presence in the driver's seat, and that they were now on a relatively busy highway headed for Denver. They decided to pause instead of exciting themselves further. 

&quot;Mom, what are we actually doing when we get to Denver?&quot;

&quot;Well, now that we are actually on the road I need to call and arrange an audience with Lady Narlakis – Annabel, she's the ruler of the mid-western territory of Beings. I've avoided calling before now, in case someone came looking for us. I won't tell them who you are; just that I have an awakened Being to present and register. Once I've called – I think I'll do that in a few minutes actually – we'll drive to the Denver Compound. It's an underground complex in the city centre, underneath the Being district, the area with the most Being-oriented businesses and shops. The Compound is actually an underground palace. Lady Narlakis is a Drow, after all.&quot;

&quot;Wait, businesses? You guys are out in the open?&quot; Annabel asked incredulously.

&quot;It's our most important law that our activities don't expose our existence or raise suspicion, but yes. We are a reasonably large community and there are too many of us to live in the shadows. Every being has some sort of form which can pass for human, perhaps with the help of a little magic so we are hidden in plain sight.&quot; She paused to pass a truck before continuing. &quot;The Lady should be in session this morning, receiving requests from the community and sorting out disputes. We'll be able to present Chris, get him registered, pick up a bodyguard, get an allowance to take a familiar, and hopefully not piss anyone off.&quot;

&quot;Sounds complicated, with what Jethry said, it sounds like there are pitfalls and enemies at just about every corner,&quot; Chris worried.

&quot;In a way there are, Chris. Some people will be threatened by you, others will just want to use you without any thoughts of real malice. Just be careful.&quot; She pulled into the next rest area. &quot;Okay, let me call the Compound. I'll put it on speaker but you have to be quiet.&quot; She dialled the number. Communications of a magical nature were all encrypted by a global spell, a magical communications network: huge in cost and energy, but worth every penny in the modern world. It rang a few times before it was picked up.

&quot;Denver reception, how may I help you?&quot; came the female voice.

&quot;My name is Susan Baryst, registered witch, 4th class, Laramie.&quot; 

&quot;Yes. I have your file on screen, what can I do for you today?&quot; 

&quot;I require an audience with Lady Narlakis under urgency; I'm bringing in a recently awakened Being, suspected Class 1 or above. We'll need an escort.&quot; 

There was a pause. &quot;Class 1? Are you sure? What species? Is it dangerous?&quot; Reception's interest was piqued.

&quot;Like I said, Class 1 at least. Security is for his protection. I won't reveal any further details.&quot; 

&quot;One moment, may I call you back shortly?&quot; 

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Susan replied before disconnecting.

It only took a few minutes for them to call back.

&quot;Susan, this is Timothy Garrill, head of compound security," came a gruff male voice. "You will have a priority audience as soon as you arrive. Lady Narlakis will be in court all morning so you will be inserted into the schedule when you get here. Head to the bottom floor of the underground parking building; there you will be met by a security team and escorted into court. I understand you won't reveal the species or identity of the Being, therefore you will be held responsible for his actions should things turn sour. Is this acceptable?&quot;

&quot;Accepted. I expect to arrive in about an hour.&quot; Once Susan had responded, the line went dead.

&quot;Wow, they don't muck around,&quot; Annabel commented in the silence after the phone call, now she was actually scared.

&quot;They're not always this serious, but a Class 1 is a big deal. It'll be fine Annabel, just don't say a word. Chris or I will do the talking.&quot; Susan reassured. &quot;Chris, you'll have to swear to uphold our laws and loyalty to Lady Narlakis. She can be a bit eccentric but she's generally fair, just be polite and don't offend her, try a little flattery if you can. She will be your protector and provider for years to come, you should behave appropriately thankful. However, she is a notorious collector, just like you collect treasure Chris, she collects valuable and loyal Beings. It's part of the reason she's so powerful. All going well, a young dragon will be such a tempting prize she will bend over backward to make sure we get everything we need.&quot; 

Underneath the blanket, Chris pulled Annabel close into a hug.

***

The rest of the drive sped by in silence, an hour passing as if it were only a few minutes. 

&quot;Here we go.&quot; They pulled into the underground car park of a mid-rise building. As they wound down three levels to the bottom floor, Susan briefed them. &quot;I'll get out first and open the trunk. Chris gets out, Annabel stay under the blanket until the initial meeting is over. Chris will help you out.&quot;

She pulled up to the security checkpoint. Their escort was already there: five Beings in dark clothes fanned out around the car as they parked. Susan got out first.

&quot;Be brave, I love you.&quot; Annabel was trembling as Chris whispered to her before the trunk opened, the outside conversation becoming clear to the two inside. 

&quot;You can feel him can't you?&quot; Susan asked. &quot;He won't be dangerous unless provoked.&quot;

&quot;Yes, he's a big fella,&quot; came the voice of Timothy Garrill. Bringing in a Class 1 was something the fire elemental would see to, himself. &quot;Okay, bring him out slowly." He then spoke in a low curt growl, he meant business. "If you'd told us what he is we could have prepared better, witch.&quot;

&quot;Okay Chris, you heard him,&quot; came Susan's voice.

Chris's heart pounded as he slid out from underneath the blanket. With his feet planted on the concrete floor, he pulled aside his section of the blanket and slowly straightened, raising to his full height. Taking in his surroundings in a flash, his tongue flicked out to taste the air. Elemental, vampire, lycan, wizard, witch, his dragon informed him.

&quot;Holy shit,&quot; Timothy started. &quot;He's a dragon, right? Who the hell is he? They're all under protection.&quot;

Chris stayed still, trying not to seem threatening as he assessed the security team. The vampire woman and the male lycan were scenting him in return. &quot;Yes, he's a dragon. I've raised him as my son. His name is Chris.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you Chris, it's an honour. I'm Timothy Garril.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Chris shook Timothy's offered hand firmly. &quot;May I bring out Annabel now?&quot; he asked as he turned back toward Susan. 

The attack came lightning-fast from behind; the vampire was on his back, attempting to sink her fangs into his neck, driven by the scent of his powerful blood. His dragon jolted into action, buffeting the woman with his wings as he snarled and reached behind to pull her off by her hair. Firming up his hold with a grip on her neck, he ripped her off his back, her scrabbling black talons ripping his shirt and scratching across his scales, drawing a little blood. The smell of his blood in the air only made her struggle harder but Chris had her, slamming her down on the ground and holding her there by her pale neck, applying pressure as she struggled and hissed, fangs bared. 

The others sprang into action, moving forward, intent on pulling the two apart. 

&quot;Stop!&quot; Annabel screamed, hearing the fight and pushing aside the blanket. &quot;Don't hurt him, please!&quot;

The security team held off and looked to their leader, startled by her sudden appearance. 

Chris's dragon was in a rage. It wanted to kill the vampire, and pressed down, as if to rip her head off. She let out a wail, bloodlust fading as self-preservation became more pressing. 

&quot;Please let her go, Chris.&quot; Annabel begged quietly. 

His face snapped up in her direction, a feral snarl fading as he saw his girlfriend, terrified and confused. Looking back down at the vampire, he brought his human side into control, carefully releasing his grip on the woman's neck, then turning to take Annabel in his arms and walk a few paces away. &quot;Get her away from me,&quot; he snarled over his shoulder.

There was a kafuffle of action as they checked on their teammate and restrained her. The vampire, Amanda, was dazed and sore; her neck and the back of her head ached horribly, but she would heal. Mostly she felt shame. She had attacked a newborn dragon in a fit of bloodlust. Even now she could smell his blood; if she hadn't felt so thoroughly beaten she would have been up and at him again in a heartbeat ... not that she had one.

&quot;How dare you!&quot; screamed an outraged Susan. They hadn't even made it inside before her son had been attacked! This wasn't a good start.

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; As his team saw to Amanda, Timothy tried to soothe Susan, blocking her from moving toward the prone vampire. &quot;We didn't know he was a dragon, we would have made her feed beforehand if we did.&quot;

&quot;That's no excuse!&quot; Susan spat.

&quot;Perhaps not,&quot; replied the elemental, &quot;she'll be punished. Now let's get everyone calmed down and move on; you have an audience with Lady Narlakis. Who's the human?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that's Chris's girlfriend. She'll become his familiar once it's approved.&quot; Susan calmed down; she needed to be collected for their court appearance.

&quot;That isn't strictly procedure, Susan. She clearly knows about us and is under no binding not to reveal us,&quot; he stated, a little worried about how this new wrinkle might play out with Lady Narlakis.

&quot;You're going to argue procedure with me after what just happened?&quot; Susan raised an eyebrow at the head of security. By now the other three had Amanda up on her feet, leading her toward the door. As she passed Chris, she muttered out the best apology she could.

Chris grunted in reply. 

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Annabel asked from within his hug.

&quot;She's a vampire, she mustn't have been able to control herself and she tried to bite me.&quot; His dragon found the whole thing exciting. Chris found it terrifying; he had been moments away from killing another Being.

&quot;Oh my god Chris, I didn't see that part. When I saw you, you had her by the throat on the ground. I was so scared.&quot; Annabel shivered. 

&quot;I'm sorry Dee, my dragon kind of took over when she jumped on me. Thanks for calming me down.&quot; He kissed her hair. 

Timothy came over shortly after and apologised to Chris for Amanda's behaviour. Chris accepted the apology and for some reason asked that she be shown leniency. Timothy readily agreed. Amanda would likely punish herself thoroughly on top of whatever he dreamed up for her. He called in an increased security order for the compound and court chamber as well as clearing their path to the court.

They began the ascent from the parking garage toward the court, walking down empty halls that led through a mix of modern and ancient interiors; the underground had been expanded and modified over many decades. Annabel and Chris walked hand in hand, flanked by their escort, while Susan brought up the rear. 

***

Sitting, sore and forlorn in the security office, awaiting her punishment, Amanda berated herself. Was she nothing but a bloodsucking monster? The first 50 years as a vampire had truly been hard but she had gotten through them, and in the process had learned to control her thirst. But her first whiff of dragon flesh had been enough to set off her most basic instincts. Disgusted, she looked down at the smears of red that remained on her hands. Before even thinking, a finger was in her mouth, sucked spotless in an instant as the flavours exploded against her tongue. With a moan, the rest of her fingers were dutifully bathed, lapping up every delectable molecule of his blood. She let out a whimper of despair as his taste faded, leaving her terribly unsatisfied, and having ruined her appetite for any other blood. She had gone about this all wrong: she should have offered herself to him, begged if necessary, to let her feed from him. She had to have more.

***

They waited outside the door to the court chamber while the current session finished. It didn't take long before a lycan attendant stuck his head out and told them to enter. Chris squeezed Annabel's hand briefly before handing her off to Susan and striding into the large room.

It was truly impressive, with grand arched ceilings, marble floors, and rows of seats for a few hundred audience members, now mostly empty. A subdued yellow light was given off by several floating orbs, magically suspended at least two stories above in the arches. A richly carpeted set of stairs led to an obsidian throne. Seated there was the first Drow that Chris had ever laid eyes on: a dark, slender elf of subterranean origin. A hush swept the room as people turned to see the newcomers, many seeing a dragon for the first time. 

Chris studied Lady Reyla Narlakis as he walked toward the throne. She was truly an elfin beauty. In her midnight blue gown, she looked truly royal, an air of ancient power about her. Her ears were pointed, contrasting her alabaster hair dramatically against flawless, pitch-black skin curved over sleek muscle and soft flesh. The shocking white was bound back away from her face in an elegant ponytail, jewelled ribbons maintaining its structure and weaving throughout the length, down to her shoulders. 

Reyla's grey eyes sparkled in delight as the young dragon approached in his half form, noting his appreciative study of her. She'd been informed that a back country witch was to bring in a powerful Being, but this was truly extraordinary. The dragon oozed power: both physically with his tall, broad form, and magically with his heady aura. His wings made him majestic, but in her eyes his simple clothes highlighted his youth. Yes, so rare and powerful a Being was a treasure. Her black heart thrilled at the prospect of snaring such a fine catch for her own.

Chris reached the base of the steps and lowered himself to his knees, his head bowed. He could sense the power of the ancient elf; his dragon recognised in her someone they could respect as superior in age, knowledge, and power. &quot;Lady Narlakis, I humbly present myself before your court seeking membership to your domain.&quot; Chris surprised himself with his almost theatrical manner of speech, but realised his dragon was helping him.

And well mannered too! Reyla thought, already slipping on the mask of a sweet, kindly demeanour. Quickly thinking through how to handle such an important meeting, she arose and descended from the throne to also kneel one step above him. Reaching down for his chin, she raised his face, eyes meeting. &quot;I am honoured to call you one of my own, dragon. We have missed your kind for far too long. What is your name? I do not recognise your colouring; do you have an aspect?&quot;

&quot;My name is Christopher Baryst,&quot; he introduced, still captivated by her grey eyes and royal, midnight beauty. He paused for a moment before his dragon helped him again, eyes flashing. &quot;I'm of the Ether.&quot; The dragon raised his hands. Purple flame sprang to life from his upturned palms. There was a collective intake of breath around the room as it cast an ethereal, flickering light. 

Reyla was rendered momentarily speechless. Before her knelt the 7th male dragon alive in the world, a youngling bursting with potential, untrained, and unmolded. Fortuitous in the extreme. She smiled down at him. This was no ordinary project; the future of the dragons knelt at her feet. &quot;Outstanding, Christopher,&quot; she said, leaning forward to kiss each of his purple cheeks, catching his enticing scent, yet she was too ancient to succumb to anything more than a pleasant sense of warmth between her legs. She willed a small charm as her lips touched his skin, to let her know where he was and if he was in danger. His dragon sensed her spell but allowed the protective blessing. Lady Narlakis stood back and addressed her rapt audience in her best regal voice, edged with threat. &quot;This dragon is under my protection. Any threat, harm, or plot against him will be met with my strictest displeasure. Dragons are guardians, and under his guardianship our community will prosper. We are honoured by his presence and you will all conduct yourselves accordingly. I will release an official statement to this effect shortly. This court is adjourned for the day.&quot;
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
The court audience shuffled out, looking back for once last peek at the dragon.

&quot;Rise Christopher,&quot; she said quietly. 

The fire in his hands extinguished as he stood. &quot;Lady, please just call me Chris, everyone does.&quot; 

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; Lady Narlakis said with a tinkling laugh. &quot;And you may call me Reyla when we are in private. How old are you, dragon?&quot;

&quot;I'm nineteen,&quot; he replied, a little disconcerted. She was much nicer than he had expected. &quot;My dragon awakened yesterday. Before that I was completely human; but Susan raised me with a basic knowledge of our world.&quot;

&quot;So young,&quot; Reyla cooed, reaching to brush his cheek, her mind already racing ahead to the prospect of a pet dragon at her beck and call. The room was now clear except for his escorts and her chief advisors. &quot;Come,&quot; she beckoned everyone closer. &quot;Sit, sit, we have a lot to get through.&quot; She guided the dragon to sit on a carpeted step, taking the step above as her own. &quot;Now, tell me your story."

He laid out his life as briefly as possible. For now he left Annabel out of the picture, although she sat only a few feet away. The Drow hadn't seemed to have noticed her yet.

&quot;Interesting.&quot; She took one of his big purple hands in her black ones, stroking it gently. &quot;What do you wish for yourself, dragon? How may I help you achieve your desires?&quot; At this, he had looked up at her with innocent trust; this was almost too easy.

&quot;I guess I just want to learn about our world and live my life. More specifically I need an education, a job, a home, and your protection,&quot; Chris replied honestly.

&quot;No great aspirations?&quot; Reyla asked seductively. &quot;Hmmm. So easily pleased. You are such a nice boy, Christopher.&quot; 

Annabel almost felt sick watching the elf paw at him. Surely he wasn't falling for her saccharine act.

&quot;None.&quot; He smarted a little at being called a boy in front of everyone, but coming from Lady Narlakis it was a fair assessment. 

&quot;Very well.&quot; Reyla turned to Susan. &quot;And what of yourself, witch? Why wasn't I made aware of a dormant dragon inside my own territory? You meant to keep him for yourself, no doubt.&quot; She regretted her words when she felt the dragon recoil, the hand she held suddenly tense.

&quot;No my lady,&quot; Susan responded calmly, not rising to the accusation. &quot;I only meant to protect him while he could not protect himself. Surely anonymity is the best defence. As soon as he awoke yesterday evening, we made plans to come here for your protection.&quot;

&quot;Nonetheless, I would have expected a loyal Being to inform me of something so important,&quot; Reyla said coldly. The implication was not lost on anyone in the room. Again she chastised herself, she was eroding his good first impression of her. And yet, she resented having been kept in the dark. Still, she must control her temper around him.

&quot;But all is well now that you are here, Chris,&quot; she soothed. &quot;I will contact the Synod immediately to inform them of you. I imagine you will need to go meet with their dragon representative, Lord Guthrie; but that can wait a few days. In the meantime, you may live in our guest quarters and explore our wonderful city. We can discuss your education later.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, a bit put off by her abrupt changes in demeanour. 

&quot;It's nothing Chris; all I ask in return is your loyalty and guardianship," Reyla assured sweetly. "Everything magical will prosper indirectly from your presence. Now, let's get the rights over with.&quot; 

Chris repeated after Reyla, reciting the induction rites for Beings allied to a new territory, swearing to uphold their laws, to serve his Lady, and to protect the Secret.

&quot;Well said Christopher,&quot; Reyla encouraged, sliding the hand that had been resting in his short purple hair during the ceremony down the side of his face. &quot;Now, let's get the details sorted out. Tosh, give him a registration and enter him into the system. But only put name, species, and class; Christopher can enter any further information if he wishes.&quot;

&quot;On it my Lady,&quot; came the reply from a tall Asian man, working on a tablet computer in his lap. &quot;What class shall I enter?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; murmured Lady Narlakis as she felt out the subtleties of the dragon's aura. &quot;I would have to agree that Class 1 is the most suitable.&quot; There was a bit of whispering between the others: Class 1 Beings were rare, very powerful. &quot;It will be nice to have a companion of similar capabilities again,&quot; Reyla flattered. &quot;The only Class 1 other than myself in the city is Envoron, but he is both senile and a Day elf, two things I cannot tolerate.&quot;

Someone tittered sycophantically at this, but Chris remained silent. They still hadn't discussed Annabel. Tosh saved what might have become an awkward silence by completing his registration, pending approval.

&quot;Your registration code is 01DR-053-59413, the first bit is just your class and species, the numbers are randomised, unique to you. I'll set up a phone and laptop for you to use on Maginet this afternoon. You know about Maginet, right?&quot; Tosh asked.

In the background, hushed conversations could be heard between some of the others in the room. Timothy was discussing new security measures around the guest quarters with a teammate; however most silently watched the interactions between dragon and Drow. Including Susan and Annabel.

&quot;A little, I've seen Susan using hers and I'm okay with computers.&quot; 

&quot;Tosh is very good with technology, he keeps things running around here,&quot; Reyla interjected, &quot;he's an arachnid you know, quite rare; I'm very lucky to have him.&quot; Tosh stuttered out a thanks before returning to his tablet. &quot;Now, you will also need security,&quot; she continued. &quot;What do you think, Timothy?&quot;

This had been the subject of Timothy's thoughts for the past few minutes. &quot;Well, he's powerful enough to handle himself; so what we need is someone to watch out for him, and back him up. A more subtle approach rather than a show of up-front muscle,&quot; reasoned the elemental.

Reyla agreed, mulling the possibilities over before confirming her initial decision. His primary protection couldn't be a man, there would be too much posturing between males this powerful; there always was. Lillian would be perfect: powerful and deadly enough to help protect the dragon, old enough to spot hidden threats, her loyalty insured due to the blood pact they had formed centuries ago. Besides, being around the young dragon would be torture for the vampire, which suited Reyla, given their current enmity.

&quot;Lillian,&quot; she called, knowing the vampire was listening, lurking, as her kind was inclined. The thump of boot steps on marble answered her.

&quot;Are you sure Reyla? We'll have to find a replacement for your own rotation.&quot; 

&quot;Yes I'm sure,&quot; she almost snapped at Timothy. &quot;She's perfect.&quot;

***

<i>'She's perfect',</i> echoed through Annabel's head when the Amazonian beauty approached Chris from behind. So tall, at over six foot, with a clearly powerful body, proportionally large curves and beautifully feminine lines. Her muscular legs were long and they looked amazing in tight jeans. The natural strut she seemed to pull off effortlessly was the best she had ever seen, hips jigging sideways a little with each long step. Annabel hadn't yet seen it from behind and already she knew it could probably cause accidents – plane crashes, even. 

The gorgeous valkyrie wore tall combat-style boots that didn't detract whatsoever from the vision of her as any man's perfect dream. Her great big tits must be D-cups or something, the way they bounced slightly with each step inside her clingy red turtleneck. She gave a sexy little flick of her head, dislodging some lustrous, shoulder-length, light brown hair that required a seductive swish back in place behind her ear. Mischievous brown eyes twinkled behind a forest of lashes, below which were deep shadows that made her look sultry, a little tired, like she should be taken back to bed, or, just simply taken. Her skin was absolutely white, and her face beautiful, perhaps with an overly wide mouth emphasized by plump lips: a seductive, hungry predator. She smiled, a Cheshire smile, revealing her vampiric nature for all to see, fangs displayed on the plush bed of her bottom lip.

Annabel saw it for what it was: an attention-grabbing entrance, and it seemed to be working. Thankfully Chris's back had been turned. How was she supposed to compete with that?

For her part, Lillian had been watching the proceedings from the start, observing Reyla attempt to charm the young dragon yet failing to hide her ugly temper and haughty arrogance. <i>Serves you right you black elf bitch, I hope he sees straight through you</i>. 

Reyla and Lillian had a long history. As a young vampire Lillian had been seduced by the powerful elf, entering into a blood pact with her: obedience and servitude, in exchange for power. This seemed wonderful at the time, especially to one who was generally governed by base desires in the early years of un-death. The pact enabled her to hold a secure place, in the upper levels of vampire hierarchy; an intoxicating feeling for any youngling, that also insured her survival during those vulnerable years.

As she had aged and matured, however, her vampiric cravings had mellowed, and she realised she had traded much of her free will. Reyla expected much in return. Initially, their relationship had been mutually beneficial, it had soured over the years as Reyla exerted control and ordered her to do her bidding. Four centuries had since passed, and she had grown into a tenacious, resourceful, and sometimes ruthless vampire, far too powerful to simply let slip away. Reyla knew this, and was fairly sure that Lillian was aware of this as well. 

Reyla kept Lillian close, a member of her personal guard, a position in which Lillian excelled. And yet the elf took every opportunity to punish the vampire's 'ungratefulness'. Lillian had no choice but to do the Lady's bidding, bound by the Drow's blood inside her own body, but took any small chance rebel, despite how futile. Half a century ago when she had asked for her freedom, Reyla had denied her. Apparently Lillian had many more centuries of service before the 'generous gift' would be paid off. In truth, Reyla had no intention of releasing her from her little collection of pets. And so it had continued, until the present day in which they lived to goad one another. Thus, when Lady Narlakis called Lillian to duty, undoubtedly she thought that guarding a dragon would be a torturous experience for the vampire. 

So Lillian flaunted her body proudly, knowing the conceited Drow would hate not being the centre of attention, even for a few seconds. She made sure her hips popped with each step, and displayed her fangs against her bottom lip seductively, revelling in the disapproval rolling off her liege. And yet it was true: assignment to guard this dragon would be excruciating. Already she could feel his scent flooding her nostrils, no longer the little tickle it had been while on the far side of the room. She would control herself, though. It was an opportunity to get away from Reyla and perhaps slight her at the same time. Furthermore, if she was close to the dragon, perhaps Lillian could steer him away from the treacherous elf's grasp.

Reyla watched Lillian's dramatic entrance, from her view directly over the dragon's wings. She strongly suspected that the vampire was goading her. Upon her approach she stood, gesturing Chris up too, politely turning him to introduce the vampire and thereby retain a picture of charming royal calm.

&quot;Christopher, this is Lillian Kozlov, your bodyguard,&quot; she said sweetly, eyes locking threateningly with Lillian's for a moment.

&quot;She's a vampire,&quot; was Chris's response, not moving forward to shake her hand.

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Lillian, letting a little of her native Russian accent tinge her words, just to piss off Reyla. &quot;But I'm much older than Amanda. I control myself far better.&quot; A mortified Amanda had already texted Lillian to inform her that she had attacked the young dragon, confessing to having found his taste unimaginably compelling.

&quot;Oh.&quot; Relenting, he moved forward to accept her handshake, eyeing her from head to toe as he did so. His dragon was thrilled no end at the thought of seducing her, subduing her large, powerful body before plundering her softness until she quivered. She would be a wonderful challenge. When his eyes finally reached her gaze, nearly level with his own, she winked. He knew he had been caught. Chris blushed a deeper purple, furiously. <i>Real smooth,</i> he despaired, yet still managing a &quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; 

She gave him an overly wide smile in return, and though the smile didn't quite reach her dark brown eyes, it lit her face with a devastating predatory beauty. &quot;It's nice to meet you too, Christopher,&quot; she replied, batting her eyelashes, for Reyla's benefit. She had, after all, appreciated his obvious attention and couldn't deny the dragon's powerful body as appealing; yet his timid nature reminded her of his young age. She preferred strong, confident men, who provided a challenge and were not intimidated by her. Admittedly, there were few men who fit this criteria yet still hadn't let their power get to their heads. Still, it was hard to maintain complete composure with his damnably sweet smell. Any physical contact might break her resolve. She locked it away as an impossibility. Lady Reyla would forbid it anyway, she would obey.

&quot;Good,&quot; Reyla concluded. &quot;Lillian will be responsible for your security day and night. Others will also be involved at times, but she will be in charge. Now, if that's all I'll leave you to make Christopher comfortable in his new home. I must go inform the Synod ... oh, and someone take the human girl's memories, I can't fathom why she's in here to begin with.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; came a menacing growl.

&quot;She knows about all of this,&quot; Reyla gestured around them, confused by the dragon's response. &quot;About you. Surely, you – &quot;

&quot;She is mine,&quot; the dragon interrupted, holding her gaze, his body tense. Everyone felt the change in atmosphere as the Beings assessed each other. &quot;I will take her as a familiar.&quot;

Reyla backpedalled. Obviously the girl meant something to him. And yet ... a human? It was beneath him. &quot;That's highly irregular, familiars need to be approved by – &quot;

&quot;You have the authority. I request your permission.&quot; It was, in fact, barely a request. The dragon spoke with a firmness that brooked no argument.

She had no choice. She couldn't deny his request without enraging the dragon; he might even try to flee with her. &quot;You may have her. I grant permission to take the girl as your familiar. See to that as well Lillian, I expect it to be done by the end of the day.&quot; Cocking her head slightly, Reyla couldn't help but reassess him. There was strength and dominating possessiveness lurking underneath the youthful meekness. It enraged her, yet thrilled her no end. She needed to plan more extensively for how to deal with him, and how to ensnare him. &quot;Christopher I apologise for distressing you, I wasn't aware of her importance. I would like to speak with you again tomorrow, once you're settled of course. I expect the Synod will have a plan of action formulated by then.&quot;

&quot;Good day, everyone.&quot; Affecting regal serenity, she turned, her white, bejewelled ponytail sparkling, and strode away. 

There was a collective moment of relaxation as the Drow swished gracefully away. Everyone except Chris's party that now included the chuckling vampire, had cleared the room to head about their business.

***

&quot;Lillian,&quot; muttered Timothy threateningly.

The two stood together, watching the distraught human girl embrace the dragon desperately.

&quot;Calm yourself, Tim,&quot; She whispered, barely containing her mirth. &quot;That was fantastic. Did you see her face?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the elemental sighed. &quot;She almost lost her cool for a second there. Don't push her.&quot; He held Lillian in awe. Lady Narlakis had a temper, that was a fact, but was generally fair with everyone who didn't piss her off. Lillian went out of her way to do just that, and it made her a bit of a legend.

&quot;Okay, we'll go to the rooms first, then the tattoo, then probably the rooms again," Lillian outlined the schedule. "After they're done with making her a familiar we can show him around the Compound. He can't go outside looking like that, though. Maybe tonight he can go visit the club or something.&quot; 

&quot;That sounds fine, are you going to be okay with this?&quot; Timothy asked. &quot;Amanda was on him straight away; you should have seen it though, he had her by the neck so fast I barely saw it. He just about killed her but the human started making a fuss and he stopped.&quot; 

&quot;Interesting.&quot; She approached the dragon, giving the witch a nod of acknowledgement. &quot;Christopher, let's go see where you'll be living, then we can get started on making her your familiar.&quot;

&quot;Sure, and please call me Chris. It looks like we'll be spending a bit of time together.&quot; He released Annabel from their long hug; still holding onto him, she gave the beautiful vampire a surprisingly hateful glare. 

&quot;Thank you, Chris. And what's your name?&quot; Lillian offered Annabel a hand to shake. 

Annabel didn't accept it. It was childish, but she refused all the same.

At this, Lillian leant down. This human female was pretty enough; perhaps a little skinny by her own standards, but that was the fashion these days wasn't it? She must be his girlfriend, strong minded enough to see past his wings and scales. Good for her. &quot;Listen,&quot; she tried for a conspiratorial tone, &quot;I imagine this is quite overwhelming. But you don't have to worry about me. That's more than I can say for some of the others around here. I won't try to steal him from you,&quot; she winked as she spoke the last sentence, and Annabel blushed violently.

&quot;Sorry, I'm Annabel,&quot; she offered her hand shyly. &quot;It's all just a bit much at the moment.&quot;

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; said Lillian, shaking it, but not before glancing up at the dragon for approval to do so.

***

Lillian guided them through the underground complex, explaining various services and functions. There were about 4500 Beings in the Mid-West territory, most of whom lived in the Denver metropolitan area. Lady Narlakis provided many kinds of support to Beings in her territory, policed their laws, and maintained the Secret. Beings provided something in return to help the community: a tax system of sorts, usually paid by barter of services. Beings had their own economy based in trade using mostly precious metals and stones as currency which also had intrinsic value for magics and spells. Human currency still played its part, because everyone interacted with that world as well, Lillian explained. Chris already knew most of this, but Annabel absorbed it all like a sponge.

Upon arriving at an elevator, Lillian inserted her key card and they stepped inside, travelling upward while she explained that they were now traversing underneath the city block to their hotel suite, inside a hotel for Beings only. They were quite high up when they arrived on their floor, where again a key card was required for entry.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
Their suite was quite spacious, one of only two abodes on the entire floor. Elaborately furnished, the dark heartwood accents contrasted nicely with the gentle pastel interiors. There were pieces of tasteful local art throughout, including some clearly made by Beings. All of the windows, which were extensive along one side, were installed with retractable shades currently pulled down, effectively blocking out all sunlight. They could open them if they desired, but Lillian cautioned them to please tell her beforehand; she was a vampire after all.

While Chris and Annabel made themselves comfortable in the master bedroom, Susan took one of the spare rooms. Lillian set up shop in another: while on duty she would live with them. When asked about taking time out from what sounded like exhaustive surveillance duties, Lillian explained that she didn't expect to do so. Frankly, she rarely slept anymore.

Lunch was delivered via room service: burgers for Chris and Annabel and an omelette for Susan. Lillian ordered a 'blood box' – the vampire equivalent of a juice box – a concept Annabel initially found immensely funny until the implications of harvesting human blood sunk in. All four of them sat at the dining room table, Annabel next to Chris, opposite Lillian. While they ate, Susan remained quiet, sizing Lillian up; trying to figure out what hidden games might be in store. Lillian must be powerful, she knew, and highly trusted to be assigned to protect Chris; but what exactly would the vampire be reporting to Lady Narlakis, she wondered.

&quot;So your aspect is the Ether. How does that work?&quot; Lillian asked, sipping her blood while they finished off their fries.

&quot;I don't know,&quot; Chris answered honestly. He'd begun to warm to the seemingly-friendly vampire. &quot;I used to dream in the Ether some nights. This is all very new to me." He explained about his father's enchantment. "Yesterday, I fell into the Ether when I had a nap, woke up, and had a walk around in there. I actually ended up scaring the hell out of Mom.&quot;

&quot;Very interesting,&quot; Lillian mused, &quot;you know, it's a unique aspect among dragons. There hasn't been an Ether dragon before. I imagine you will grow to be quite formidable. Dragons always are, but if you can learn to phase, and to harness the energy of the Ether for magic, you would become very powerful.&quot;

Everyone seemed to be obsessed with how powerful he would become. &quot;I just want an uncomplicated life.&quot;

Lillian's guffaw echoed in the room and Susan had to smile a little too. &quot;You certainly won't have an uncomplicated life. No one does.&quot; Perhaps because he was young, he didn't yet understand the world. She was finding it a little easier to relax around him, especially after her blood meal; perhaps she was just getting accustomed to his scent. The girl, however, still eyed her warily, while the witch silently studied her.

&quot;Well. Let's go get her the tattoo,&quot; Lillian announced, once they had all finished eating.

&quot;Me?!&quot; Annabel squeaked. She hated all things 'needle'.

&quot;Is that really necessary?&quot; Chris knew it was, but asked anyway.

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Susan replied out of the blue from the head of the table. &quot;Without it, you won't be legally protected against the actions of other Beings. You'll be a regular human. Nowadays, they tattoo the owner's ID number on each familiar. They used to brand humans, like cattle.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and without your master's tattoo I could come gobble you up in the night,&quot; was Lillian's light-hearted rejoinder. Chris hissed. &quot;Relax,&quot; the vampire eased, &quot;I meant it as a joke. Although it's true, you know.&quot; 

&quot;Do you really hunt people? Kill them to drink their blood?&quot; Annabel asked.

&quot;Well of course I do, I'm a vampire. Most of us try not to kill our victims. It's greedy, you know; messy, too.&quot; Damping down her sharp wit, she continued, &quot;We each have an allotment of humans we are allowed to kill each year; some vampires get off on it, but they usually don't last long. We are allowed as many non-fatal feedings as we need, provided we leave no trace behind, keep the Secret, and all that. Human familiars of other Beings are off-limits, though," she added kindly. "A lot of vampires just keep their own human familiars, or feed from another willing Being.&quot;

&quot;That's sick, how can you just treat people like that?&quot; Annabel whined. Chris hugged her across the small gap between their chairs; still, she felt a little nauseous at the idea.

Lillian wasn't at all offended by the girl's accusations. &quot;It's just nature Annabel, it isn't pretty," she explained patiently, meeting the girl's bright eyes. This was a serious subject, the human needed to understand that the Being world wasn't some idealised fantasy. "Vampires aren't even the worst; true demons used to go on absolute bloodbaths before they got stopped. That hasn't happened in several hundred years. And it's been very rare since the Devines put a barrier around our dimension millennia ago, saying it was unfair that demons still influenced our lives, even after the ban.&quot; She had embraced her nature long ago. A hungry vampire was a dead vampire, after all.

Susan looked on approvingly, it wasn't the most gentle of lessons in the uglier side, but it would be good for both Annabel and Chris.

Slumping sideways back into Chris's body with a slight sigh, Annabel was rocked. &quot;Demons? Holy shit ... what, what about God? The Devil? At least tell me <i>you</i> don't go around killing people. I mean you're a good vampire, right?&quot; Magical Beings were one thing but she'd lost faith once she realised that people did all manner of things in the name of their gods.

Across the table Lillian laughed huskily, watching the dynamic between the two, they certainly seemed to take a lot of comfort in physical contact with each other. The girl was as delightfully innocent as the dragon. &quot;Well. I don't know that there's such a thing as a 'good' vampire, darling. Perhaps I am. I did kill a man last year, but then again he was a rapist; that was more of a murder than a feeding. Demons and Devines certainly exist, perhaps not as you've thought of them. One thing's for sure though," Lillian leaned forward, speaking thoughtfully as she twirled some of her lustrous brown hair out of habit with a finger. "They hate each other. What do they fight about? The fate of our souls: who knows?" she mused aloud. "As for God, or gods, or the Devil: who knows? I have no more proof of their existence than you. Mightn't an entity powerful beyond our comprehension appear to be a god? We would have no way to know if it was a god or just some small fry in the scheme of the universe and all its dimensions.&quot; She paused and leaned back, stretching in an unintentional display of her impressive breasts, signalling her withdrawal from further philosophical discussion. &quot;Anyway, all this is besides the point. You need to get a tattoo in order to be his familiar.&quot;

&quot;Fine. Okay,&quot; Annabel agreed. The vampire's talk and her piercing gaze had managed to intimidate her more than did the idea of getting a tattoo. &quot;Do I have to do anything else?&quot;

&quot;You'll repeat some rights like Chris did today. Then he'll do the same and put some energy into your binding. Other Beings will then be able to sense it and know you're a familiar. That part will be painless.&quot; To Lillian, it felt like overseeing a wedding. In a way, she was.

They rode the elevator back down below-ground, popping up in a shaded back alley. Behind a door, a suitably surprised, heavily-tattooed wizard greeted them, introducing himself as Garry. He had heard rumours earlier that day that a dragon was in town, but had dismissed them as bullshit. Now, he was stoked. A scenario began playing out in his head as he ushered them in and set up his tools: tattooing the dragon's familiar was going to give him a story to tell at the bar tonight. Women would be pawing all over him just to hear it....

***

Her left shoulder fucking throbbed! At least it was over now and she could suffer quietly, lying on the hotel bed. She'd put on a brave face, trying to show the hot vampire that she had toughs. Now she just wanted Chris, maybe some ice cream too; but he was out in the living room fussing over his new laptop and smartphone with Tosh, the Japanese spider guy. He was such a sweet nerd sometimes, getting excited about his new stuff. She hoped they would still have time to play an occasional video game together once everything settled down. Drifting a little, her mind wandered over the last 24 hours, the most eventful of her young life. 

Before she had detected any sign of his approach, Chris was back in the room, picking her up off the bed. &quot;Are you okay, Dee?&quot; he soothed, holding her so as not to bump her sore shoulder. She could walk just fine, yet he took some satisfaction from treating her like an invalid, trying to comfort her.

&quot;I'll be fine. It hurt like a bitch but it's not so bad now,&quot; Annabel fibbed. He'd carried her gently and then lowered her onto one of the rich leather couches where she now reclined, her legs bent and tucked neatly underneath her.

&quot;Well, Susan reminded me that I might be able to help with that,&quot; he replied, gently lifting the material along one shoulder of her light blue dress and easing down her bra-strap to reveal a bandage. It covered the string of black numerals, about a half inch high, imprinted along her tender left shoulder blade, her dyed skin raised up and inflamed, like stinging Braille. Removing it carefully, he examined the exposed tattoo. <i>053 59413</i>. Annabel winced a little as the bandage came off, but let him shuffle around her until he knelt, settling behind her, on the couch. He guided her down and forward a little, holding her upper arms gently. Then he started licking across the fevered numerals, hoping his saliva would provide some relief.

Initially, his purple, semi-forked, reptilian tongue felt hot on her sore skin; but as he continued, it seemed to have a cooling effect. Before she knew it, the pain was easing away. &quot;Ohhh, it's working Chris. Keep going, it feels so good,&quot; she murmured. 

He lapped until the irritated red colour faded back into flawlessness. Only, it wasn't entirely flawless: the string of numbers contrasted sharply against her milky skin. She shouldn't have had to mark her body like that.

Susan and Lillian watched the unintentionally erotic display from the kitchen. Given the position and his movements, he might almost be screwing her gently from behind. His larger, draconian body arched to lick and nip her shoulder while holding her in place. That he was in fact gently healing her, added something pure and loving to the pose.

&quot;That's fucking hot. He's going to be a lady-killer,&quot; Lillian murmured distractedly, in danger of revisiting her initial evaluation of Chris's suitability as a lover.

&quot;Mm hm,&quot; Susan agreed, unable to take her eyes off the lovebirds, instantly aroused, and finding herself less and less willing to hold back. Just being near the dragon and his scent was whittling down her power to resist him at an alarming rate.

Annabel opened her eyes and saw the two women in the kitchen, watching them. She quickly pulled her shoulder strap up, embarrassed about almost showing tit. Chris, who had been enjoying tonguing her smooth, slightly salty skin and giving her little kisses, stopped too; he had been fully caught up in the moment. His Mom and Lillian had been watching. He blushed a deeper purple. Perhaps the couch wasn't the best place.... And yet he hadn't intended it to become sexual.

&quot;Ooh! That was so cute,&quot; Lillian exclaimed, breaking the spell. This assignment was turning out to be fun; a far cry from being cooped up with a prissy, self indulgent, Drow bitch. She hated feigning civility and obedience. The blood pact continually forced her to do as Lady Narlakis ordered; she could resist, but doing so left her weak and therefore vulnerable. Watching two young things, desperately in love but so unsure of themselves, was so much better. Now the purple dragon was all flustered and embarrassed, so uncharacteristic in a Class 1 Being.

&quot;Okay, let's do the ceremony." Lillian approached the couch. "I've written down what you need to say. I'll be your witness.&quot; She handed them each a scrap of paper.

&quot;What do I have to do, Mom?&quot; Chris asked, unsure. &quot;I've never even used magic.&quot;

&quot;It'll be fine Chris,&quot; Susan assured, walking over. &quot;It's not really a spell so much as a pact. Just hold Annabel in your mind and say the words. Some Beings give their familiars a more personal, magical marking in the process but don't worry about that. It's just a ceremony.&quot; She didn't actually have experience with wielding the magic involved in taking a familiar ... but it couldn't be that complicated. Most Beings could do this; even those who didn't practice traditional magic, like Weres or vampires.

Chris and Annabel faced each other on the couch and looked down at the scribbled words. 

&quot;Ready, Dee?&quot; Chris asked tentatively, &quot;You know you don't have to...&quot;

&quot;Oh, shush,&quot; Annabel teased. &quot;So eager to get rid of me?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Good, I love you babe,&quot; she replied, leaning up to give him a chaste kiss, still mindful of their audience. &quot;Let's do this. I go first, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Just say the words ... and mean them,&quot; Susan added.

One last time Annabel glanced at the note, memorising the words, before looking into his loving eyes, grasping his taloned hand, and promising her life to him. It was so dramatic. &quot;Being, I give myself freely to you, bind myself to you. I vow to serve, place you above all others, and uphold the Secret. I'm yours.&quot; She meant it all. As the final syllable left her lips she felt an involuntary tremble course through her body. This wasn't just about saying some words anymore; something of herself had left her and now reached out, tendril-like, toward the dragon.

Chris felt it too, nudging against his aura, seeking acceptance. He and the dragon accepted her and enveloped her in return. Gently pulling her close, he held her against his neck so he could say the words in her ear. Holding a pristine vision of Annabel in his mind's eye, he saw her protected, secure, and loved. He spoke aloud in his deep, slightly hissing voice. &quot;Human, I accept you, place you under my protection. I share the Secret and mark you as one of us. Serve me well. <i>I love you</i>.&quot; 

Those last three words were his own. He hugged her tighter. Blood roared in his ears: a staggering drain of energy poured out of himself and into her. Energy, mixed with magic, flowed out of him at an alarming rate. Scared, he opened his eyes for several seconds. The seconds multiplied, and it still hadn't stopped; his vision was darkening and he couldn't release his grip. He let out a strangled gasp just before blacking out.

Annabel felt something enormously powerful wrap around her as he squeezed the air from her lungs. Searing heat streamed over her tattoo where one of his hands gripped her, his claws digging through the thin fabric of her dress. She struggled, whimpering. Something rushed into her, her body stiffened as if electrified, and just as quickly it was over. She fell back, stunned, with Chris's limp body crumpled on top of hers.

Susan was at their side in an instant. Something had gone terribly wrong; as soon as Chris had begun speaking, an overabundance of energy had tainted the air. With its sudden release, she had been bowled backward by the wave and slumped heavily against the coffee table. Momentarily she regained her senses and saw Chris's human body smothering Annabel.

&quot;The fuck was that!?&quot; Lillian spat. The dragon's body had twitched and shuddered before shrinking back into his human form, his wings grotesquely sucked into his back, collapsing on themselves, the purple membranes dissolving back into the finger-like support bones. The bones crumpled sequentially inwards as the rest of his colour and scales faded until there was no trace of the dragon left.

&quot;I don't know, help me!&quot; Susan shrieked, stumbling over and rolling his limp body off of Annabel onto the other side of couch. Feeling his neck for a pulse and listening for breath, she felt and heard them, faint and barely audible. &quot;Check her!&quot; 

&quot;He's human again,&quot; the vampire noted, glancing over at him as she knelt by the unconscious human girl. She reached to shake her gently. &quot;Aaaagh ahh!&quot; No sooner had she touched Annabel's skin, when she suddenly reared up and backed against the far wall in a flash of inhuman speed, clutching her blackened hand and slumping down the wall in agony. An acrid, burnt flesh smell filled the room.

Susan swivelled to see the vampire wailing helplessly, fangs extended as bloody tears streaked her pretty face. She stared; it was the worst burn she had ever even heard of, let alone seen. Snapping back to her son, she quickly assured that he was indeed breathing. Somehow, he had put far too much energy into the familiar bond, driving the dragon far back into hiding. 

Lillian cried piteously while next Susan quickly examined Annabel albeit from a safe distance. &quot;What have you done, Chris?&quot; she murmured to herself, feeling out toward Annabel with magical senses. What her sensations felt made her draw right back. Something had rushed out at her, sensing intrusion: it was powerful, intelligent, and felt like ... the dragon. Power literally oozed; Susan could 'see' it soaking into Annabel's skin, merging with her. Raw, magical power, burned bright purple in her mind's eye. What the hell did it mean?

Lillian's sobs brought Susan back from observation and into action. She got up and approached cautiously, getting close enough for a good look at the vampire's damaged hand. Across the palm and fingers the skin was charred to the bone, bubbled and blackened. Some streaks of healthy skin remained in places on the back. 

An injured vampire was a very dangerous creature. Had Lillian still maintained control? &quot;Lillian,&quot; she called gently. &quot;I'm so sorry. Can you hear me? Is it safe to come closer?&quot;

Lillian heard the witch but god it hurt so much. Worse than the time long ago when her leg had been crushed. She self-assessed, and found that her vampiric nature had retreated, shocked, into the background. Usually, when injured it was next to impossible for her to refrain from sucking the nearest living thing dry. &quot;I... I think so. Please help me,&quot; she groaned.

&quot;Hang in there Lillian; what can I do?&quot; Susan rushed forward the last few feet, kneeling beside her.

&quot;Blood,&quot; Lillian whimpered. &quot;Help me to the kitchen.&quot; They pulled each other up, Lillian cradling her useless hand gently with the other. &quot;In the fridge. All of it, get all of it!&quot; Drained by the magical burn, she could barely stand, and allowed Susan to support her as they stumbled over to one of the big silver fridges. 

Susan grabbed an armful of blood bags and dumped the first load on the bench alongside the sink. 

&quot;More!&quot; Lillian hissed, fangs flashing as she pulled a bag from Susan's grip and sunk her teeth into it, messily splattering her chin and neck, dripping onto her turtleneck and staining it an even deeper red. Her previously light brown irises dilated to all-black as Susan returned with a second round. 

&quot;In the sink, cut them into the sink!&quot; Lillian spluttered before ripping into another. Susan plugged the sink, grabbed a knife, and slit bag after bag, draining the contents into the stainless steel basin until Lillian told her to stop. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
Gingerly, Lillian reached over and lowered her useless hand into the few inches of chilled crimson, breathing a sigh as it provided some relief. In her other hand she held her fourth bag, sipping from it, the blood's rejuvenating effects somewhat countered by the onset of bloat from having recently glugged it down. 

&quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot; Susan asked tentatively, leaning against a fridge door across the way. It had been downright terrifying to be so close to the vampire, while she had screamed for blood. Her intake had been voracious. What would happen if the fridge ran out? 

Under normal circumstances, the smell of Susan's fear would excite her. Lillian, however, only sighed and burped; she must be a right mess, covered in blood. Glancing first around the kitchen, she then turned to look grimly over at the witch. &quot;Yes, I'll be fine in a while. You don't have to worry about me biting you. I'm stuffed.&quot; A slight sense of euphoria had begun grow as her hand throbbed painfully. It had begun to heal, submerged in the pool of blood. &quot;There had better be a damn good explanation for this,&quot; she added grimly.

&quot;There isn't,&quot; Susan replied, &quot;he's put an enchantment on her, somehow. I've never seen anything like it. I suspect he meant it to protect her. It must have lashed out when you touched her.&quot;

&quot;How did that happen? You said he couldn't use magic,&quot; Lillian snapped, narrowing her eyes.

They were both in shock, she realized too late; she needed to maintain her discipline, remain calm.

&quot;I said he hasn't <i>used</i> magic,&quot; Susan snapped back, &quot;He's never cast a spell in his life until now." She snorted. "The first one he tries, almost wipes him out. It's the dragon. Chris wouldn't know how to place an enchantment like that.&quot;

&quot;You talk about them like they're two different Beings.&quot; Lillian groaned under her breath from a fresh onset of sensations, as newly-regenerated muscles and ligaments began to knit together.

&quot;One Being. Two sides,&quot; Susan clarified. &quot;Just like you have a human side and a vampiric side. Sometimes you're talking to Chris, sometimes a dragon.&quot;

&quot;You know I have to report this.&quot; Lillian pulled her hand out of the blood briefly to inspect the progress. The blackened layers of skin were gone. Raw nerves burned from within the fresh layer of sub-dermis, exposed to air without an outer protective layer of skin yet generated, to cover them.

Susan wasn't squeamish as a rule, but the vampire's healing hand looked unnaturally gruesome: myriad growing tissues writhed as they absorbed the blood. She had felt relief after it was once again submerged. Looking away, she noted the state of the kitchen. Spattered blood, ripped bags littered and dripped across the nearby counters and floor. She chuckled almost maniacally. What a mess. They hadn't even been here for a full day. The statement about making a report swam back into focus.... The vampire didn't grasp the situation at all. 

&quot;Report?" Susan exclaimed. "Every Being with any magical sensitivity within 200 miles of here felt that! The Synod will be having a fucking emergency phone conference as we speak. I should have known this wouldn't stay quiet. What's Lady Narlakis going to do now?&quot;

&quot;I can only guess,&quot; Lillian said honestly if still a bit sharply, despite attempts to infuse her voice with calm. &quot;She wants him for herself, so she'll protect him. She'll be tempted; but I doubt she'll make a direct play to take him from you. You know how she is, no?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I know. Will you help me?&quot; Susan had sensed the edge in Lillian's voice; nevertheless, she could really use a friend in this.

&quot;I already am.&quot; Lillian attempted to smile, before wincing again as she tried moving her fingers. &quot;I hate that elf more than you can imagine; but we have a blood pact, I'm bound to her.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Blood pacts were a particularly powerful bond, very rare these days. &quot;How?&quot;

&quot;I was young and greedy,&quot; Lillian admitted. &quot;Stupid, too.&quot;

&quot;How will you help us, then?&quot; Susan pressed on. &quot;Wait, what did she give you in return?&quot;

Firmly, Lillian disciplined herself to become calm, to relax through the pain of her healing hand and the excitement of the last few minutes. &quot;I'll run whatever diversions I can, while you get him on his feet. It won't be much, but anything to fuck with Reyla sounds great. In the end though, I do what she tells me." She flexed, grimaced, and continued. "Perhaps I'll just do exactly that. None of my own thinking or reporting helpful little insights.&quot; It might actually be enough to throw the Drow off a little. She looked at Susan with a serious, steady gaze. &quot;Ultimately though, Susan, Reyla isn't your enemy. You just need to watch out for your dragon until he and the lady settle into their relationship.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I'm relying on Reyla to protect him. Well, I'm relying on you; I just don't want her claws in him this early. He needs to be independent.&quot; If only they could make her see past Chris's value as simply an item for her collection.... If Reyla befriended him, she would have his loyalty without his resentment. &quot;Hey, what about your part of the blood pact?&quot;

&quot;Well, I can do this.&quot; Using her power, she lifted Susan slightly, suspending her a scant inch off of the ground.

&quot;Oh! What's –? Put me down!&quot; Weightlessness was a disconcerting feeling; Susan wanted none of it. 

At the sound of her shriek, Lillian hastily released her. Once back on the ground Susan felt a bit embarrassed; she heard Lillian chuckle and waited a few seconds, regaining composure before continuing. 

&quot;You're telekinetic. That's very powerful for a vampire.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, pretty cool huh?&quot; was Lillian's slightly sarcastic rejoinder, wincing again during a particularly painful few seconds' healing.

&quot;Not at your price. I appreciate your help though; I'll need all I can get, to keep him safe. If you're okay I'll go check on them again, just don't touch Annabel again until we know how this enchantment works.&quot;

&quot;I'm almost done healing," Lillian looked up at Susan's retreating form. "And yeah, I'm not touching the girl with a broomstick; it would explode. Be careful, you can't heal like I do,&quot; she added, surprising herself with a sudden, almost sisterly twinge of concern for the witch. Just then her pocket started buzzing; it was her cellphone. Probably Reyla. 

Susan had stopped and turned in the doorway to listen. 

Lillian gave her an approving nod as she pulled out the phone. &quot;Yes, Reyla,&quot; she answered. &quot;You felt that? Yes, Susan said he put an enchantment on the girl.... I have no idea, I'm not a witch.... No, she's legally his familiar now.... No, I can't, I have my hand in a sink full of blood because it almost got burned off when I tried to touch her.... No, they both passed out.... Fine, I'll come see you in half an hour.... No, it's been quite a busy afternoon, my Lady.... Fine, I'll turn the bugs on before I leave.... No I'm not feeling rebellious, it's just my hand.... Yes.... Yes, I'll be fine.... Goodbye.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; 

&quot;She felt it. I think she's actually a little scared. I have to go report to her soon and boot up the surveillance system before I go. She's pissed I didn't do it to begin with.&quot;

&quot;What kind of system?&quot;

&quot;Video and sound in all the rooms. There's no getting around it, really. You should look for your own accommodations as soon as possible; although for the time being, this is very secure. I recommend you don't tell Chris and Annabel; they might accidentally give me away,&quot; Lillian reasoned.

&quot;Thank you, it means a lot that you'll help me.&quot; Susan looked at the bloodstained vampire in a new, more friendly light.

&quot;Eh,&quot; Lillian smiled, flashing fang. &quot;This is the most exciting thing since that unicorn lost it and rampaged through half the magic district. Wish I could have avoided this, though,&quot; she flashed her a half-hearted grin, turning back to her healing hand in the sink.

***

Reyla observed the witch, Susan, via the now-activated window on her tablet's screen. Lillian had finally powered up the surveillance system a few minutes ago, just as Reyla had ended a lengthy phone conversation with the rather relieved Synod. They'd been quite perplexed, upon first receiving the field reports. That the newly discovered dragon had been the source of such a powerful spell, added more fuel to the proverbial gossip fire. Maginet was probably already abuzz with speculation about its significance. Reyla would have avoided such publicity at all costs; the more tongues wagged, the harder it would be to keep the dragon for her own purposes. Already, the Synod had put plans in motion to meet with Lord Guthrie face-to-face; they'd arranged for a jet to take Chris to Europe in a few days. Meanwhile, they would be 'advising' her on his care and education, 'checking in regularly'.

Usually quick to assess, judge, and devise a cunning plan, Reyla, was at a loss. In truth, she had no idea what to do with her unique, young Being.

&quot;My Lady.&quot; Lillian interrupted Reyla's musing, entering quietly into her lavish, darkened office.

&quot;You look a mess, Lillian.&quot; Reyla noted the blood smeared across the vampire's face, neck, and arms, matting her brown hair in places, and staining her top.

&quot;Yes. I consumed quite a lot, used even more on my hand.&quot; She displayed it for Reyla's review, fleshed-out and covered with new pink skin.

&quot;What of the dragon?&quot; 

&quot;Can't you see for yourself?&quot; Lillian gestured toward the tablet resting in Reyla's lap.

&quot;He's just lying there. He's human again. The witch is watching him.&quot; 

&quot;Then you know as much as I do,&quot; said the vampire.

&quot;Well. Go back and protect him," Reyla commanded imperiously. "Now that everyone knows there's a youngling dragon up for grabs, I would be surprised if someone <i>didn't</i> try something. Use that bear-man you like for extra muscle, if you require." She sniffed. "There will be a trip to London in a few days but you'll have Synod approval. No one will touch you there. In the meantime report to me daily. I don't want any more upsets, Lillian.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, my Lady,&quot; purred Lillian. She narrowed her eyes, calculating.... The elf seemed rattled. Time to push some buttons. &quot;You have no idea what you're doing, do you?&quot;

&quot;Enough!&quot; Reyla hissed, &quot;I've had enough of your insolence. Get out.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, my Lady,&quot; Lillian intoned insincerely, and turned to go.

Reyla's smiling riposte suddenly demanded her to attend. &quot;Oh Lillian, how do you find him? Is his blood irresistible? Will you be able to control yourself?&quot; Her tone of voice reflected Lillian's earlier insincerity. <i>Touch</i><i>é</i>.

&quot;It's hard, my Lady.&quot; Lillian turned back, choosing to respond honestly this time, and gave her a smile to match, albeit a blood-spattered one. &quot;But I'll manage. Perhaps, you should be more concerned about yourself. I know I am.&quot;

Filling her next words with arcane power, eyes flashing, Reyla barely contained her temper. &quot;You will not taste him, you may not drink his blood, nor may you even touch him. I forbid it.&quot;

&quot;I had no intent.&quot; The vampire smirked, quietly triumphant, &quot;Perhaps you're projecting – &quot;

&quot;Out!&quot; screeched the midnight elf. 

Lillian spun around and strode out, hiding her amusement at having reached her ladyship's limit. She had just unwittingly made Lillian's life easier. Such an order, issued through their blood pact, would now make the dragon easier to resist.

Reyla resumed her gaze at the surveillance window on-screen. After only a short time had passed, however, she could barely keep from throwing it against the wall, so frustrated had she become by the inactivity. This could become one of her greatest moments, and yet it had equal potential to be her downfall. After a single meeting, she had him deeply secured under her skin; such a temptation. His power and innocence only added to his allure, calling to her darkest desires for control, manipulation, and even enslavement. Perhaps, she mused, she should just fuck him and be done with it. It was probably a bad idea though; she wouldn't be able to resist binding him once he had penetrated her, his powerful body locked within the grip of her arms and legs. No. The Synod wouldn't take kindly to that....

Besides, the magical wake of the dragon's spell was the largest since the recent update to Maginet security two years ago. And that had taken roughly 150 mages to create, working together. What exactly was this dragon capable of? 

She reassessed: the political advantage alone was immense. She wouldn't waste it by enslaving him with trickery or magic. She wouldn't squander this opportunity. Instead, she would train him, nurture him, and develop him into a powerful instrument. It would likely take centuries.... But it would be worth it, and he would be grateful. Who knows? He might prove to be her equal, her match. Lurking beneath his timid, boyish nature, she'd glimpsed a dragon that might become one who would eventually tame her. There she went, daydreaming like she was only a few centuries old again. This dragon was already too dangerous.

***

Annabel's eyelids fluttered as she came around, sitting up suddenly. She remembering Chris almost crushing her, energy flowing around her, through her. He was lying on the couch next to her now, She found herself sitting on the couch at the other end, leaning against an armrest. He lay nearby, human again. No more wings, no more purple or creamy skin, no more claws. He looked slightly smaller.

&quot;Please don't move, Annabel,&quot; Susan spoke softly from the opposite couch. 

&quot;Susan? What's going on? Is Chris sleeping?&quot; Annabel whispered, not wanting to wake her boyfriend.

Susan sighed. She had watched her for the last hour as her son's spell continued its work, only just detectable beneath the surface of her aura, but definitely there. &quot;He's passed out, Annabel. Look, I don't know what's going on, but just stay calm and don't touch anything. He somehow put an enchantment on you during the ceremony. It was really powerful; and now he's wiped out.&quot; 

&quot;What the hell.... What kind of enchantment? Wait, why can't I touch anything?&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry honey, but after it happened you were both unconscious. Lillian tried to check if you were okay and got a really bad burn when she touched you.&quot;

&quot;What?! Is she okay? Why would it do that? &quot; her voice had raised but it didn't seem to have any impact on Chris.

&quot;She'll be fine, she used blood to heal quickly. I think it's a protective enchantment, that's the only thing that makes sense, Annabel. Perhaps it sensed she was a vampire and lashed out at her. Do you feel any different? Did you feel anything strange before you fainted?&quot; 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Annabel exclaimed. &quot;It felt like something went through me, like an electric shock. He was holding me so tightly I couldn't breathe, digging his claws in by my shoulder. Can you check if I need a BandAid, please?&quot; She pulled down her dress's collar so Susan could see, twisting to look at her shoulder at the same time.

They both just gaped for several seconds. There was a dragon on her shoulder, straight out of a medieval tale or a story book, only purple. Such a beautiful tattoo. Susan got off the couch to have a closer look. The fine, indelible detail, so lifelike it could only have been done by magic, was etched into her skin atop her registration number; its tail twining around the last few digits. It looked about three inches long: a miniature purple dragon with wings and a flexible tail, tiny white spikes at the end, modelled after Chris's full dragon form. 

&quot;Is that what Chris will look like, when he goes all the way?&quot; Annabel asked, she was pulling her left shoulder forward with her other hand, trying to get a better look.

&quot;Yes. I think so,&quot; Susan replied, inching closer still. &quot;Only bigger, but I think that's his full dragon form.&quot; It was probably just Annabel pulling her skin tighter, and yet Susan could have sworn she saw the tiny dragon's chest rising and falling gently.

&quot;He's beautiful,&quot; cooed Annabel, happy Chris had taken the effort to make her ugly tattoo more personal to the two of them. 

The tattoo dragon lifted its arrowhead-like snout on his flexible neck to look up at Annabel. The women screamed. Susan fell back onto the couch clutching her pounding chest, experiencing a fright worse than when Chris had showed her some shock site on the internet. Annabel kept screaming as the startled miniature dragon took off, galloping across her skin to find cover under her dress. 

There was a warm, crawly tickle as it scuttled down her back, coming to a stop near her hip. This felt way too much like having a bug on her skin. &quot;Get it off! Get it off! Get it off meeeee!&quot; she wailed, frozen in place, hoping it would stop moving .

Susan was dumbstruck, trying to reconcile what she had seen while getting her breathing back under control.

&quot;Susan!&quot; Annabel pleaded, &quot;I can feel it, get it off me!&quot;

&quot; Annabel, I ... I don't think I can. I've never seen anything like it.&quot; Susan tried to calm. 

&quot;What do you mean? What is it?&quot; Annabel panicked.

&quot;I mean I've never seen anything like it. Just hold still and see what does,&quot; she said as she approached again. &quot;Where is it?&quot;

&quot;Down by my left hip. It's quivering, I can feel it! Oh my god what is it, Susan?&quot; repeated Annabel.

&quot;Honey, I think it's Chris's enchantment, the physical representation of it anyway. It looks like a moving tattoo, a cartoon on your skin. Can you lift up your dress so I can see?&quot;

&quot;Okay okay!&quot; Annabel tried to gather courage before she slowly inched one side of her light blue dress up over her thighs, panties, and finally her tummy. &quot;Can you see it?&quot; She asked.

&quot;Oh my ... yes, it's alive.&quot; Susan stared, enchanted by its lifelike beauty. &quot;Annabel; he looks scared.&quot;

&quot;It's scared?! What about me?&quot; she hissed, &quot;I'm the one it's crawling all over! We don't even know what it is.&quot;

&quot;It's okay Annabel, he won't hurt you,&quot; Susan started to reach out to the dragon, intent on calming it but it took off up Annabel's chest, under her bra and up her neck. She screamed again, clawing after it as it moved, chasing it off her neck and down her arm. Cornering it. Annabel finally got a decent look at it as it made a stand on the back of her hand; nowhere else to run. They stared at each other for a full minute, mini cartoon dragon and young woman. Finally Annabel brought her other hand forward slowly, placing a single finger about an inch away from him. &quot;What are you?&quot; She breathed.

The dragon inched forward, skulking like a cat on all fours, his wings pressed against his back, and nuzzled her finger gently. A tingly warmth slowly spread from her finger, across her hand. 

&quot;Amazing,&quot; Susan breathed as Annabel grew bolder, lifting her finger to stroke down the tiny dragon's back. 

&quot;Oh my God, he's purring!&quot; Annabel chirped, her outlook about the lively tattoo completely flipped as. The dragon arched and wiggled under her touch, clearly enjoying the attention. Her heart melted instantly. He looked so real, she tried to scoop him up with her other hand, as if he was more than a tattoo. But when she looked, there he lay, now on his back in the palm of her hand, creamy belly exposed as his legs kicked in the air. &quot;He's beautiful, but Susan, how is this possible?&quot; 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
&quot;I have no idea Annabel. He's a spell. A very, very powerful spell.&quot; Susan watched him roll back over and move up Annabel's arm. This dragon looked powerful despite his stature, it made her wonder how terrifying Chris would be when he looked like this... only forty foot long. The dragon plopped down in the hollow between her neck and collarbone. Annabel reached up to stroke him, but this time he remained steadfastly in place, curled as if preparing to sleep. &quot;What does it feel like now?&quot; asked Susan.

&quot;It's like a warm feeling when he moves around, when he runs it's like a creepy crawly, but I can feel his little vibrations when he purrs. Can I keep him?&quot; she asked, not fully understanding.

Susan chuckled. &quot;Annabel, he's a spell. I don't think you could get rid of him if you tried. We'll ask Chris what it means when he wakes up.&quot;

&quot;Chris! Wake up&quot; Annabel turned, shaking his unresponsive body. &quot;He's really out of it huh? How come he's human again?&quot; 

&quot;The enchantment he cast was the most powerful I've ever felt up close; I think it drained him, so much so that the dragon retreated back inside him to rest. We'll just have to wait until he wakes up.&quot; 

&quot;He'll be okay though, right?&quot; 

&quot;I think so honey,&quot; came Susan's slightly worried response.

Annabel stubbornly pushed his shoulder, rolling him over so he was up against the back of the couch. She got up and adjusted her dress back into position then lay down next to him, wiggling into a tight spoon position. She pulled his limp arm up under her breasts, meeting Susan's watchful gaze, almost challenging her to say something. &quot;Just wake me up for dinner, okay?&quot; 

&quot;Okay sweetie,&quot; Susan comforted. She would have liked to give Annabel a hug, yet still didn't know if that was safe given her new enchantment. She got up and left the room, giving her some privacy.

Annabel sniffled a little, upset that Chris had gone to such extremes. Why couldn't he be awake to comfort her? It was small consolation that it had all been for her; a spell to protect her. He was so stupid, could have hurt himself. And now, what? Would anyone she touched, burst into flame? Annabel stroked the little dragon at her neck, calming herself. Chris shifted in his sleep, momentarily tightening his arm around her chest. He could still touch her ... of course he could.

Susan woke her later for dinner. Lillian had returned, bringing in some of her own things; and again they ordered from room service. Her professional interest noted the presentation, and yet she wasn't particularly hungry. What of her aspirations to go to cooking school? Would she still be able to pursue her own career at Chris's side? Did she even want to? 

Over dinner, she could see the way the vampire looked at her: more calculating, more careful, not venturing near. Lillian would only have a look at the beautiful tattoo dragon from a good distance away.

The little scamp was quite boisterous. He ran down her arm to look at the food on her plate, then raced up to wait by her lips when she lifted a forkful to her mouth. Eventually Annabel pleaded with him to be still, and he seemed to get the picture. Susan and Lillian couldn't help but stare, it wasn't everyday you get to see a disturbingly lifelike cartoon-tattoo. The fact that it was also curious, intelligent, and responsive wasn't lost on Susan. It was a living spell, one of only a few recorded. The implications were vast and uncharted; but she kept any misgivings to herself. They were being watched, after all.

After supper, Annabel retrieved the duvet from their bedroom. She draped it over Chris and then wormed her way underneath to again spoon with him. Still, he slept, which made her worry. It felt a bit icky to be in the same clothes for two days straight.

&quot;Ouch.&quot; Annabel muttered, feeling a prick on her palm. She brought her hand up from under the blankets to see the damage: the dragon was just looking up at her.

&quot;Was that you?&quot; Sigh. &quot;Do you even hear me?&quot; Annabel wondered to herself. He snapped his arrowhead jaw again and she felt the pricks of his tiny teeth.

&quot;Ouww, stop it!&quot; It didn't hurt much, it was more of a shock. &quot;You can hear me, understand me?&quot;

The dragon just cocked his head slightly at her, quizzically. &quot;What do I call you?&quot; she asked quietly. &quot;Chris? No that doesn't seem right does it, you're not Chris.&quot; Suddenly the dragon playfully stamped his front claws on the ground as would an excited dog. He shot off, up her arm and around her torso, racing laps round and round her body. It felt so ticklish she couldn't help but giggle and squeal, breaking away from the funk her mind had conjured up.

&quot;Stop it you little goofball,&quot; she half-laughed, half-pleaded. He retreated to her palm, expectant. &quot;Fine, you're not Chris. Something else, something fun, something clever. Let me think.&quot; She crooned down at the little dragon, stroking him softly, a character from one of her favourite childhood books came to mind. &quot;What about...now hear me out. How about Bartholomew?&quot; 

Bartholomew flopped over, presenting his tummy for a pet with his legs kicking and his tail wriggling. &quot;Bartholomew,&quot; Annabel whispered, cupping her hands around his warmth and bringing him close to her chest, comforted that a part of Chris would always be part of her now.

***

Annabel was snuggled up next to him. That was the first thing he could tell when he woke, mostly because one of her hairs was tickling his nose and he really needed to sneeze. He couldn't help it, he held most of it back but a little &quot;tttssssseeeww&quot; still came out quietly. It wasn't a very manly sneeze.

&quot;Did you just sneeze on me, babe?&quot; Annabel murmured sleepily, waking just as his body had tensed up, trying to hold it in.

&quot;Sorry Dee. It was only a little,&quot; apologised Chris.

&quot;Gross.&quot; Annabel started, then registered. He was awake. She quickly rolled to face him. &quot;Chris? Thank god you're awake, are you okay?&quot; She grabbed hold of his front and shook him a little before hugging him close.

Chris was a bit surprised at her anxious response. &quot;I'm fine Annabel. How long have I been out?&quot; He thought back to the ceremony, being overwhelmed by his desire to always protect her, feeling the energy sap out of both himself and the dragon, feeling the dragon retreat back inside. <i>'You okay buddy?'</i> he shot towards his dragon. <i>'Tired,'</i> was all he got back.

Annabel reached off the couch in the darkness, groping for her phone on the carpet. The screen blinded them both a little before she could check the time. &quot;It's 5:30am, you passed out around 3:30 yesterday afternoon. What did you do Chris? Susan said you cast a really powerful spell on me,&quot; Annabel explained.

&quot;No I didn't, well I didn't mean to anyway.&quot; Chris started, &quot;I remember I had a vision of you in my mind as I was saying the words, I could feel you reaching out to me so I tried to hold you close. Then all of a sudden I felt myself draining, I couldn't move. Man, it was scary. That's the last thing.&quot;

&quot;That must have been the spell Chris.&quot; Annabel explained, &quot;It must have cost a lot of energy.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Do you feel any different? What happened?&quot; He asked, how could he have cast a spell? He didn't know how to use magic, only the basic principles Susan had drummed into him.

&quot;Well, Lillian tried to touch me and got a really bad burn. She's ok now though.&quot; Annabel qualified before he could ask. &quot;Susan said it's a protective enchantment but there's... well you gave me... look I'll just show you.&quot; 

Annabel turned her phone back on, angling it towards her other palm so Chris could see. &quot;What is it?&quot; Chris asked.

&quot;Shh.&quot; Annabel murmured before switching to a more coaxing tone. &quot;Come on Bartholomew, don't be shy. It's your Dad.&quot; She could feel the warmth of the little dragon cautiously approaching the light.

&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Chris exclaimed when the dragon's head, snake-like neck, and wings came into view, playing across her skin. Annabel angled the light a little more to expose him. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Annabel, giggling at the now funny memory. &quot;He gave Susan and I a massive fright when we first saw him, he was lying still and we thought he was just a magic tattoo. Then he moved and I just about died!&quot; 

&quot;Bartholomew?&quot; Chris asked, the little dragon cocked his head.

&quot;I came up with that yesterday when you were asleep. Go ahead. Touch him, he likes it.&quot; 

Chris reached down and tentatively ran a finger along the dragons spine, Bartholomew wriggled in delight. &quot;That must be what I'll look like in my full form.&quot; Chris intoned, mesmerised by the moving tattoo.

&quot;Susan thinks so, that he's the physical embodiment of the enchantment you put on me. He's so funny though, running all over me. I can feel it, he's warm or tickly. You should have seen him at dinner yesterday,&quot; Annabel gushed.

&quot;Sounds like I've got some competition.&quot; Chris chuckled, hearing the adoration in her voice.

&quot;I'll still love you a little, you gave him to me after all,&quot; joked Annabel. &quot;Thanks by the way, it means a lot that you care about me this much.&quot;

&quot;Like I said, babe. I love you.&quot; Chris leaned a little to kiss her pretty button nose in the darkness. They lay on the couch in silence for a while, Chris stroking up and down her back occasionally.

&quot;I was really worried about you,&quot; whispered Annabel.

&quot;Hey, I'm fine. Okay?&quot; Chris pulled Annabel tight and shuffled a little so she was lying directly on top, he could now rub her back and sides like he knew she loved. &quot;I'll admit, it wasn't planned but now you have your little buddy there and you're my familiar. I know I'll feel better knowing he's there to protect you, even if we don't know exactly what it is he does yet.&quot; 

&quot;I guess,&quot; Annabel admitted. &quot;Just don't do it again.&quot;

&quot;What? Express my love and affection for you?&quot; Chris teased, trying to raise her spirits. &quot;Fine. Never again.&quot; He stopped rubbing her flanks, taking his hands off her body.

&quot;Chriiiiis,&quot; She whined.

&quot;Nope.&quot; 

&quot;Kiss me,&quot; she demanded in the darkness, rubbing her body on top of him, to flush out a reaction.

&quot;Uh uh.&quot; He shook his head. He was reaching his limit though; doomed to fail as soon as she had started wriggling.

&quot;Fine, I'll do it myself.&quot; There was mock exasperation thick in her voice. Reaching to cup his cheek, she brought her lips down firmly on top of his. Feeling that she had hit her target in the darkness, she quickly employed her tongue to tease his lips, coaxing him to kiss back. It didn't work instantly so she pulled her trump card, the queen of asses so to speak. Groping along down his arm, grabbing his larger hand and pulled it along until she could position it firmly on her proudest feature. In moments he was squeezing her possessively, kissing back too. She smiled against mouth, pulling back slightly to gloat.

&quot;Treachery,&quot; Chris muttered, he could almost hear her smiling in the darkness. Losing their little game was worth it to knead her springy butt. To be fair, foreplay can't count as losing.

&quot;You're defenceless against me,&quot; Annabel delighted, grinding a little as he found her other cheek on his own. They were at each other's lips in moments, kissing desperately in the darkness of early morning and blackout shades. Tongues mating against each other, sliding over lips and teeth, they sampled each other's passion. With a small moan, Annabel broke for air, he still smelt and tasted like he did when he was a dragon. It was driving her nuts, but she stopped to consider her own breath. &quot;Let me go brush my teeth Babe.&quot;

&quot;You're fine. Am I okay?&quot; Chris asked, leaning up to find her in the darkness and peppered her lips and cheeks with tiny pecks. He couldn't dare to stop now.

&quot;You taste great.&quot; Annabel replied breathily as he started trailing his little kisses towards her ear.

Chris paused, curious about Annabel's experience. &quot;Really? What do I taste like?&quot; He held his mouth slightly off her skin just below her ear, breath tickling gently. 

&quot;Don't stop!&quot; Annabel pleaded, &quot;Fine, umm... you taste and smell different after you transformed the first time. Mmmmhhh, yeah right there.&quot; Chris had found the hem of her dress and traced his finger up along her smooth leg, he was now rubbing a finger lightly over her fabric covered slit, tapping down on her outer lips in a light rhythm as he teased her temped pussy. &quot;It....mmmm, you smell wood-smokey, kinda spicy. Your skin tastes like that, I think it's just mostly the smell though. But your uhhh, fluids are stronger, sweeter and hot too, like subtle chilli and cinnamon. It doesn't burn me though. I love it.&quot; She tried to get it all out before she lost her mind to his teasing mouth and fingers.

Chris chuckled a little into her neck. &quot;Thanks Dee, I love the way you taste too you know, and that damn vanilla perfume you use is enough to get me a bit hard whenever I smell it. Especially when it gets mixed up with your sweat or when you're wet. I love that smell too babe, your taste even more.&quot; All this time he had worked his hand into position, pulling aside her now moist panties he split her tiny inner lips and slowly inserted his index finger into her tight, slippery vagina. &quot;This taste.&quot; He breathed as she bucked backward, forcing more inside her with a moan.

He paused to kiss the skin on her delicate neck a little more, he thought briefly that a flash of warmth crossed under his lips but he couldn't be sure what it was. He was painfully erect inside his jeans, he realised he even still had his shoes on. Annabel had had enough of his teasing kisses though. She pushed him down into the couch with her smaller body, taking his face in her hand so she could control their kissing. As she happily shoved her tongue against his, driving both of them into his mouth with a moan, she twitched her hips, fucking back onto his single finger. It was great, Chris had big fingers, but it wasn't enough to get her off soon. Therefore it was just frustrating. Her arousal was peaking and now she needed the real thing inside her again. Squishing her feverish pussy onto his hand just wasn't going to cut it.

&quot;Get your pants off.&quot; Annabel ordered, breaking their kiss.

&quot;But wh – &quot; he started to tease her, unaware she had reached such state of need.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; she hissed back, forcing his hand away from her pussy, scrabbling at his belt and zipper, desperate for him. Soon enough, with some awkward help from Chris, his jeans and briefs were trapping him around his knees. She only spared a moment to grab his erection, pulling it up between them roughly.

&quot;Dee, I'm sorry. What's wrong?&quot; 

Annabel mashed her lips back down on his for a few seconds in reassurance. &quot;Nothing. Just get this dress off me.&quot; He tried to help but she slapped him away, realising she could do it better by herself in the darkness. Her bra was off in three seconds flat and her long hair spilled down over her beasts, tickling a little. Rolling onto her side, she pulled her white panties down and she was nude.

Now it suddenly felt like she had all the time in the world. &quot;Sorry Chris. I'm just really excited, I think it's still the pheromones, only weaker this time. Can we just do it right now? Okay?&quot; She rolled back on top gently, positioning herself over his groin. Bartholomew chose that moment to remind her of his presence, running excitedly around her tummy, dangerously close to her mound.

&quot;Won't hear me complaining,&quot; Chris said, running his hands up her sides and over her smooth belly, brushing the undersides of her small breasts. He felt a small pinprick and pulled his hand back, startled. &quot;Something pricked me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Bartholomew bites,&quot; she panted, reaching down to position his throbbing rod. He felt so thick and angry in her small hand, dividing her slick inner lips. Then she was slowly pushing down.

&quot;Fffffaaaauuuuck.&quot; 

&quot;Gghhhaaaa!&quot; Came their combined groans as his cockhead slipped inside her, sinking further and further as Annabel continued to sit, her hands now propping her upright on his chest. She was so warm and tight around him, Chris could only gape like a beached fish as she swallowed him up. It felt amazing, absolutely perfect to be inside of her again. For her part, Annabel loved the way he filled her, stretching her open but with so much more pleasure than their first time. They took it slow, Annabel sinking herself onto him over the course of about a minute. She was plenty wet but didn't want to rush, savouring the feeling of being so close. He supported her, guiding her down as she took him all the way in her warm depths in one deliciously slow stroke.

As she finally felt her ass lightly touch his thighs she squished herself down further, huffing when he bumped her cervix. &quot;Fuck, Chris! That's so frickin' deep, just hold still a sec,&quot; she panted.

&quot;T ... t ... taaake your time, babe,&quot; he stuttered. Just being fully inside her had him rushing toward an embarrassing finish. &quot;God you're amazing, Annabel. You feel so good, I never want to stop.&quot; He ran a hand up to her chest, stroking and tweaking her nipple gently. He reached with both hands and held her pert, cupcake tits lovingly, feathering around her small areolas to feel the little bumps. Her nipples tightened further so he gave another soft pinch again, hitching her ragged breath.

&quot;Don't....&quot; she moaned, rocking her hips slightly. Ready, she forced herself off him about two inches before letting her own weight impale her quickly. &quot;Don't ever stop.&quot;

&quot;Never.&quot; Chris brought both hands to her hips, gripping to help lift her as they established their slow rhythm. Grinding together on the down stroke, moaning desperately as they pulled apart, only to huff or whimper as they fully mated together again and again.

Annabel loved being on top like this, in control of their pace and angle. He stuffed her so completely when she sat on his rock hard cock, its broad helmet bumping her deepest spots. She twisted her hips in little circles with him all the way inside. It felt delightful to stretch herself like that, feel the warm friction everywhere as her belly clenched automatically, squeezing him. 

Her juices were slick on his invading shaft, slowly working down onto his hairless balls and seeping into his butt crack. Now they made squishy, nasty noises when their sexes met and her pubes were a humid, manicured shrubbery. Moaning, she managed to catch herself from being too loud; but Chris hissed and growled, thrust up into her body, pulling her down onto him. It was quickly taking its toll on her.

His cock jumped whenever she ground down onto him, he felt it bump her insides and twitch appreciatively. She felt so unbelievably good, so hot and wet. Her tight pussy gripped him every time he pulled out for a new thrust; she was doing it on purpose. How had she gotten that idea? He couldn't help himself as he used his own position to help them make love, bucking his tingling, slick erection right up into her beautiful snatch.

Annabel took everything he had and loved every second. Pleasure racked her body with each thrust, each muffled slap of their bodies joining was accompanied by a little huff or a whimper. Hands writhing on his shirted chest, she couldn't help scrabble and scratch at him, feeling his powerful muscles tense and flex as she rode him hard. The beautiful creature below her in the darkness was hers to love, hers to fuck. Annabel's clit fired shocks of delight up her body as it hit his pubis while her deepest recesses built a slow burning crescendo whenever his thick glans filled her completely. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
&quot;Fuck! So good, I'm gonnn... nhhhaaaaa!.. I'm gonna cum. Chris!&quot; she squealed as he thrust powerfully from below, their strokes longer and more erratic.

&quot;I'm close too, Dee.&quot; Chris gritted through his teeth, past slowing now, couldn't hold off if he wanted to. Now, he could only fuck her well and hope she met him at the finish.

Her legs were getting a little shaky, so she made the mistake of repositioning, reaching behind, supporting her on his thighs now. Chris never missed a beat, helping her raise herself and then pumping up with his powerful legs. Their new position arched her body beautifully, pushing his cock along her fluttering pussy's front wall. He felt her tense and quiver, building so quickly with the new stimulation.

&quot;Nnnnggg! Yes!... Yes! I think that's my Geeee!&quot; Annabel wailed.

Chris couldn't respond, only bury himself to the hilt in her incredible pussy, their bodies bouncing together. Sinking deep inside her warmth, his balls had long since pulled up against his shaft, ready to release their torrent. With his hands guiding her hips, he only wished he could tweak her beautifully sensitive nipples again, but it was too late. He teetered on the edge with this last few thrusts, feeling his dick throb delightfully, impossibly, swell and harden further.

&quot;Heee's bitinnnnggg meeeeeeee!&quot; Annabel screamed, her climax roaring though her body as Chris's girth hit her g-spot one last time and Bartholomew sunk tiny sharp teeth into her right nipple. She arched back, sitting down hard, fully impaling herself and bucking desperately as her body shook. Cumming almost violently, her eyes squeezed tightly shut as pleasure wracked her body. 

&quot;Annnnnabellll!&quot; Chris's cock erupted inside her, massive pulses of viscous cum splattering deep inside. Her tummy jumped and clenched as she felt his hot seed shoot off, she acknowledged each squirt with an attractive little yelp, inundated with bliss. Chris held her twitching body down, pumping all he had at the gate of her womb. She accepted it all as her own joy leaked to soil the couch. 

&quot;Yes! So fucking good!&quot; she managed in a strangled cry. Her pussy coaxed and he gave one final, magic infused spurt. Her whole body jumped as he fired his last shot, quaking in the aftermath of her orgasm.

He didn't think he had the strength but managed to pull Annabel to his chest. She lay unresponsive, shaking a little, her breath hitching into his t-shirt whenever an aftershock rolled through. His softening penis was still inside her but seemed to be maintaining enough blood to stay for a while. He ran hands over her back, teasing out her long, damp, brown locks, soothing her, and appreciating her sweaty, lithe, womanly body. Then he heard a broken little sob and his heart almost stopped.

Chris desperately reached to cup her face, putting her hair back behind her ears and smothering her with kisses. &quot;Annabel, please! What's wrong?&quot;

She gave a quiet hiccup, &quot;Oh Chris, nothing's wrong. I never thought it would be like that. I don't even know why I'm crying. I'm just so happy.&quot;

&quot;Well thank fuck,&quot; he muttered, wrapping his arms around her and pulling the duvet back up over them.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Annabel apologised as she dried her face on his t-shirt. &quot;It's stupid but I can't help it.&quot;

&quot;I love you Annabel,&quot; Chris assured.

&quot;I know. That's why I'm so happy,&quot; she said, gradually getting over her overwhelming emotions. &quot;Hey, let's go have a shower.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I mean we better clean up before Susan and Lillian get up. I hope they didn't hear us. We were quiet, right?&quot;

&quot;Well I tried to be, but you were pretty loud,&quot; she giggled, still titillated by his half-soft cock inside her.

&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Chris shot back, pinching her superb ass. &quot;You're practically a screamer.&quot;

&quot;I am not!&quot; Annabel shrieked happily, grabbing his abusing hands and pushing them up above his head. Now he was disarmed so she leaned down to kiss him, rubbing her lips teasingly over his before accepting his probing tongue for a while. &quot;Besides,&quot; she breathed, &quot;it's your fault. Your spell decided to latch onto my tit right when I came. I couldn't help it.&quot;

&quot;Nice work buddy,&quot; Chris laughed. &quot;See? My boy Bartholomew's got my back.&quot;

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Annabel slapped his chest lightly, releasing his hands. &quot;Let's go shower, it'll probably take half an hour just to get all your stuff out of me. It's so thick and it felt like you shot a pint or something.&quot;

&quot;Umm. Sorry?&quot; Chris replied a little sheepishly, stroking a finger down her arm, making her shudder a little. He knew it certainly wasn't a pint but he loved how powerful his ejaculations seemed now. Clearly, parts of his dragon's prowess transferred back to his human form, permanently altered. The feel of his creamy seed jetting out deep inside her while his erection jumped with each shot, unbelievably good, especially without a condom. Not only due to the extra feeling, but because his dragon mind told him it meant he was breeding her. <i>Breeding her.</i>

&quot;Don't be,&quot; Annabel smiled. &quot;It feels amazing when you cum in me, so hot, I can feel how hard it shoots out. Then there's the fact that it seems to make my orgasms better or just make me cum all over again. I can still feel it now, it's still so tingly and warm inside me... Magic. Honestly Chris, how is a girl supposed to have a fair chance against you?&quot;

&quot;Maybe you aren't,&quot; Chris mused. &quot;Alright go, I'd die if Mom saw us like this.&quot;

Annabel pulled up, feeling his semi-soft penis slide out of her, inducing a little shudder of pleasure. She had her hand ready to catch whatever cum would no doubt flood out but it mostly stayed inside her as his wet dick slapped down on his belly. <i>It's so sticky it won't even drain out of me properly, what a nightmare to clean,</i> she mused. Although, it did feel quite delightful inside her, spreading warmth and little twitches up into her abdomen and belly. <i>Whatever, if I can't get pregnant until he bites me then he can shoot me up all he wants.</i> Annabel thought happily to herself, searching in the couch for her discarded cloths.

They eventually retreated back to their bedroom, using the lavish, tiled bathroom to clean off the last days' sweat and worries, together.

Lillian just sighed as she sat on the floor with her back to the wall. Her bedroom door was just cracked. Their smell was thick in the air, their noisy, clumsy, loving sex was in the air. His smell was thickest, his rich blood and potent seed, rumoured to make the average female Being cream on the spot. The human girl had no inkling what she had deep in her womb at that second, the strength and magical power she would be infused with as it was absorbed by her body. An ounce would sell for thousands of dollars, far more valuable than gold. Only seven sources in the entire world.... If vampire bait existed, he was it: the ultimate temptation, blood and sex, beyond one's wildest dreams, wrapped up in a powerful, handsome, adorable, inexperienced, bumbling, boy-dragon. He would definitely need her protection, but then again why not just keep him for herself? Her dangerous, parasitic urges demanded it.

Sighing again, she gingerly extracted two guilty digits from her soaked pussy, avoiding her over-sensitised clit but running wet fingers over her hairless, puffy lips and mound teasingly. &quot;Way to let him not get to you, Lillian,&quot; she berated herself, looking over to her bedside table several feet away. She magically plucked out a few tissues, levitating them toward her. As she cleaned herself up, she could only hope the dragon was too naive to scent her pleasure and frustration.

<i>There, I hope you enjoyed it. Please give me some feedback.</i>

<i>Just a warning, the next chapter has an incest focus. It's fair to say that it's been strongly alluded to. I know this isn't some people's cup of tea and as a result, I'll probably be putting it in the I/T category when I eventually post it. Anyway, if you miss it as a result but are still interested in reading the story sections, it'll be waiting for you when I post Chapter 5 back in SF/F. It's certainly not going to be the focus from now on. </i>

<B> Chapter 4 – LTPC</B>

<I>Hi everyone,

Our adventure starts to unfold a little more.

However, this chapter does contains soft-core incest. I understand that this is distasteful to some people so either stop reading right here or cover your eyes with your hand and say "LALA LA LA LA LA!" while scrolling down the page when the action starts. This relationship will be a recurring theme, but certainly not the focus of the story.

Sorry about the wait on this one, I have a new editor for this chapter, Etaski. I cannot stress enough how amazing Etaski's support in my time of editorial crisis has been. Thank you.

Stay tuned and I hope you enjoy.

Chris pondered the recent changes to his not-all-that human body as he operated the stovetop espresso machine he'd found in the kitchen. During his shower with Annabel, he'd decided to re-establish his ritual of morning coffee delivery to Susan, now he was just brooding as he waited for it to boil up. 

He might look human, but he barely felt it. He'd gone for a razor only to find his face absolutely smooth, not a trace of prickly stubble. Annabel hadn't minded, teasing him for having a baby face till he kissed her into submission. It also still looked like he'd just had a fresh Hollywood wax, no navel or armpit hair either. On close inspection even the tiny hairs all over his body where absent.

When he'd gotten back into their bedroom and decided to do his morning exercises, starting with push ups he discovered that they were just a joke. For the first time in his life, he'd managed the fabled one arm push up, then asked Annabel to push down on his shoulders as he tried again. It barely required any effort.

His smell and hearing were still enhanced, but his vision was back to human standards. It was all a bit disconcerting, to be walking around in a body he thought he knew, at least when in his half form he had constant reminders not to break things, like the unfortunate mug he'd first gotten out of the cupboard.

The rumbling stovetop got his mind back on track, he poured, adding both milk and sugar, stirring with a spoon that felt like it came from a kid's tea set. Slipping into Susan's room silently and closing the door, he put it down on the bedside table before sitting next to his mother on the bed.

Susan's raven hair was spread across the pillows and around her face. Her slightly more pronounced upper lip meant her mouth was always just a little open when she was relaxed, he thought it was beautiful. It struck Chris, as he watched her peaceful features, that this woman had devoted her entire life to him. He owed her so much and promised himself he would repay her, make a life for her where she could be happy now that he didn't need her to be his protector any longer.

As if feeling his promise, indeed, between Beings such charged feelings can often be detected, Susan's eyes opened and flicked to him and she found herself being watched by a very serious looking Chris. 

"Good morning, honey," Susan croaked. "You're okay after last night? You had me worried." She sniffed the air and saw the cup on the bedside stand. "Mmmhh... is that my coffee? I'd really hoped you'd keep pampering me."

She sat up and took a sip but something was wrong. He didn't reply, just kept holding their blue-eyed gaze. It was very intense, made her tummy flutter a little. Susan couldn't stand it.

"What is it Chris? What's up?" she asked, settling on her knees next to him.

"Mom..." he started. "Susan. I owe you so much I can't even comp.."

"Sweetie, you don't owe me anything. I love you." Susan was a little exasperated. Already his sweet odor was exciting her, helping her wake up better than the coffee could.

"Let me finish. Please?" 

"Okay." She yawned, wiping some sleep away and stretching her arms up, giving him a little teasing look at her nipples pressed against cloth.

Watching her in her old t-shirt and flannel bottoms, Chris was momentarily distracted by her little show and some midriff before he got back on topic.

"I..." he sighed. "Susan, you were only twenty-three when my parents died. You didn't have to care for me yourself, heck, you could probably have sold me for a fortune. But you didn't. You became my mother and raised me in isolation. It must have been so hard at times and I'm sorry you had to do it alone."

Susan held his eyes for as long as she could before her own started brimming with tears; she turned away.

<I>Why am I so emotional around him these days? </I>she thought, trying to get herself back under control. He wasn't wrong, it had been hard, but seeing him now growing into a man made it all worth it. Now her body was telling her to pluck the fruits of her labour, her mind seemed incapable of mounting any real resistance.

Chris pulled her gently into a sitting hug, automatically rubbing her back. "Sorry, Mom, don't cry."

"Okay." Susan sniffed into his neck. "I'm a mess, huh?"

There was his tantalising smell again, tickling her nostrils, insidiously working onto her lungs. Her emotions raged against each other; she wanted so badly to just kiss his skin but would it be wrong? They were all each other had for so long, loved each other so deeply. Susan wanted more from him, to remain part of his new life rather than fade into the background as he went out and experienced it.

"You're fine," Chris soothed. "I guess what I was trying to say is that you devoted fifteen years of your life to me, but now that I've awakened I want you to do whatever you want. You can go back to your family, open your own plant nursery or herbarium, anything. We'll make it happen; you don't have to live your life around me anymore."

Susan listened but couldn't bare it any longer. She turned her head and feathered her lips on the top of his shoulder, hoping he wouldn't notice what she was doing. It only made the desire worse and by the time Chris finished speaking she had reached his neck and was pressing more firmly.

Chris froze as she started kissing up his neck, towards his ear. It felt great but so dangerous at the same time. So forbidden.

"Mom?" he breathed as she started across his jaw, and her goal became clear.

"Shhhh," Susan soothed between her little kisses. At the edge of his mouth she paused, breathing deeply, her body shuddered a little. "You said I can do anything, did you mean it?"

"Yes, but..."

Her lips intercepted his. It was such a gentle, exploratory kiss, clumsy even, but it took both of their breaths away instantly. Susan opened her eyes as she teased his lower lip between her two; he was watching her, eyes open as love and anxiety played across his face. She broke away just an inch, the hand that had worked its way into his short, blond hair came down to cup his cheek.

"Let me stay with you, like this," she pleaded, desperate for their love to survive this metamorphosis. He had been her life for so long; this would only intertwine them further.

Her lips had set his body tingling, so soft and loving. Her beautiful, tear-streaked face told him this was what she truly wanted. He realized he could easily love her this way too.

"Mom, I..."

"Susan."

"Susan." Chris sighed, watching her eyes intently. They seemed hopeful yet sad and oh-so-vulnerable. "I do love you, maybe even a little like this already."

He accentuated his point by stroking her flank up to the underside of her full, unsupported breast. Pausing to watch her, his thumb played lovingly across her tatty old t-shirt just below her left boob.

"But?" Susan asked forlornly. She loved his hand on her like that but it was a cruel tease if he wouldn't let her be with him.

"Annabel. I can't cheat on her, Mom. Then there's the fact that this feels like a whisper away from incest.""Chris, please, you're a dragon now. I want to be part of that. And, there's no legal way it could be incest. Couldn't we just talk about it with Annabel?"

"I don't know if I'm ready for this, Susan, my dragon really wants to but it's a big step for me. It's not that I don't want to, Lord knows I've fantasised about it sometimes." He blushed at that confession, especially when her eyes brightened. "But people talk, I'm not comfortable enough with myself or where I stand in this world to deal with people judging me for incest." 

"I'm not your mother," Susan said a little bitterly. "I may as well be stranger you met on the street yesterday, that's how related we are."

"It's not that, you'll always be my mother."

But he couldn't stand the hurt look she gave him so he relented, pulling her back to his lips.

It was most definitely the wrong thing to do.

Susan was more forceful this time, taking advantage of his invitation; her tongue slipped into his mouth after a few seconds of resistance. She moaned when she got a real taste of him, spicy and a little sweet, heady with magic.

Soon Chris couldn't help but reciprocate as his own beautiful mother plundered his mouth. He felt a little insecure that it was all just the effects of being a dragon, but then he remembered that it couldn't create feelings out of nothing; it could only enhance them. Besides, he knew Susan loved him, although this was certainly an unexpected aspect of her love. So instead of doubting this and pulling back, he flicked his tongue languidly against hers before taking control of their kiss and exploring her mouth, loving her groan of approval.

A few minutes later, Chris found himself kissing down Susan's neck and nuzzling into her long, rich, black hair. She always smelled floral, using whatever she grew in her own perfumes or soaps. At the moment it was a light jasmine, exquisitely combined with her natural body odor and thick arousal. She was cooing as he kissed her, flushed across her neck and breasts. Chris's one-track mind flashed ahead to imagine what delightful sounds she would make while he teased her slick womanhood. He almost reached down to find out but reason and whatever remained of his human decency stopped him.

"Susan," he panted, sitting up so his forehead was against hers.

"What?" she asked, a little frustrated that he'd stopped.

"If we do this, I gotta' take it slow. And we have to talk to Annabel, like, right now."

Susan opened hopeful eyes to find him watching her yet again. "We're doing it, though, right?" 

"Oh, yea." Chris smiled back; he was beyond the point of no return.

Susan just tackled him back onto the bed with a girlish squeal, laying her chest down on top of him and kissing all around his mouth. "Thank you, Chris!" she tittered. "I was so worried you wouldn't let me."

Chris rolled her off him, lying on his back and staring up into the ceiling. <I>What have I done? My own mother, I 'm seducing my own goddamn mother, </I>he thought.

<I>You love it, </I>teased the dragon weakly.

<I>Shut up! </I>Chris shot back but right then his erection twitched. He looked down to find his sweatpants tented and a slight wet patch where the head pressed up into the grey material and his precum had leaked.

Susan watched him, knew that some part of him was struggling.

"Hey," she assured. "It's going to be fine, Chris. I don't think I've told you this before but do you remember the two Werecat women who came to your parents' house all the time? You loved to play with them, I think you even pulled one of their tails once. There was a young vampire, too. Anyway, they were your father's partners."

"Sarah and Margret??!" Chris couldn't believe it.

"Oh, yeah." Susan giggled, "You could hear them going at it out in the guest house, especially when the girls were in heat."

"She was the one who took the vampire in the first place. She'd been abused but ended up falling in love with your father."

"No way. And Marie, my mother knew?" It was such a foreign concept, being raised as a human had ingrained him with social mores not befitting his species.

"You didn't ever..?" Chris asked tentatively.

"No," Susan assured. "I mean, your father was very attractive but I was there to look after you. Besides, he had is plate full and I was intimidated by him. I was only 21 when I started working for them, you were just two and a half."

"Wow." Chris sighed, the vision of his mother and father's relationship somewhat in tatters. "I guess I'll go get Annabel so we can talk. This is going to go down a treat."

"I think she'll be fine, Chris." Susan sat up as he got to his feet.

"Oh, hey, Dee," Chris practiced in a sarcastic singsong voice, "Mom and I were just making out a bit in her room, you're all good with that right?" 

Susan couldn't help but laugh.

"Fuck my life," he mumbled as he started boldly for the door.

***

He ended up just peeking his head out of Susan's room, hiding his flagging erection behind the door. Annabel was in the kitchen with Lillian, about to start making breakfast for them.

"Annabel," Chris called weakly. "Can you come in here for a bit?"

"Sure, babe, I was just about to start on breakfast. Is Susan up?"

"Yeah," Chris mumbled. 

As Annabel entered the room she could tell something was off. For one, Chris kept his distance and didn't touch her like he might usually. Secondly, neither of them would look her in the eye. Then she realized Susan was decidedly flushed and in a strange place on the bed. Her eyes flashed back to her boyfriend and she spotted the little wet patch by on his pants and a very guilty look on his face. It all clicked.

"Already, Chris? We had sex like... like an hour ago!" Annabel huffed. She was jealous but, to her own surprise, not furious. Annoyed would better describe how she felt.

"I'm sorry, Annabel, it... I didn't mean... Look, it just happened, alright? I love you both and I stopped so we could all talk about it before it went any further." Chris moved closer to Annabel, hoping she wouldn't pull away.

"I started it, Annabel. I kissed him," Susan said from the bed. "I begged for him to let us be lovers. Don't be mad at him."

"No, Susan, that's no excuse. I wanted it too," Chris confessed.

"I'm not <I>that </I>mad." Annabel said a little more calmly. "Look, it's a bit of a shock. I can't say I'm happy about it at the moment but we talked about this the other night. You're a dragon and you are supposed to have a 'brood,' I just didn't expect it to happen so quickly. It's like you're interrupting my honeymoon."

"You're not...?" Chris began incredulously. He was either the luckiest guy on the planet or she was plotting an overly elaborate revenge. "You don't care that it's incest?"

"It's not really incest," Susan and Annabel said in unison, then couldn't help but burst into laughter.

"Jinx," Annabel joked but Susan shut up right away. Perhaps witches had some greater respect for the word. "I guess I'm a bit disappointed but you still love me, right? You still want to be with me?"

"Always. That's a promise."

"Then it's... okay. No matter what else happens. I said that, didn't I?" Annabel answered, swallowing visibly, still a bit miffed. "I also remember something about bridges." She closed the gap and wrapped her arms around Chris. "Well, here's me crossing it."

He was in shock.

"You're incredible," he mumbled into her hair, kissing the top of her head.

He was in absolute awe of his girlfriend, who was clearly more adaptable than he was. It seemed so farfetched, so inconceivable, there had to be something else going on; it was almost magical.

"I'm so sorry you even need to be exposed to this."

"Well, if it's part of the package, I'll deal with it. Besides if there's anyone who deserves your love even close to as much as I do, it's her," Annabel reasoned, trying to let the angst flow out of her. 

Susan sat mute on the bed, unable to make a single sound. She opened her mouth like a fish, tried to talk but nothing worked.

"Just let's talk about it all before you do anything too serious," Annabel continued.

"Absolutely, I want to take it slow," Chris assured. "It's a big change for us to make. We were only kissing." He paused."Well, to be honest it got pretty heavy and it could have easily gone further.""That's okay. I think. Look, just don't have sex without asking me alright?"

Chris just hugged her tighter, so grateful she was this forgiving.

"This might be weird," Annabel murmured, hugging him back, "but do you think I could be there when you guys make out? I mean, I want to see if I'm actually okay with it rather than the idea of it. Does that make any sense?"

"Yea, I think that might be a good idea. We can go at a pace everyone's comfortable with... Thank you so much, Annabel. I couldn't stand to lose you." A massive weight seemed to lift from his shoulders. She was going to be okay.

"Susan?" Annabel asked. "Are you okay with that?"

Getting no reply, they turned to look at Susan, who was gesticulating a little too urgently that she couldn't speak.

"Jeez, Susan, it was just a joke. I release you," Annabel said teasingly.

"How did you do that!?" Susan gasped, clutching her throat.

"What?" 

"That spell, how did you stop me talking?!" Susan rushed off the bed, pulling Annabel out of Chris's arms and shaking her a little.

"A spell? I didn't... I just said jinx. It's a joke," Annabel replied, frightened at Susan's harsh reaction.

Annabel's skin started to feel dangerously warm to Susan. She quickly took a step back, holding her arms up in a peaceful gesture, trying to placate the hidden little dragon which clearly saw her as a threat. Thankfully, she'd understood its warning, making Annabel's skin hot, before it did anything to her like it had to Lillian.

"I'm sorry Annabel, I didn't mean to scare you but it was quite disconcerting to be silenced. My god, it's actually using magic on your behalf..."

"What's going on?" Chris was very confused.

"When she said jinx, I really couldn't make a sound. Her tattoo, it's powerful and complex." Susan looked at Annabel, musing. "Somehow you must have thought that I couldn't talk and the dragon just did what you wanted it to."

"What?!" Annabel exclaimed. "But I didn't feel anything, it was just a joke."

"That's cool," commented Chris, sweeping Annabel back into an embrace. Bartholomew poked his head from under her sleeve, then trotted down to her wrist. 

"Did you do that?" Annabel asked, a little scared of the unpredictable enchantment.

The dragon puffed some purple smoke out nose in the affirmative.

"Please, Bartholomew, Susan is a friend, I only want you to help her or protect her. The same goes for Lillian, the vampire. Okay?" Annabel begged the tiny tattoo.

"It might not be as simple as that," Susan considered. "He's a living spell, intelligent, and clearly able to go well beyond simply protecting Annabel. I hate to say this but we should show him to Lady Narlakis sometime today, she's probably the most powerful spellweaver in the Americas and she's got millennia of experience."

"Wait. Can I do magic now?" Annabel asked excitedly.

"I don't know, Annabel, you certainly did something to stop me talking. If you can learn to control and work with the spell, maybe. That's just speculation though, don't try at the moment."

On the one hand, it could be very dangerous to attempt magic without understanding the fundamentals. On the other hand, Susan wasn't sure the fundamentals even applied to Annabel. She was using the dragon's magic rather than her own.

"I promise not to try but I honestly didn't mean to silence you, Susan, it was out of my control." Annabel was worried but so excited at the same time. "Thank you, Chris! You don't know how much Bartholomew means to me, I won't just be a human familiar if I can do some magic or have a protective enchantment. I'll be relevant, right, Susan?"

"Well, you'll certainly be unique, a bit of a shock to the system so to speak." Susan watched a little hopefully as Chris embraced Annabel, wanting to be close to him too. She honestly had no idea where Annabel would fit in now. A human infused with a living spell which appeared to be somewhat under her control... it was unheard of.

--------------------------------------------
Chris beckoned Susan closer till he could wrap her under an arm. The two women assessed each other with their heads resting inches apart on either side of his broad chest as they hugged him back. Looking down at the slightly shorter woman, Annabel saw the happiness in her blue eyes as Susan accepted his embrace, rubbing her cheek into his pectoral and pushing her entire body against him.

She knew that heady feeling and gave Susan a little nod of approval. She would share him, share the happiness he could bring. It would be cruel to deny her that happiness when it was so clearly what she needed.

"Thank you," Susan whispered; her eyes brimmed with happy tears. "I'll take it as slow as you want and you can be there if that's what you need."

Chris nuzzled the top of his girlfriends' head first, kissing her scalp before moving to the raven hair of his mother and repeating the process. His dragon gave a weak purr of happiness in his mind as they turned their faces up in unison. Annabel came first, receiving a few seconds of gentle kissing. Neither of them pushed their tongues further than the others lips but it was very loving, intimate, a reassurance of their feelings.

Once they parted Chris leaned down to Susan who, was patiently waiting her turn and pushed up on her toes to meet him. Their kiss was slow but more passionate, their tongues dancing softly against each other, an expression of their newly acknowledged desires.

"Oh, I could get used to that," Susan breathed as Chris broke their kiss.

"You haven't seen anything yet," Annabel warned happily.

It had been something else to watch them kiss. Weird, but also hot. Their obvious loving desire only cemented that she was doing the right thing, maybe not by the human world's standards but they weren't in the human world. Perhaps it was just another magical side effect of his proximity and his recent, very satisfying bedding, but she was starting to almost feel good about this.

"I love you both so much," Chris murmured, squeezing their soft bodies closer for a second.

"I love you, too," came a disjoined, mixed reply from both women.

"No jinx," Annabel qualified, they both giggled a little uncertainly.

"Okay, what are we going to do today?" Chris asked.

"I need clothes," Annabel said. "These ones are smelly and I don't have any changes."

"We should go see Lady Narlakis," Susan said. "She might even know by now when we'll go to see Lord Guthrie."

"I wanted to go see the magic district and set up my new gadgets. We can do all that today can't we?" Chris asked.

"Yeah, and let's set aside about hrrrm... two hours of dedicated petting time." Susan laughed.

"Deal," Annabel confirmed.

"I'm in trouble aren't I?" Chris asked with fake worry, guiding them both out towards the living room, one beautiful, loving woman held close in each arm.

"Absolutely," Annabel replied.

***

Lillian was about when they emerged. Susan inwardly cursed herself; the vampire had probably heard everything they'd just discussed. She blushed a little before remembering that the entire apartment was bugged, Lady Narlakis already knew about her planned conquest of Chris. She supposed there wasn't a way of hiding it, really, and she wanted an open, public relationship with him anyway, but had hoped to keep it discreet for a while.

Deciding to throw caution to the wind, Susan sat next to Chris at the kitchen bar and pulled him into a brief, rather un-motherly kiss before scooting closer and cuddling up, even giving the watchful vampire a little nod. Annabel, who'd just started on making them all omelettes, smiled ruefully.

Lillian <I>had </I>heard their discussion and saw Susan's kiss for what it was: an announcement. That wasn't a problem for her, outside of a harshly quashed twinge of jealousy, but she looked to the human girl to see her reaction.

Annabel seemed to be okay with it. Interesting. Lillian had heard tell male dragons were notorious for developing cherished "broods" of willing females. They somehow always seemed to get along without any major catfights despite the strong, powerful women involved. There must be something magical at work. Lillian couldn't fathom sharing a man like that; her vampiric nature was too possessive and greedy.

Annabel interrupted the vampire's thoughts. "Can we open the blinds, Lillian? It would be nice to see some sunlight in here... sorry."

"That's fine Annabel, just give me a second."

Lillian closed her eyes and muttered a well practiced incantation, one of the only ones most vampires ever bothered with. Over the next few seconds her tall body faded from view, jeans, black long sleeve, jacket, boots, and all.

"Okay, you can open the blinds now, it's the big switch over by the window," came the vampire's disembodied voice.

Annabel watched in disbelief and no one moved to open the blinds. A big sigh came from the direction of the vampire.

"Well, how else am I supposed to go out in the sunlight? Lillian asked as she walked over to slap the switch herself. "This way it all just passes straight through me. I wouldn't be very good at my job if I could only come out at night."

The blinds opened slowly, revealing busy morning streets and letting the bright sunlight stream in.

"Can all vampires do that?" Annabel asked, terrified by the thought of invisible blood-suckers lurking everywhere around her. She had no clue where Lillian was other than when she spoke, realising how reliant humans were on their vision.

"Most do, eventually." Lillian said, enjoying Annabel's distress a little. "It usually takes around two hundred years for young vampires to grow powerful enough to pull it off, though, it's the biggest milestone in a vampire's life."

"How old are you?" Annabel asked.

"Tut tut, Annabel," Lillian whispered from behind her. "That's a bit rude" 

Annabel squealed, bolting around the counter into Chris's embrace.

"That's enough, Lillian," Chris said firmly, addressing the presence he felt leaning against the stove.

"You can see her?" Annabel asked tentatively, peaking towards where he was looking but seeing nothing.

"No, but I can feel her presence, as well as hear and smell her."

"So can I," said Susan. "But it's not very exact for me. If you were a Were, I think you could still smell and hear her, although she's pretty quiet."

"Don't tease Annabel, Lillian. It's dangerous now, she already burned you and silenced Susan this morning." He knew the vampire was just having a little fun but it set his tired dragon on edge to have his First feel threatened in any way. 

"Don't remind me." Lillian grimaced, testing her re-grown hand. It was pretty much back to its original state, but perhaps she would feed tonight. "I'm sorry to scare you, it was just a little fun and I couldn't help myself."

"That's ok," Annabel cautiously returned to the heating pan. "Just try not to scare me too much. I asked Bartholomew not to hurt you but he seems to do his own thing." She began preparing the omelettes again but suddenly hesitated. "I'm not going to bump into you am I."

"I'll get out of the way," Lillian chuckled. "I'm almost five hundred by the way. We grow more powerful as we age, and I have my telekinesis, but we always struggle with magic."

***

They ended up agreeing to get some clothes for Annabel first. She'd insisted on it, given it was the start of day three for her underwear. 

An invisible Lillian made a phone call to Oslo, a very large, shaggy man who would be their visible protection while they were out. Oslo was a Werebear, a grizzly. Lillian always liked him because he was quiet, observant, and generally didn't seem to give a shit. That, and he was never sniffing around her proverbial skirts like some of the other men she worked with. Adversaries sometimes mistook him to be dim, but that was their undoing.

He'd knocked on their door about half an hour later and Lillian introduced him. Chris had returned his crushing handshake with equal force as they sized each other up, acknowledging strength when they saw it.

Annabel was intimidated but Chris persuaded her to shake his hand, too. Oslo noticed the protectiveness and care the dragon had for her; as a family man, he respected that. He decided that he already liked the dragon.

Their mismatched party walked down the streets of the magic district, Chris and Annabel marvelling that Beings could live and work their secret lives right next to humans. It wasn't obvious but now that he knew, some things stood out a little. There were no chain or franchise stores and there seemed to be an overabundance of slightly ... quirky shops.

People, both human and Being, identified by their auras, seemed busy and happy as they walked by. Some of the Beings sported slightly out-of-place clothing too, but it was only noticeable to the initiated. Overall it seemed vibrant, a little town nestled away inside a city, and there was literally magic in the air.

Invisible, Lillian lead them to a nearby cluster of independent stores. She explained that none of them were Being-only stores, they maintained a standard floor stock but that they would have some enchanted clothing out back. Annabel thrilled at the idea of enchanted clothes but realized she had no way of paying, only about $400 was in her account. The rest was in savings to pay for her life next year at school.

"I can help," Chris offered. "I brought plenty with me."

"Oh, but Chris, you need it--"

"It's okay, Annabel, we'll get what you need. Besides, you're my familiar now, I get to do what I want with you, don't I?" he whispered the last part directly in her ear, sending lustful, loving feelings down their magical bond.

She blushed, and it was surprisingly dark.

"What I mean is," he said aloud for everyone to hear, "I can cover the essentials for the next few days, until you can collect whatever you need back home."

"Alright. Thank you." She nodded, recovering from her flush as he held the door to the shop for her 

When they saw the prices on the items, however, they almost just walked out.

"Hey, come on, these are good prices." Lillian seemed to block the door with her voice. "And you will be expected to maintain an image among other Beings, Chris, whether you like it or not."

"You'd also be supporting local business," Susan added helpfully, smiling and patting Chris's shoulder as if to smooth over Lillian's gruffness. "That's also kind of expected among your own kind."

"You've got to be kidding." Chris kept his voice low so as not to be blaring across the shop. "That's ridiculous, I'm not going to pay three times as much for regular clothes just because someone's feelings might be hurt if I don't dress as they expect me to!"

Oslo's chuckle was about the deepest bass that any of them had ever heard, practically rumbling through the floor beneath their feet.

"But, Chris, honey," Susan began, and Lillian seemed to elbow her to get her attention.

They all looked to see Annabel fawning over a pair of jeans she obviously loved, the enthusiastic assistant having already snared her and happy to fuss over her figure until the sun set behind the mountains.

"Ah, shit," Chris muttered, as Susan and Lillian drifted over to provide support for the spree.

In the end, he and Oslo muttered condolences to each other by the door until it was time to ring it all up: two t-shirts, a mid-length black skirt, a blue tank, windbreaker, a long-sleeved, grey pullover, and three panty-bra sets. Just under a thousand dollars.

"Uh-oh," Annabel said, eyeballing the pieces as if trying to decide what to put back. The problem was that they were all the basics she would need.

"I got it, love," Chris murmured, paying the assistant before she could stop him.

She hugged him fervently as they left the store. "Thank you, these truly are the nicest clothes I've ever owned. They're made so well. But you shouldn't have spent so much."

"You're welcome, and it's fine," he assured her. "I know they'll look great on you. I'll be able to make money once I start accepting contracts through Maginet."

Lillian suggested they go find Annabel an evening dress and some shoes but that was vetoed, and they'd ended up going back to the hotel/apartment so Annabel could change and Chris could collect the small, heavy black toiletries bag containing the last of his cash and all of his gold. When he asked about a gold exchange, Lillian explained that gold was more valuable than the human currency he could get exchanging it. Besides the shops they were going to would accept gold anyway.

Annabel chose the black skirt, the blue tank, and the grey pullover, which all looked nice with her sandals. Chris lost all regrets for his money when he laid eyes on her. She was absolutely stunning, her long legs looked even creamier against the black skirt, showing a little of her sleek thighs. She'd pinned her hair so the soft, loose curls cascaded down her back. The pullover was clingy, conforming perfectly to her slim waist and slightly bulged chest, the blue tank-top just peeked out from underneath. He couldn't help but hug her when she presented herself and whisper in her ear.

"You look lovely."

They'd walked back into the district, heading toward one of Lillian's favorite stores. She always had liked to shop, even if it wasn't for herself. Buying beautiful things with someone else's money was fun, a pleasurable relic of her pampered human life so long ago. They looked for a dress first. The owner of one shop, a young witch named Mary, even looked after them herself once Lillian made herself known. Lillian was important, beautiful, and a loyal customer after all. 

The transparent vampire explained they were looking for a dress, something Annabel could wear to dinner with Lady Narlakis but also to a club with her boyfriend, pointing out Chris by the door.

"Well, what's he going to wear?" asked Mary, wondering which of her customers was wearing the delightful perfume. It was a nice, manly smell so perhaps it was of the men off to the side.

"Oh, probably just something like he is now," Annabel explained. "He loves his jeans and you'd never get him into a suit or anything like that."

"Let's find you something to force him out of the jeans, huh?" Mary chuckled.

"Good luck with that," Susan laughed.

"Okay," Annabel said meekly, she was completely out of her league in a shop like this. Sure, she looked at nice clothes in shops at home or on the internet but didn't know anything about choosing a fancy evening dress.

Mary led them into the back, and began showing off her best wares including the various enchanted clothing she'd worked on herself. Lillian made herself visible again to help Annabel choose something, as the back room was completely sunproof. 

Chris had noticed they were going out back and followed curiously, finding the women gushing over variously colored stylish numbers. Annabel was explaining that she wanted something which could be multipurpose because they could only afford one. None of the dresses even had price tags; that must be a bad sign.

"I think I have just the thing for you," Mary mused. She didn't know who Annabel was but if Lillian was with her, she must be pretty important. "This one is one of my favourites, it's silk but I've enchanted it to be durable and stain resistant. I'd still recommend you only hand-wash it but I think you'd look lovely in it, Annabel, and black is always sexy. We'll shame him into wearing something nicer."

She smiled over at Chris as she said that.

"What's wrong with this?" Chris asked, a little defensive.

Jeans, boots and a nice t-shirt or button up were his tried and true. If there was an occasion and Susan or Annabel forced him, he'd switch out the t-shirt for a nicer long-sleeve but he usually ended up rolling up the sleeves anyway. In summer he might even wear shorts if it got really hot. To be fair, he was small town, through and through.

"Oh, nothing really, but she'll look like a princess in this. You should try to look your best for her, too." Mary handed the black silk to Annabel. "Go try it on, dear, no bra though."

The silk flowed over her hand like water as she walked in to the little back-back room to change. She'd never worn anything like this, it was so shapeless she could barely figure out how it went on. She stripped out of her newly bought clothes, removed her bra, and let the silk flow down over her body. It felt delightfully cool to the touch. She looked in the mirror and gasped.

Slinky. That was the best she could come up with.

It might be a bit too lose around her chest, but it conformed to her waist and hips without clinging to them, until the hem fluttered at the middle of her thigh. It was partially backless, exposing her registration with thin shoulder straps crossing just below her shoulder blades to meet the other side of the dress below her breasts. Between the crossing straps on her back was a massive valley of exposed pale skin, travelling almost to the thinnest part of her waist. It felt like she was naked. She barely had the confidence to show the others, let alone wear it in public.

She looked for Chris as she tentatively emerged; he was already striding forwards, reaching for her with lust in his eyes. He saw she was nervous and stroked her cheek a little before leaning down for a relatively chaste kiss.

"You're ridiculously gorgeous, Dee," Chris whispered against her cheek as he stroked the bared skin of her lower back. Then he turned to Mary. "We'll take it."

He didn't care how much it cost at that point.

"Well, let me have a look at her first." Mary moving forward. "Yes, you're stunning in this, hon. Hmm, we might resize it in the chest a little, no offence. Now turn around for me."

Annabel did so slowly, exposing her back.

"You're a familiar," Mary commented as she checked the fit around Annabel's flanks. "But who's your-?"

Bartholomew took the opportunity to introduce himself then. Having previously wrapped himself around her bellybutton, he waltzed up her back to lay on her other tattoo again.

Mary jumped back quickly. "What the hell is that? A dragon? But.."

Her voice died and she wheeled on Chris.

"Guilty," he chuckled.

"Lillian, you bitch, you brought him in here and didn't tell me?!" Mary exclaimed. "Oh my god, I can't believe he's in my shop! Everyone was talking about it yesterday."

"It's not a big deal," Chris tried.

Lillian laughed at that.

"Uh, yeah, it is," Marry replied, forgetting to not be argumentative.

"Whatever, can we please get the dress?"

"Yes. Sorry. Oh, Annabel, you lucky girl, oh my god. Okay, let's pull the chest in a bit."

Mary slipped a finger under the sides and up against the surface of Annabel's breasts, muttering as the cloth shrank a little. It was still loose enough to fall away in front between where the thin straps attached, showing the soft skin between her breasts. If she'd had more there, the cleavage might have been ridiculous, but as it was it was a tantalising display of her small, well formed assets.

"Alright, let's bag that up for you."

Annabel emerged from changing back into her previous clothes a few minutes later to find Chris being persuaded into buying a pair of black slacks and a very nice light blue shirt. They eventually went to the counter to pay, and Annabel noticed Mary added a length of frilly ribbon the same colour as his new shirt but dreaded what the damage might be.

"How would you like to pay for the dress? I'd like to throw in the pants and shirt as a gift." Mary was trying her best.

"That really isn't necessary," Chris replied. It made him nervous to have the stranger doting on him like this.

"I insist, I can't part with the dress for free though, I've spent quite a while working on it."

"How about gold?" asked Chris.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
"Wouldn't you like to hold onto that? If I had you alone for a few nights, we could umm... you could help me perform some, interesting magic. It would be more than enough to..."

A few nights of spell casting with the dragon would be more than lucrative, extremely pleasurable, too, from what she'd heard. Dragons had an almost cult reputation among female Beings, which was only given more fuel by the complete lack of reliable firsthand accounts.

"I'm flattered, but no. Sorry."

Chris apologized surprisingly gracefully while Annabel was a little flustered. If she understood correctly, the woman had propositioned her own boyfriend to prostitute himself while she stood right next to him.

"Very well, how does two and a half ounces sound?" Mary said, trying to hide her disappointment as she pulled out a digital scale from under the counter, zeroing it.

"About three grand? Extortionate," Chris replied with a little smile. "But it's a very nice dress."

He got out two pre-weighed bags of dust and another of assorted nuggets which could be split more easily. 

Mary picked up a bag to examine it, using her magical senses as well to examine the metal. She saw something there that she'd only ever heard about, a warm glow and a sense of movement, like the dust in the bag was actually molten. "You've given me the wrong bag. This is dragon-gold, isn't it?"

Lillian inhaled sharply. Susan had been waiting to call out the witch, waiting to see if she was actually honest once she discovered what Chris had to offer. 

"Yes, it is," Susan said matter-of-factly.

"What's that?" Chris asked. 

"He doesn't know?!" Lillian exclaimed. "Jesus Christ!" She narrowed her eyes at the young man. "I'm going to have to watch you closely, dragon."

"I wouldn't have let him give it away," Susan said.

"You could have told me. How much do you have? It should be in the Compound vault." Lillian pushed forward to look into the small case. He must have at least thirty of the little plastic bags, mostly dust and tiny nuggets in the little toiletries bag. She hefted it delicately after extracting it from Chris's hand. "The surprises never stop with you, do they?"

"Can someone please tell me what the fuck dragon-gold is?" Chris asked, getting fed up with people ignoring him.

"It's gold collected from the earth and hoarded by a dragon," Mary explained. "It's magically imbued with the dragon's power and greed. Placed next to other precious metals it slowly makes them grow. That's why in all the legends the dragons are lying on massive piles of treasure. It literally grows around them when they care for it, even more if they take it from the earth themselves." Mary marvelled at the value of the single ounce bag she held in her hand. "Dragon-gold is also used instead of regular gold as part of a spell or potion. It makes the effects far more powerful or long lasting."

"Yeah, so what's the big deal? If it grows then--" Chris clearly still didn't understand.

"Chris." Lillian caught his attention, her expression intense. "It loses its power as soon as the dragon it belonged to dies. People usually drain its power into other gold to increase their holdings or use it up in powerful spells. Ever since dragons started being hunted, before I was even made vampire, it's been very rare. The dragon has to 'lovingly take it from the earth,' with their bare hands, no magic, only a few ever bothered because it's such hard work. Besides, dragons are notoriously miserly. Now that dragons themselves are so rare as well... I doubt there's been dragon-gold on the market for a hundred years."

Chris took a moment to process this information. It seemed he was constantly bombarded with new aspects of his own nature. Sure, he had enjoyed the excitement of searching for hidden treasure in the silts of a cold mountain creek. He'd loved being outdoors and splashing around in the water and sunshine and he did get a comforting feeling from keeping the gold he collected close by. Miserly though? He didn't think he was miserly, and he never could have guessed that he was investing magical value to his small bag of treasure. He turned to Susan with a question in his eyes. 

"Why didn't you tell me, Mom?"

"I didn't want it to ruin what you enjoyed," she said. "You were always so happy going off on your little expeditions, I didn't want that to change. I would have stopped you if you'd tried to exchange it but I didn't want to worry you that people would come hunting for your gold as well as for you."

"So how much is it worth?" he queried, giving his mother's hand a reassuring squeeze.

"I'd be very happy with one tenth of an ounce for the dress," Mary said tentatively.

"You'd be happy with one fiftieth!" spat Lillian, suddenly defensive. "It's practically priceless."

"Sorry, I don't mean to cheat him Lillian," Mary apologized hastily at the vampire's anger. "I don't know what it's worth." 

Chris was startled, it was finally sinking in just how valuable his little hoard was. The problem was, he'd been prepared to part with two and a half ounces. It didn't feel right to give Mary so much less now, after she'd been the one to point out its true worth. His gold didn't feel that special to him, perhaps he'd never really been exposed to anything other than dragon-gold. He made a snap decision when he remembered what Lillian had said. If dragons were so miserly, today he was going to be generous.

"What if I gave you one ounce as thanks for being helpful and honest?"

"It's too much." Mary glanced at Lillian.

"It's my gold, isn't it?" Chris asked.

"Yes but.." Mary started.

"Okay so, please take it, it's yours." Chris closed her hand around the small bag she still clutched. "I hope it serves you well, Mary."

"Th..thank you," she stuttered, putting the bag in a pouch at her neck before bagging up their purchases. 

Annabel was stunned; the gold she'd previously thought must be a small fortune was worth over fifty times its face value, if a value could even be assigned.

Lillian held back a little as the others began to leave.

"I hope you realize how generous that was. That he gave it to you freely makes it even more potent, you know," she hissed. "Thank you for being honest but I can't let you sell that. It would be too obvious where you got it and he's already in enough danger. You'd be putting both him and yourself at risk if you even tell anyone about it. It's worth far more than fifty times its weight to some, there are spells which haven't been wrought for years..."

"I didn't want to sell it," Mary assured. "I just don't know what to do. Maybe I could use it in my ever-clean potion spray but that seems like a waste."

"It would be, clothes don't need to be clean for ten thousand fucking years." Lillian paused to think. "I'll ask Lady Narlakis if she'll pay a renting fee for having it sit in her treasury."

Lillian thought the drow would probably go for it, if she didn't try to snare the rest of Chris's stash as soon as she found out.

"Thank you, Lillian."

Mary breathed a sigh and a shudder as the vampire made herself invisible again before following the dragon. Vampires, always so friendly and charming... until they aren't. She'd been going to call her friends, gloat that the rumours of a dragon were true and that he'd been shopping in her store.

Now she felt the weight of the gold, heavy beyond its true weight with magic. It pulled at her neck but felt warm nestled between her breasts. Realising her friends would know something was up if they ever found out from anyone else, she sent out a message through Maginet, not feeling the sense of giddy excitement she tried to express in the email.

Outside, Lillian called in her latest discovery to Reyla. She had to really.

"What?! Lillian, put him on the phone right now."

Lillian rolled her eyes but handed the phone to the dragon. "She wants to talk to you."

"Hello," Chris greeted her as he put the phone to his ear.

"Chris, is what she just told me true?"

"Well...yeah."

"How did you get it? From trade?"

"No. I read about the gold rushes when I was younger and wanted to see what it would be like. I got lucky that first time and kept going back every few weekends because I enjoyed it."

The drow sounded like she might've been having some serious trouble breathing evenly. She spoke only once she was more calm. "And you are walking out on the street with it? Chris, dear, can I persuade you to secure it somewhere where others will not be tempted?"

"Like where?"

"It should be in a vault, as any gold is nowadays. I have a vault at the Compound that has never been broken into. It will be safe, I would be happy to store it for you."

"No, thanks, Reyla. It's mine, and I think I'd like to keep it nearby."

The next pause was filled with Lillian wondering whether Reyla could hold herself back or if she'd push too hard again. The drow surprised her by conceding. For now.

"Very well, Chris. I look forward to seeing you this afternoon."

They ended up finding Annabel a set of sneakers, some nice flats, and a pair of black heels to go with her dress. Chris also got some shoes to go with his new pants. This time, Susan paid cash.

***

Around mid-afternoon they wound back through the underground passageways to see Reyla. She had them seated in her dark office this time, lounging on low couches near an open fire. Chris thought the fire was a bit over the top, but to each their own. He was, however, impressed by the high shelves of tomes and scrolls. Reyla had clearly amassed an impressive collection of magical knowledge to match her powerful and wise aura. Looking around he realized this was the stuff she wanted people to see; she no doubt had many secrets vaulted away as well.

When Reyla approached them, she first examined Annabel carefully. The drow probed gently so as not to have the feisty little enchantment lash out at her. She'd even shielded herself before launching a gout of flame just past Annabel to the right. It'd bounced right back at the elf with the bright flare of a purple barrier, and she'd caught it quickly.

"Shit," Chris whispered to himself, trying to calm his anxious inner dragon.

Annabel had been even more terrified, then excited as the spell rebounded. The calculating look on the beautiful drow's face told her she was no longer insignificant to these people.

Lady Narlakis, forever dressed in some sort of beautiful gown, didn't dare try any of her more powerful or insidious attacks, intelligently fearing for herself if they also rebounded, or for Annabel's safety if they didn't... and her own yet again as the real dragon would no doubt retaliate. The more she was close to Chris, the more she realized that he was almost her equal. Frightening because she'd worked thousands of years to grow her immense power.

Reyla watched Annabel interact with the little tattoo dragon, seeing how it listened and responded to her, wondering how it had muted Susan that morning. It was indeed a living spell, unheard of in that it was cast on a human. Livings enchantments were rare and unique, it was impossible to say what they could or couldn't do. They were living so they could change and evolve, as could the owner of the enchantment.

"I agree that Annabel is well protected for the moment," Reyla finally said after long moments of contemplation. "She should get some education in the basic exchanges of magic and energy. We will have the tattoo--"

"Bartholomew," Annabel said, and the drow nearly grimaced.

"Yes, we will have 'Bartholomew' registered in your section on Chris's profile."

When conversation returned to Chris's small stockpile of gold, Reyla urged him that if word of it ever got out, it was almost an attractive target as he was.

"And who exactly is going to steal or kidnap in your community, Lady Narlakis?" Chris asked reasonably.

"Well, I admit there are some less...desirable elements living amongst us," Reyla replied. "Beings who still maintain the Secret, but barely live inside the council's other guidelines."

"There are even those who have rejected the council's authority altogether," Susan added. "They live in hiding away from the central hubs of each territory."

The drow arched an eyebrow at the witch but nodded in agreement. "There are only around half a million Beings in the world, so it is easy to lose yourself in the sea of humans, if that's how you wanted to hide. These are the types who steal and kidnap, those who value personal gain above any sense of loyalty or community to Beings as a whole. They live darker lives beneath the face they show the world."

Chris mulled that over. "So...do you know how much my gold is really worth? The witch at the store didn't know."

Reyla sighed again at that unfortunate indiscretion. "I estimate that you could name your own price in any barter. But please, Chris, if you need to purchase something, exchange your gold with me for some other form of currency. It would not do to have dragon-gold on the open market during these tentative times for your species."

They talked amiably about Reyla's territory for a while, the midwestern territory. Fairly different from the human's political borders, the midwest area included the Great Plains and the Rockies, from Canada to Mexico. Despite it being the largest area under one Being's oversight, it had the smallest population of the four territories in the States, but was also the easiest to manage when compared to the complex, central hubs located in many of the largest human cities on the east and west coasts. As with most all territories, Weres and magical humans were the most numerous. It was nature's way of balancing she'd explained, there were far fewer of the older, more individually powerful Beings such as elves and elementals because they reproduced much more slowly even if they did live for thousands of years.

Reyla's territory was especially hassle free, much of the great tracts of land under her control were only frequented by Were packs. They naturally preferred the access to wilderness rather than living in cities and their pack structure made them almost completely self-governed. Reyla generally left them alone if they didn't cause trouble, and that was the way they liked it.

Chris had some questions about dragons but Reyla begged off, asking him to wait until he went to see Lord Guthrie in four days time.

"I have sent a message to my bastard cousin as well," she said with a smile. "He's an Ether mage of somewhat dodgy repute, but I've asked him to come and tutor a 'promising young candidate' in the secrets of the Ether. Once you are settled in, we will discuss your education and employment further. I already have several options in mind that you might enjoy."

When they left, Susan was feeling better about their entire situation in Denver. Reyla seemed to be honestly providing sound, if somewhat self-centered advice to Chris, even putting in the extra effort to examine Annabel and get a tutor in for Chris's Ether magic.

***

Annabel called her parents that evening. Jim and Barbra Sommerset were less than impressed.

"You get your ass back home, now!"

"That's not really possible."

"I'll report a kidnapping, or a missing person."

"Dad, the first thing the police will do is call my cell and I can tell them myself that I'm fine. I'm just moving out a bit early and I'm going to move in with Chris. I'll be back in a few days to collect my stuff."

Her father proceeded to call Chris all sorts of unchristian names. "I want to speak with that boy!"

Annabel could only stifle a laugh as she looked to the couch where Susan was snuggled up next to him while they kissed gently, tongues only just meeting between their partially opened lips. 

"He's indisposed. I love you, gotta go!"

Annabel hung up before joining the two lovebirds on the couch, determined to maintain her fair share of kisses in this relationship.

***

The next few days passed in a blur.

Lillian showed Chris to the security team's workout facility. There were resistance machines designed for Beings so he actually got to give himself a decent workout. Lillian offered to teach him how to fight and they met on the sparing mat.

She'd kicked his inexperienced ass all around the floor. Oslo howled with laughter as she simply threw him over and over again. Once, she'd let him get close to see what he could do. She soon found herself on the floor, arms behind her back with his satisfying weight pinning her. The sensation had almost made her wriggle back into him but she couldn't; it would have been sexual and her blood pact prevented it. For the first time in years, she was a little thankful for its presence.

"You're strong, but you could stand to work on the speed a little," the vampire appraised as she had many a beginner, brushing off her hands as she gained her feet. "Get beyond the grabbing and punching like an amateur and you'll be a force to reckon with."

Now, if he learned to phase, he'd be a terror. She wondered if he'd be a more difficult opponent in his half form, but the dragon remained hidden as it recuperated from its exertion to protect Annabel.

Chris had slipped back into the Ether one night but didn't leave his bed, not wanting to be caught out in unfamiliar, populated territory. When he'd woken up, his dragon was almost back to its annoying, opinionated self. It seemed the dragon could somehow draw energy from the Ether.

Chris delivered coffee to Susan every morning and slept with Annabel every night. Their lovemaking mellowed a bit as they learned to take their time with each other. They would enjoy slowly thrusting together for what seemed like hours before they fucked like frantic bunnies towards the end. He loved that he could get her off a couple times if he was patient and had time to excite her entire body.

Annabel enjoyed how her body was adjusting to him; she was almost constantly ready for him now, a few words or a meaningful look could have her nethers slick and dewy. It was hell on her underwear. He always made her feel so completed, whether he fucked her lazily from behind, watching his penetration distend and drag her labia backwards, gripping tightly to his cock.

Or, if he kissed her neck as his body arched into hers with her legs locked around him, she never failed to find absolute bliss. It often triggered or was followed by a second orgasm as he spilt his magic seed deep in her with forceful, hot, jets. She would lie there for minutes afterwards, enjoying the gooey, tingly, warmth inside her womb as he held her close. 

She didn't realise it bit every time he come inside her, a little more of his magic would soak in, healing any small imperfections both inside and out and priming her with energy. She took on a healthy, beautiful glow as he imbued her, it would be weeks before she noticed. Their inexperience quickly evaporated as they spent their nights learning just how to set each other off. Meanwhile Bartholomew slowly profited from their efforts, growing in minuscule ways each time they expressed their love.

Susan was becoming friskier, too, a little frustrated that she and Chris were stalled at kissing and some rather heavy petting. Though really wanting to go further and cement their new relationship, she didn't push the issue too much, just frigged herself silly in the shower. She was taking a lot of showers recently as her neglected sexuality was rekindled by the dragon's kisses. Annabel was becoming more comfortable with their new relationship, too. She'd discovered that if she ever felt jealous watching them kiss, she could interrupt and demand some for herself. However, turnabout was fair play and Annabel quickly learned that being interrupted wasn't fun. They gradually worked out a system that seemed to work. It mostly involved being patient and generous, but above all else, not hogging the dragon.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
Lillian sometimes found herself frustrated with all the sexy noises and smells around her but Reyla's order not to touch him made it a little easier. She still convinced herself that he was too young and timid for her, that she didn't want him. Besides, his spicy, pheromone-laden scent was becoming more bearable as she learnt to ignore its almost constant presence.

During the days, they explored the magic district together, discussed plans for the future, or their new world in general. Susan even managed to line up a wonderful job opportunity for herself at the apothecary she had previously supplied.

The old wizard who owned the place had known Susan fondly for years. Now that she was back in the magical world for good, he offered her a partnership in his business. She would grow for them full time, helping in the store with brewing when she wasn't busy with the plants. It was always her dream to take her love for magical plants and their concoctions further so she pounced on the opportunity. She'd already given her notice to the university, sighting a family emergency and taking her weeks of accumulated leave, so she was excited to start as soon as Chris's situation settled down.

To start with, she spent a few hours each day in the store, formalizing their agreement and learning the ropes. Rowan, the owner, was an accomplished apothecary and she learned several new tricks in the brief hours they spent together. She was actually a little worried about her plants back at home but called Jethry to make sure he knew how to look after them properly until she could get back. The Werecat was happy to hear things were going well in the 'big city.'

Chris's public Maginet profile went live on the second day, his name, species, class, and territory available to the entire Being world. Annabel had a little section too as his familiar, noting her name, registration date, and that she had an epsilon class protective enchantment. 

"Every profile you see is real," Lillian explained. "The Maginet system is specifically not anonymous like the internet. Profiles are verified by technicians such as Tosh, and are magically resistant to tampering or interception. We don't want ways to trick people or engage in unlawful activities under false names. You might imagine it's vital to the Being contract system."

Chris and Annabel started at tablet, scrolling and navigating through their profile with their fingers.

"Wow," was all Annabel could really say. It seemed just like a regular piece of technology. "So...how does it work?"

The vampire had long accepted being these two kids' personal tome of knowledge. A good thing she liked them. "The entire global system is powered magically, using untraceable energies to communicate between each device. It is silent to humans and their devices." She gestured to the unfinished part of the profile. "You want to include photo images of yourselves?"

Together, Chris and Annabel looked at each other and shook their heads.

"Not now," Chris said.

Within hours Chris had several contract offers and a flood of happy greeting messages.

"Holy shit!" Annabel exclaimed, and Chris's mouth was gaping a little bit. He'd never been popular in high school.

"You forgot to set your profile to state that you're not accepting contracts," Lillian told him with a barely retained chuckle.

At that stage, Annabel kind of took over managing his profile, the Maginet system was apparently foolproof, every message or change carried a magical trace of the individual and each person's devices were unusable by anyone without privileges. Once Annabel had these though, Chris's tablet happily fired up whenever she touched it, he was glad to let her manage it, never a big fan of social media.

She sent out apologies and thanks to the various hopefuls as she gawked at the multi-figure offers for blood, protection, sex, or help creating enchantments. There was even an offer to deflower some old witch's nice as her 21st birthday present.

One evening Chris and Annabel worked up the courage to go to a local establishment known as The Cauldron. They couldn't reveal their true forms but it was a Being club, under the cover of heavy involvement with sci-fi role playing. This way, any humans who showed up weren't freaked out when they overheard a self-professed vampire talking to a witch about blood magic or the like.

It seemed a little weak to Chris, until Lillian spoke up.

"There's also an enchantment that makes humans dismiss anything they hear or see that truly offends their sensibilities. However, given the club's reputation, it attracts a human element who are hard to offend."

"But," he replied, "wont that foster an unhealthy, almost obsessive culture...?"

Lillian just laughed.

The decor was upbeat gothic, still dark, but with colourful depictions of various "mythological" creatures along the walls. Some of the staff appeared to be in "costume" and there was a blue "painted" woman dancing in a cage over by the DJ. By the bar was an all too lifelike stone gargoyle, frozen in a state of arousal as human woman laughed and dared each other to touch the raunchy statue.

The club had a reputation around town as a place to have a wild, uninhibited night where almost anything goes, but somewhere you wouldn't necessarily want to be a regular. 

Lillian had wrangled them up a small booth where they ended up sitting around not knowing what to do with themselves. Chris and Annabel were experiencing the club atmosphere for the first time: dim lighting, an otherworldly light show, loud electronic genre music, few clothes and lots of sweaty bodies.

Lillian shrugged at their timidity. "I have to agree that it didn't have much appeal to me outside of snaring a hapless or... even willing humans for feeding, it's perfect for that."

Tonight the vampire had worn black heels, a pleated red miniskirt, and one of her trademark, clingy turtlenecks; black this time. Chris stole glances at her surreptitiously every now and then, especially her long, toned, absolutely pale legs. They were so beautifully pale he thought he could see small bluish veins lattice up near the hem of her skirt.

He'd never been close to such a beautiful woman who was almost his height, only an inch shorter than his six-foot-three. He had gained two inches to his human form after his transformation; yet another addition to the list of things to get used to. At least he still cleared most doorways, just.

Regardless, Lillian's large body excited him and especially his dragon to no end. It had the promise of being something to fight for and conquer. He knew how it felt up close, too, having been dominated by it that morning at the gym. Deliciously soft yet devastatingly powerful.

Annabel was proving quite the distraction herself. She'd worn her new dress and let her hair fall around her back but held from her face with the ribbon which matched his new shirt. The outfit was indeed slinky and sexy. He'd stuck with his jeans and almost regretted it now. 

Chris thought she looked perfect, her slight nervousness and big, brown eyes again gave an innocent air which delightfully contradicted the seductive dress, the soft curves of her fantastic ass, and the display of so much smooth leg. He'd held her close as they entered the club, protective, feeling on edge with so many people around them.

The club owner, a vampire named Rufus Veldeer, apparently didn't care that they were underage. He delivered some champagne that Lillian ordered personally to the small booth. 

"Lillian, darling, it's so good to see you again. Champagne?" Rufus spoke in dulcet tones.

"Yes, thank you, Rufus. This is my charge, Christopher Baryst, and his familiar, Annabel."

The vampire's face seemed to split into a Cheshire grin as Chris rose to shake his hand.

"It's very nice to meet you, Christopher, and may I just say that you have some very lovely company tonight. Hello, Annabel. You look gorgeous, I wondered if you were his familiar when I first saw you two in the court." 

Annabel blushed and ducked into her seat behind Chris a little 

"Thank you, Rufus, I didn't realize you were at my introduction. You have a very interesting place here. I was sceptical when Lillian described it to me but now that I'm here, it works." 

Rufus laughed heartily. "Yes, yes. It is a little over the top, but I revel in that. As for you though, young dragon, the town has practically been abuzz with talk. Rumours, titterings, lies. I, of course, as a first hand witness, have spread all sorts of fanciful tales about you."

"About me? Why?"

"My boy, we live for centuries and some of us become rather bored," Rufus explained. "A male dragon coming in from the cold is the news of the year, if not the decade."

"Beings are the worst gossipers you're likely to find, Rufus here is notorious," Lillian explained even more succinctly.

"My dear, beautiful vampire, you wound me," Rufus exclaimed with mock hurt. He put an arm around Chris's shoulder almost conspiratorially as he continued. "I apologize for her rudeness, Chris, Annabel. I must warn you, I may be a terrible gossip but Lillian here, despite her loveliness, is a grouch of unprecedented renown. Always ruining my fun."

Lillian simply let out a quiet hiss in his general direction and Annabel couldn't contain a hushed giggle.

"See! She's unstoppable," Rufus continued. "Having you two around will be the best thing that's ever happened to her. Now, speaking of fun, I have an interesting proposal for you, Christopher."

Chris didn't like the sound of that, or the grin on the vampire's face.

"You may be aware that you smell divine, and I'd bet you taste even better. Therefore I propose a potentially very lucrative arrangement. A special drink, the chance to taste a dragon. It would contain a measure of chilled vodka, a half of Sambuca, a half of Grand Marnier, and of course, a few drops of your own delectable blood. I call it the Buffy, for it will surely slay vampires by the dozen!"

Chris didn't know what to make of it, on one hand the idea was hilarious, something he would probably agree to if he was tipsy. Rufus's sales pitch was indeed overly dramatic, but it seemed to suit what he'd seen of him so far. On the other hand he was a little offended he'd once again been propositioned and was concerned what the outcome of offering the drink might be.

"Would you drink it, Lillian?" he asked.

She was somewhat taken aback; the question hadn't struck her in the way he had intended. "Mm," she shrugged, attempting to maintain nonchalant, "I'd probably try it sometime, but I'm not allowed to drink on the job."

Chris's eyes flicked to the glass of bubbly in her hand then looked back at Rufus. "No, thank you, Mr. Veldeer. Perhaps we could do it as a special one night after I'm more settled."

"Of course," Rufus, ever the host, accepted graciously. "I'll leave you to yourselves for now, but please return at anytime. You're always welcome here, Chris, and I'll be honest, you're great for business. Please excuse me."

They'd ended up sipping champagne for a while before Annabel dragged him onto the dance floor. They lasted a few songs, Chris holding her waist or ass with her arms around his neck, writhing their bodies together to whatever spastic beats the DJ wove together. It seemed to be what everyone else was doing.

The crowd of bodies didn't really appeal to them; they were interested in each other so strangers bumping them was just a distraction. By the fourth song, Chris noticed there was a curious young woman dancing behind him. He'd felt her bump him a few times and when he turned, he found her only about an inch from the back of his neck, enjoying his smell.

That was it. They went back to the booth and Annabel sat in his lap as they finished the bottle.

They were about to leave when Amanda, the vampire who'd lost control and attacked Chris on their first day, appeared and asked if she could sit with them for a minute. Chris had somewhat nervously agreed while Lillian never took her eyes off the younger vampire.

"I just wanted a chance to say how sorry I am about what I did to you," Amanda started once she was sitting. "It was unacceptable. I'm young but I've worked hard to control my urges and get a position with Compound security. I can't come out during the day yet, you see, so having a mostly underground job is nice. Look, I'm sorry, I was hungry and you were there smelling so good, it just happened before I could even think to know it was wrong....and thanks for not killing me by the way."

Chris didn't know what to say but forged ahead to accept her apology. "You're Amanda, right?"

She nodded, looking chagrined that she hadn't introduced herself first. Chris didn't seem to notice.

"Well, Amanda, I'm new at this whole thing too so thanks for apologizing and I guess no hard feelings, certainly no harm done. I'm sorry I had that kind of effect on you without any warning."

"Thank you," Amanda said warmly.

She'd resolved to come apologize when she saw them enter the club but over the last few days she'd given up her vampiric schemes to get more of his blood. She didn't have anything to offer in return and he would probably want nothing to do with her.

Besides, it would only lead her further and further down that path. Already from that one taste, she found other blood less satisfying, couldn't get him out of her mind, especially when she slept. It was hard sitting close to him now but she brutally forced her vampire deep down inside herself so she could talk. It meant a lot that he seemed happy to forgive her.

"You haven't...?" Amanda trailed off turning to Lillian.

"Haven't what?" Chris asked curiously.

"No," Lillian said bluntly.

"Don't," Amanda warned.

"Don't what?" Chris asked again.

Amanda sighed. "I'm trying to warn her not to taste your blood, Chris."

"Oh." Chris was confused, Susan had said vampires would want to drink his blood, because it tasted good to them and offered so much sustenance being infused with magic.

"It's too good, Chris, I only tasted a few drops and it's all I can think about," the young vampire confessed. "It's addictive. I can barely stomach human blood anymore."

"I'm sorry," Chris said. "Is there anything I can do?"

"Probably not. Just don't let vampires bite you unless you plan to feed them for the rest of your life."

Amanda got up to leave, feeling better and worse at the same time. She'd been feeling almost depressed ever since she'd had her unsatisfying taste. Walking away was hard but apologizing was good.

"Is she okay?" Annabel asked. She'd remained quiet, just watching the new vampire.

"She will be, I think," Lillian replied. However she was worried. Amanda seemed to have lost some of the sparkle to her eyes, the bounce in her step.

"So the Buffy drink is a bad idea then," Chris stated.

"Very bad," agreed Lillian.

***

Chris's body was pressed back into the leather seat and a few short seconds later the jet was airborne, wheels up. Susan sat next to him and an invisible Lillian was across the aisle. Apart from the bubbly Werecat hostess and the pilot, her familiar, the small jet was empty.

It was wasteful to send a jet for three people but, at the same time, it kind of awesome that he was apparently that important. His thoughts went to Annabel, who was probably back in Laramie by now. He didn't want to leave her behind but it was the perfect opportunity for her to get her affairs in order, placate her parents, and move some stuff down to Denver. Besides, Oslo had agreed to go with her and she had Bartholomew to keep her safe as well.

The flight ended up being smooth, relaxing, and uneventful; the hallmark of an excellent private charter. Once they landed at City Airport, a wizard customs officer boarded the jet and stamped all their passports despite not being able to see Lillian. It was important to conform to human laws and regulations in order to keep their potential footprint as small as possible.

For instance, if they were pulled over by police it was easier to simply have your papers in order rather than to resist or kidnap them until you could get their memories taken, while a nationwide manhunt started for the missing officers. Maintaining the Secret was primarily about blending in unless absolutely necessary; taking memories was no simple business and could leave its own trail of partial images. If done poorly or too long after the event, it could even damage the human.

On the tarmac were three impressive looking black SUVs with serious guards arrayed around. The new arrivals were loaded up rather unceremoniously and the convoy moved off to deliver them to the local Lord.

Chris watched early morning London rolling by with interest through the tinted windows. The skyline was truly impressive, he'd always had dreams of doing a little traveling and now, before he really realised it was happening, he was in another country. He even spotted the face of Big Ben for a few seconds as they drove past Westminster Bridge. It would have been nice to stop and see the sights, Annabel would have loved it, but they had appointments to keep.

Lord Harcot's headquarters was separate from the various territorial hubs, an imposing mansion on what looked to be a contestant for the most affluent street in London. Their convoy rolled into a circular drop off with a large fountain in the middle. It was impressive but the opulence didn't really appeal to Chris. His door was opened by a suited wizard and they were led inside, Lillian and Susan close beside him.

Lord Harcot was shorter than Chris had expected, but had an air or self-assured power that left no doubt he was a Class 1 vampire, well over one thousand years old.

"Ahh. Greetings, Christopher, Lillian," Harcot said, walking over to shake their hands. His accent was thickly British and Chris liked the way words seemed to just roll smoothly off his tongue. "And who is this lovely witch?"

"I'm Susan Baryst, I raised Christopher," Susan responded.

"Indeed. Well, I must congratulate you Susan , you've raised an impressive specimen."

"Thank you," Susan replied.

Harcot looked Chris up and down. "I admit I was a sceptical when the council order crossed my desk. A class 1 male dragon hidden away in plain sight all these years, awakened only a week ago. Yet, here you are in the flesh."

Chris felt a bit uncomfortable under the vampire's assessing eye but resisted the urge to fidget; it seemed like he was always the subject of discussion. He hoped the novelty would wear off quickly.

Harcot turned and smiled at the other vampire in the room. "And Lillian, beautiful as ever I see. I couldn't convince you to kidnap the dragon and come work for me? No?"

"Thank you, no. I'm happy in my current position, Lord Harcot."

"Always so serious dear, Lillian," Harcot smiled. "How about you Christopher?"

"Just Chris is fine," Chris corrected.

"Thank you, Chris, and you may call me Michael. I can't tempt you to relocate to the United Kingdom?" 

"Sorry, I've been propositioned so much in the last week I can barely keep up. Lady Narlakis has been generous, I'll stay with her for the foreseeable future, at least until I get my feet firmly underneath me."

Michael Harcot chuckled, listening to young man, he sounded a little like some of the actors he saw on TV crossed with a cowboy from one of the older westerns "Yes, I imagine you've fielded a few interesting offers. But I see you're a pragmatist, it was worth a try."

The dragon could indeed be a valuable ally; he could feel the magic saturating the air around him. It was always like this with dragons, especially the males. They were like deep springs of overflowing magic, so intimately linked to their aspects that every part of them was imbued and it leaked into their surroundings.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
This one seemed to be particularly potent though, dragons were usually Class 2, especially the young ones. Perhaps it was his unique aspect? Michael could feel his saliva thicken in instinctual anticipation; just the smell of the dragon was a test. He usually didn't feed from men, it was an intimate act after all, but he knew he'd make this exception in the blink of an eye.

"Well," Michael continued, thinking to end the meeting before he became too infatuated. "This is mostly just a formality. I understand you have an appointment in Scotland with Lord Guthrie. I have a car fuelled and waiting for you. I can understand there are always some security concerns around dragons these days, would you like an escort?"

"No, thank you," Lillian said. "I feel anonymity is our best protection at the moment."

"Very well. Then it was a delight to meet you, Christopher, Susan. Lillian, you'll call me if there's anything you need."

Harcot noted that Lillian didn't trust him enough to accept his help. It was probably prudent, he had no doubt she had her job cut out for her trying to protect the dragon. There were plenty who would pay fortunes to have a captive male. It seemed almost foolhardy that she alone had been entrusted the task.

"It was nice to meet you," Chris said with decent American politeness. "If I ever need a change of scenery, I'll remember your offer."

"Delighted." Harcot's smile showed even more of his fangs this time. "Now, you'd better be off, it's at least a seven hour drive to Crieff."

Michael was almost anxious to have them leave now. Once they were out of the room he flashed over to his desk and dialled in a blur.

"Yes," he said down the line. "Get Mary over here. No. Right now!"

He hung up and slumped into his chair a little. His favorite familiar would arrive shortly to assuage his thirst.

***

Sitting in what his body felt should be the driver's seat, Chris was unsettled to begin with. That and they were on the wrong side of the road! However, once he saw how narrow the streets Lillian seemed to glide the late model BMW through with ease were, he was glad he was just along for the ride.

For a while, he stared out the UV shielded window, watching one of the world's great cites flow by. However, after they got onto the highway, he and Susan began reminiscing about car trips they'd taken when he was younger. Soon enough, they broke into their favorite driving game, twenty questions. Lillian even joined in sometimes, usually poaching the answer right out from under Chris's nose with a fiendish giggle. Chris was suitably indignant, but the vampire had such a beautiful smile and seemed to genuinely be having fun; it was too disarming.

The drive so far had been uneventful, but Lillian was alert and anxious. Now they were barely half an hour from their destination, speeding through the deserted Scottish countryside. The car had long ago grown quiet, as the hours passed. Something felt off, like they were being tracked somehow. 

It was overcast, thinking about raining, and they hadn't seen another car since turning onto the single-lane road. Lillian realized her mistake as a blue car came speeding into view behind them over a small rise, she should have stayed on the main roads in the public eye.

"We're about to get hit." She slammed her foot on the gas, making the powerful engine roar and startling Chris from his daydream.

"What?! Are you sure?" Chris exclaimed, turning to see the car gaining quickly. "What do we do?"

"We keep driving."

Lillian tried to remain calm. Looking in the mirror she could see at least three people in the car. She didn't know if she could safely target the car with her telekinetic powers; it was large and had so much momentum.

"There's someone trying to kill the engine!" Susan said from the back, feeling the foreign magic around them. "I'll try to distract him."

She focused her own energy around the car, erecting a weak barrier. This really wasn't her thing and she soon realized she couldn't hold out for long. The wizard she was up against was far more powerful. 

Just then gunfire raked the back windshield, showering glass over Susan as bullets whizzed through the cabin and out through the front. Susan screamed, loosing hold of her concentration and Lillian felt the car gradually start losing power.

"Stay down!" Chris shouted as Susan started to sit up again, scratched from the shower of glass but mostly just shaken.

Flaming adrenaline blasted through his arteries as his dragon roared in absolute rage. He could already feel his wings growing, his scales rapidly snaking down his back and across his chest, his muscles bulging slightly. Looking back he saw a man readying another volley of gunfire from the backseat window.

"Fuck that!" he shouted before his dragon took over, instinct guiding him to rip and tear his enemies.

From the driver's seat, trying to keep the dying car on the road whilst watching their pursuers in the rear view, Lillian heard him shout just before he vanished into thin air.

"Chris, get back here!"

In the Ether, Chris flapped his untried wings with all his strength, jumping up off the floor as he thrust down. His body phased straight through the roof, rising a few meters into the shadowy purple world before he flapped again, gaining more height. He didn't even think about his actions, just let the rage guide him. They were attacking him, putting Susan and Lillian in danger. They would die for it.

As he rose into the Ether, he slowed, the pursuing car was almost underneath him so with an inhuman shriek, he merged back into the Norm; tucking his wings in, he dove straight for its roof, impacting it a crash as it dented and the back windshield shattered in return. 

Glancing at the mirror, Lillian saw the trailing car swerve sharply before regaining control.

"Holy shit," she managed, as she caught glimpses the devastation being unleashed by the vengeful dragon on top of the hapless car.

"Chris? Where's Chris?!" Susan panicked from the back as she noticed her son was missing.

"He's about to kill them."

Lillian tried to drive and watch the action behind as well. There were flashes from inside the car, gunfire through the roof. Susan turned her body, clutching the headrest, to see Chris recoil, a bullet grazing off the tiny scales on his arm and travelling up through his right wing's flight membrane. The purple figure reared back, his furious howl reaching their ears. Suddenly a bright purple orb grew in his hand, spluttering and casting the roadside trees in otherworldly shadow as they sped past. Susan watched in awe as he slammed the blinding purple ball down through the roof, melting a hole.

Chris pushed off the car, once again taking flight to soar a little behind the erratic chase vehicle. His injured wing pained him, the wind stretching the punctured membrane, but he paid it no mind, he was unstoppable. Inside there was a brief panic as the orb hovered for a second, pulsing ominously. The mage managed to erect a barrier before the blast hit, shredding the three other occupants with magical shrapnel. Without a living driver, the car quickly left the road, plowing through the low vegetation until it impacted a larger tree with a satisfying crunch, followed by the ticking of cooling metal.

"Stop! Stop! Go back," Susan urged, seeing the brilliant flash of purple light, shards of purple exploding outwards, splintering into the air and vanishing as the car swerved off the road.

Lillian, in complete control of the car again quickly slowed, skidding onto the slick verge as she made herself invisible and leapt from the car into the light rain, sprinting back up the road. Susan brushed glass off herself quickly and ran after her, desperate to make sure Chris was okay. 

Lillian arrived to see the dragon ripping the passenger door off, yanking a barely conscious mage out as he tore through the seatbelt. His shield hadn't saved him entirely; having been disintegrated in the blast, he'd felt the full impact of the crash.

"Who sent you!" the dragon yelled, barely an inch away from the man he held so easily by the neck.

The man mumbled something unintelligible before trying again. It almost sounded like he said "no choice."

"What was that?!" the dragon bellowed, loosening his hold.

"I said fuck yourself," the mage gurgled.

Before he knew he'd done it, the man's neck broke with a sickening crack. He let the body fall, slumping limply into mud by the wrecked car.

Lillian's invisible face broke into a wry smile, it seemed the dragon had plenty of backbone when he needed it.

Susan panted as she arrived, watching the body fall and Chris take a startled step back, realising what he'd just done.

Lillian rushed forward to examine the car and its dead occupants as Chris took in his surroundings. The inside was a mess, blood mist still thick in the air where the shrapnel had hit the three men's bodies. She sniffed, smelling the mage and a Werewolf, but surprisingly two humans as well.

Ignoring the blood - she didn't want to drink from these degenerates anyway - she rummaged their ripped corpses, pulling out IDs. Checking for familiar tattoos on the humans, she found none. She even stripped one naked, slicing through his clothes with her extended black claws, but found nothing other than an armed forces tattoo at his shoulder.

Something was wrong. They had government ID booklets, as well as military issue pistols, not to mention the sub machinegun lying spent in the back. These men weren't registered familiars; they were humans, government humans. So what the Hell were they doing attacking a dragon with a mage and a werewolf driver? Was someone using unregistered familiars inside the government as their own personal army?

She quickly got out her phone and started videoing everything: the car, the men, the ID's, the weapons, reciting her observations as she went. She even went over to video Chris, taking in his bruised bullet graze and wing puncture. His blood was hard to resist out in the open but the light rain helped and she was focused on her job. Besides, they needed to get out of here fast.

"Are you ok?" Susan asked tentatively, reaching out but afraid to actually touch her son. If she was honest, after witnessing what he was capable of, she was terrified.

He turned and saw how worried she was, shivering there in her t-shirt as a light drizzle fell.

"I'm fine, Mom." Chris assured her, collecting her in his arms he held her close as Lillian wrapped up her examination.

Susan, still shivering, clung to his warmth as her adrenaline high died, leaving her feeling weak and tired and a little sick. He extended his wings again, wincing a little as the bullet hole was stretched. But then he wrapped them down and around, making a little shield for her. The droplets of water pattered against it lightly.

"Who were they?" Chris asked.

Lillian spoke as she worked to get various close ups of the men's marred faces. "These humans may be unregistered familiars, but are definitely government security. MI6 or whatever backroom agency they come up with every other month. The Werewolf I have no idea, and we'll never get anything out of the mage now."

"Sorry," Chris said gravely. "Perhaps I shouldn't have killed him. I didn't mean to really."

"No, we don't have time to drag him along. The humans are the important part anyway, I can't think of any reason they would be here. It's really illegal to have unregistered familiars and these guys were obviously aware of us."

Lillian rolled one of them over onto his back to video him. Half of his face was missing, shaved clean off by several shards of Ether. "You certainly did a number on them."

Even Lillian was astounded at the gruesome destruction in front of her. The car hadn't fared any better than the men, peppered with jagged tears and holes, metal hadn't been a barrier to the purple shards.

"I kind of went nuts, huh? Fuck, I don't even understand half of the shit I did."

Chris was worried that he seemed to have a complete lack of empathy towards the men. He'd just killed four people and at the moment it seemed to matter less than the fact that Susan was cold and shivering. Perhaps he was a sociopath, or maybe he was just in shock.

"You did well, Chris." Lillian stopped to reassure him. "You defended yourself and us, possibly even saved our lives."

"I killed four men, Lillian." Chris's voice raised more than he intended. "And I'm finding it hard to care. That's not normal!"

"Why should you care?" Lillian snapped back, frustrated with the dragon's instincts constantly at odds with the kid's perception of his world. "We don't have time for a little meltdown. This is the ugly side of our world, the kill or be killed side. You can come to terms with that when we aren't still in danger out in the open!"

The expression on his face made her regret the harsh outburst. It really was a pity he couldn't remain as he'd started: normal and nice and innocent.

She softened her voice, but maintained her point firmly. "You were attacked. It's their fault they underestimated you, not yours. Would it make you feel better if they'd succeeded? If Susan or I was killed?"

"No," he mumbled.

"That's what I thought. Now, get your mother back in the car, we need to go."

Lillian was almost done, just doing a final check to make sure there was no obvious evidence of magic on the bodies. 

Chris steered Susan back down the road, holding her close with his uninjured left arm. Thankfully no other cars passed by, or they would have seen a large, purple dragon-man tenderly guiding an attractive woman into the back of a shot-up car. He laid himself on the back seat, hopefully out of sight, and had Susan lie on top of him, safe from the broken glass underneath him before shutting the door. It was cramped and awkward for his large body but they didn't have far to go. 

"Don't you ever do that again," Susan said from her perch on his chest, looking down into his reptilian eyes and thumping him weakly with her fist. Her clothes were wet and cold but his body was warm against hers and he held her tightly despite her scolding. "You had no idea who was in that car or what they were capable of. Lillian's here for a reason, that's her job."

"They were about to shoot at us again Mom, I couldn't risk that." Chris ran his hands up and down her back soothingly. "I'll always defend us, it's my nature to protect."

"That's stupid," Susan sniffed. "You could have died!"

"Shhhh, we're fine," he consoled, leaning up to kiss her lightly. She eventually calmed, snuggling into his cream coloured neck as she shook quietly, outraged at the world for being so violent.

Lillian was soon back in the car and they sped off. To anyone who looked twice, the bullet-ridden car had no occupants whatsoever. She dialled as she drove, only waiting a few seconds before the drow answered her emergency number.

"We've been attacked on our way to the dragons," Lillian began without preamble. "A wizard and a werewolf as well as what I'm assuming were two unregistered familiars."

"You, neutralized them?" Reyla said calmly, although her heart raced slightly. She assumed correctly that she wouldn't be receiving the phone call if the situation wasn't resolved.

"He did," Lillian looked back towards the dragon, comforting his mother in the back seat. "It was all over in just a few seconds."

"How?"

"The dragon surfaced and he phased and flew onto the car chasing us, then let off some sort of explosion inside it. It was magnificent."

Reyla mulled this information over for a few seconds. So he was an instinctual fighter, she'd suspected as much. Again, she considered her luck to have him land so fortuitously in her lap.

"If you're in the clear for now, try to make it to the dragons. They'll provide safe haven overnight but I want you back here tomorrow. Try to be unpredictable in your movements. Unregistered familiars, the Synod is going to have a field day. This stinks of bounty hunters, I never should have let him leave my territory."

"Okay, I'll send you the evidence I collected soon. Get someone to start looking into the humans."

"Keep him safe, Lillian." Reyla's voice had a sharp edge that even managed to be transmit across thousands of miles.

Lillian hung up, knowing nothing more needed to be said for the moment. She would protect the dragon, with her life if necessary, she didn't need to be told that.

She began uploading the video and photos to Reyla, her inhuman speed and dexterity came in handy now as she multitasked, speeding down the wet, narrow roads.

Lord Harcot seemed genuinely surprised by the attack when she called him. Lillian was inclined to think he wasn't behind it however, you could never quite tell over the phone. Harcot would arrange for a cleanup, it would be hours until the crew arrived so they would have to work to mislead whatever investigation the human authorities started. She kept the evidence she'd collected to herself, their IDs, a small sample of each of their blood, the memory of their scent, and the video recording. She would get to the bottom of this herself if needs be. 

Examining the scene in her mind again, it was impossible to place the two humans. There was absolutely no way they could be there. They must have known the Secret, yet they weren't familiars, not registered at least. It didn't make sense, the play was especially foul. The vampire also realized she might have been in trouble if the dragon hadn't stepped in. The mage was quite powerful, had been carrying vials of death's bane potion, and the Werewolf had a wooden stake strapped to his thigh. They'd been prepared to fight a vampire. In combination with automatic gunfire from the humans, it would have been an interesting fight.

Speaking of fights, there was no doubt in her mind now that the dragon could. Perhaps he lacked a little finesse but he certainly made up for it with style and brute force, not to mention that fucking Ether grenade he'd set off. She'd never heard of anything like that before.

They drove as fast as safely possible. It was more important now to distance themselves and reach the safety of Lord Guthrie's property than to not be noticed. Susan was very cold in the back as freezing air streamed through the broken windows. Chris tried to keep her warm, holding her between the back of the seat and his body but she shivered miserably in her damp clothes.

Soon enough they pulled up to the wrought iron gates and Lillian got out to use the intercom. 

"Lord Guthrie, this is Lillian Kozlov, we've been attacked on our way here. Please let us in immediately." She looked around nervously but didn't have to wait long for a reply.

"Good heavens! Of course," the gates clicked and began rolling open. "Drive all the way to the end of the road, you'll be safe here."

Another five minute drive through low woodland had them outside a large, surprisingly modern house. A middle aged man and woman came rushing out, and another woman waited by the door. Extracting himself from the car, Chris sensed the two dragons for what they were: kin. The female took her mate's hand and beckoned Chris forward reassuringly. Standing up to his full height, he strode forward with Susan still under his arm as the light rain continued.

Their meeting was somewhat tense, the young dragon and the older couple examining each other for a few moments. Lord Guthrie could tell the youngling was on edge. From the state of the car and the healing bullet hole in his wing, their attack had been quite traumatic. His half-form was magnificent, however; the epitome of a dragon male and his coloring was indeed that of the Ether.

"Hello, Christopher, I'm John Guthrie." He spoke with a thick Scottish brogue and carried himself as a Lord might, even as he had to tilt his chin up to meet Chris's eyes. He was short, wiry, and tough looking but his peppered brown hair gave him an air of sophisticated middle-age even though Chris knew he was ancient. His blue gaze felt piercing and yet somehow calming, it felt like he was meeting long lost family.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"This is my mate, Elizabeth."

"It's nice to finally meet you Christopher," Elizabeth added. "I've been excited all week."

The female was beautiful, blond and full-bodied, her clean scent tantalizing him. Her accent wasn't the same as John's, rather a more mingled combination of several European regions with French slightly dominating.

Chris felt his dragon sizing up the smaller male. There was an urge to bluster and fight but there was also a sense of deep respect for his age and knowledge. The mated pair shared a look, a feel of being completely in tune with each other.

"Hello," Chris said a little lamely. "It's nice to meet some other dragons. Um... could we please go inside, my mother is very cold."

"Yes, yes, of course. I'm sorry. " Elizabeth turned and called to the woman by the door. "Catherine, get some blankets, please."

"Thank you. I'm Susan," she introduced herself, teeth chattering. "The vampire with the bags is Lillian, Chris's bodyguard."

"Welcome," Lord Guthrie said warmly. "Rest easy now, you're safe here."

The Guthrie's house was warm; they were guided into a living area and with a modern fireplace. The floors were a light colored hardwood with rugs strategically placed under the couches and furniture. Dim natural light flooded through skylights and the numerous long windows against the two exterior walls, which appeared to be plaster over stonework. The light, open-modern theme seemed out of place to Chris; he would have expected dragons to live in an underground lair.

Their hosts guided them to couches near the fireplace, and Susan decided to stand in front of it rather than sit. Chris, clothes slightly tattered around his half form with his wings poking out through the back of his shirt, slumped into the offered couch, resting his head in his hands, his elbows on his knees. His body was still calming down after the attack, leaving him a slightly drained and tired, a little like Susan. 

John and Elizabeth watched the young dragon with interest as they questioned Lillian about the attack. The invisible vampire explained how they had been shot at while their car's engine lost power until Chris phased onto the back of the car and destroyed it.

"May I see the video, Lillian?" John asked, and by the way he approached her, the request was more a formality. Chris tensed at his tone and John noticed, perhaps smelling something in the air he turned to reassure the boy. "I am a member of the Synod, Christopher, and a fellow dragon. It is an obligation to get to the bottom of this, as well as a personal concern." 

Lillian relinquished her phone, showing him the video and John was impressed with her assessment. The two humans were the key to finding out what was going on. "I promise you my backing if you need it, Lillian, and I will start my own investigation forthwith. We can't have unregistered humans attempting kidnapping. It's a huge breach of the Secret."

"Thank you, Lord Guthrie," Lillian realised how helpful Synod backing might be. "Unfortunately, after the attack, both Lady Narlakis and I think it's important to return to Denver as soon as possible. We'll be leaving tomorrow morning, perhaps we can return when things settle down a bit. Or you could visit Chris if your business takes you to the States."

Catherine, a Being Chris couldn't place, came back with some thick wool blankets for Susan who stripped unceremoniously down to her underwear and wrapped up tight.

For a moment she had considered if it was appropriate but decided she didn't care; she shuffled over to the couch and snuggled up next to Chris. He made her feel good, comforted her, which was exactly what she needed right now. He wrapped an arm around her and as she warmed, she began to doze off, attempting a few times to keep up with the conversation but finding it futile. The vibrations of his deep voice sent her right to sleep.

"Your mother must have been quite terrified," Elizabeth commented. "It's good you comfort her like that."

"Yes." John agreed. "Witches and wizards may have quite admirable control over magic, but they do lack the constitution of the more physical races."

As if knowing she was the subject, Susan wriggled closer to him in her sleep, burying her face under his arm and attempting to put a leg on top of his. Chris looked around the room nervously, the act was a little too intimate for the company.

"You don't need to feel awkward, Christopher," Elizabeth added with a cheeky smile. "Your relationship with her has changed. We understand."

"You know? How?"

"The way she smells of you and the way she went straight to you," Elizabeth explained soothingly. "There's no shame in that, it's natural."

"Yes, indeed," John reminisced. "A young dragon like you needs a good brood. I remember before Elizabeth and I settled down I had six beautiful women. Loved them all dearly, too."

"It just seems wrong," Chris almost muttered. "I've been raised as a human my entire life except some memories I can barely recall of my mother and father." 

"Yes, but that's why you're here," said the older dragon. "I'm very sorry about David and Marie. I begged your father to go through official channels to get justice for your mother's death, but he asked me what kind of man would sit by as his mate's murderer walked free. He was grief-stricken, I can understand that."

Chris was saddened to hear of his parent's deaths but perhaps, in the future, Lord Guthrie could help him get to know them a little better than what he remembered in his young, foggy memories.

Lord Guthrie continued. "We'd thought you were dead all these years too. Now we want to help you. We had planned for you to be here at least a week, to teach you about dragons, about yourself. We have this evening at least."

"Even a little now would be great," Chris sighed. "These things keep happening to me that I have little control over or seem so foreign. It's like my dragon is a separate entity inside my mind with his own ideas and thoughts."

"Yes, that's an unfortunate effect of being awakened suddenly," Elizabeth said, tucking a lock of blond hair behind her ear. "It usually it happens over several years in our children when they're about six or seven. The two minds have time to blend and become seamless. It will take a while for you." She shook her head, looking concerned. "You poor boy. You must have gone through so much this last week." 

"You'll need to get used to the effects of our physical changes, too," John said. "You're stronger, faster, much more durable, and you'll heal faster than you're used to. Not to mention your senses are well above human level."

"Yeah, I've figured all that out. The pheromones were a bit of a shock, though." Chris chuckled.

"I imagine so." Elizabeth returned a smile. "Yours are particularly pleasant, Chris, very spicy and masculine."

"...Thanks?" Chris looked nervously towards John as his wife pecked his ear and whispered something even he couldn't hear before she got up and approached him. John winked at him, making Chris even more nervous, as Elizabeth ended up kneeling on the couch at his side not occupied by Susan, her knees touching him.

"Relax, it's okay, Chris." Elizabeth soothed. "I'm just getting to know you a little better. I think you'd be perfect for a frustrated young woman I know, maybe even her mother, too."

"Wh...Who's that?" Chris stuttered.

He was entranced as he experienced his first physical contact with his own species. She leaned in to sniff delicately at his neck. He automatically cocked his head to allow her better access, and she gently kissed his creamy throat. 

"Females have our own pheromones, too, you know. They indicate we're receptive. Would you like to smell them?" Elizabeth cooed.

She could easily get a little caught up in her examination. She was trying to gauge his strength, his vitality, his temperament from the way he smelled and tasted. She wasn't disappointed. Slowly, she released her pheromones as she kissed up his neck, determined to also have his lips.

Chris leaned back and let it happen, she felt great kissing up his throat, soft and yet confident in her actions. He brought a hand up to stroke her side through her blouse, just below her full breast. He smelled her simple, clean scent become warmer, earthy, heavier. Instantly his dragon knew what it meant and purred happily, the female wanted to mate with them.

Then he realized he was actually purring somehow, a low kind of growl coming from his chest. It stopped as soon as he thought about it.

"That's the smell of a ready female. Remember it when you meet others. It's an invitation, but it might be the only warning you get."

Elizabeth took his face in her hands to look deeply in his eyes. She enjoyed his gentle touching for a few moments but noticed he seemed concerned, confused, maybe.

"Your colouring is very attractive and you're strong but also gentle. Yes, I think you'll be perfect."

"What's your colouring?" Chris murmured, captivated by her green eyes. "And what am I perfect for?"

"I'm a blue, a water dragon. John's a brown, earth. I go nearby to Loch Turret to recharge, John melted a hole deep into the earth for himself to be close to his aspect. You're an anomaly though, unique, and we don't actually know what to do with you other than let nature run its course. Hmm... does your dragon take you to the Ether?"

"Yes, I go there when I sleep sometimes." Chris sighed, the earlier mention of John had him look briefly towards the other male, who was watching intently but seemed perfectly confident that his wife was teasing another male. Elizabeth brought his attention back by brushing his cheek.

"Why won't you tell me who you meant?" he asked.

"Because I haven't finished yet."

Elizabeth leaned down to place her full lips softly on top of his. She moved them experimentally for a few seconds before he responded naturally. Soon their tongues met tentatively, just a flick between their lips but their mouths opened to accept each other and they slid together slowly. They each savored the essence of the other; to him she was wisdom and beauty, tasting slightly sweet and pure like a spring; to her, he was youthful, exotic power, unsure of himself but capable of so much. He tasted spicy and also slightly smoky. She could tell he would make an excellent mate if she wasn't already spoken for. 

Breaking the kiss somewhat hesitantly Elizabeth was almost certain now. "You'll make the perfect mate for Clair Godran."

"Who's she? " Chris asked, catching his breath slightly after their long, drugging kiss.

"She's the next youngest after you, a female red. She's met all six of the other males but doesn't want them. I'm sure she'll like you though, you're strong enough to handle her temperament but you'll be tender. She needs that, too, because she's inexperienced."

"You're setting me up? Don't I get any say?" 

"What's there to say?" Elizabeth asked, patting his chest. "She's beautiful and fiery, a challenge for you. She's given up hope of having a mate in her lifetime, which is such a sad fate for one so young. She and her mother can teach you about being a dragon."

Chris didn't know what to say as Elizabeth extracted herself from him.

"Thank you Chris, that was lovely."

Blinking, the younger male looked at the senior, wondering why he had remained silent during all that. 

"Don't worry, Christopher," John started as his wife came to sit by him again and took his hand, smelling of another male. "We don't force matings but Elizabeth usually has a good sense of these things. It's important we find you mates as soon as possible. You're the seventh male dragon we know of. There are twenty-two females but less of them are breeding. Conception is so hard for us."

"Why's that?"

"We're at the top of the food chain, Chris, and almost immortal so the balance of nature insures we bear few children. There have always been more female dragons, too, some artefact of our reptilian essence and our polygamy. The problem is, it sometimes takes decades or centuries for females to become pregnant, even with regular coupling and itch injection."

"Itch injection?" Chris queried.

The older male looked bemused. "Itch is what we call the male's second venom. All dragons have a deadly poison we can inject through our fangs but males also have itch. It induces fertility, engorging the female's womb with magic for our seed to take hold. It... ahem... also makes them more tractable and insures they stay around long enough to become pregnant. It's somewhat addictive." 

"You mean it turns me into your mewling, little sex doll, husband?" Elizabeth tittered teasingly.

"Well, if that's how you want to word it." John blushed at her intensity, then returned the playful, almost randy look, as if he was accepting a challenge. "It also makes sure only one male can impregnate the female while they're working at it."

Elizabeth puffed up a little. "Yes, I'd word it like that, you snarly, old brute. It makes me so hot and needy. I love it!"

John actually growled in response, despite trying to act the polite Lord of the Manor. It looked like they might attack each other and rip their clothes off for a second.

"Wait, uh," Chris almost was almost desperate to interrupt what felt like foreplay between the two. "How addictive is the itch? Is it permanent?"

Elizabeth turned to Chris and shook her head, her face still a little flushed. "It's not permanent. If I were to be separated from John and far away from him for a month or so, then the itch would wear off and I would in theory be receptive to another male." She looked at her mate with a very warm smile. "I do not see that happening, however."

The young dragon pondered that over as the older dragons cooled off. He needed more answers however, and cleared his throat to continue.

"My dragon told me some of that stuff when my girlfriend asked if we needed to use protection. He seemed to think that as long as I don't bite her, she'll never get pregnant by me."

"Yes, male dragons can't impregnate females unless they bite them with itch a couple times first," Elizabeth laughed, seeming especially giddy with the topic. "Doesn't stop them trying though."

"I took my girlfriend as my familiar, ended up casting a living spell on her actually... don't ask me how. Can we even have children at all? What will they be?" asked Chris.

"A living spell?" John queried, distracted from his actual questions. "I remember the shockwave the other day but none of the reports mentioned it was a living spell. This is very interesting, Chris, could you tell me about it?"

Chris tucked aside his questions about children for the moment, explaining what happened and how Bartholomew appeared to be there to protect Annabel but also gave her some magical influence on her surroundings.

Lord Guthrie grunted in thought, nodding to himself for a few moments. "This is very impressive, I can feel that you've got a lot of raw power but livings spells are rare. And to cast one without even trying to? You have potential to achieve greatness among us."

"I don't want greatness, why does everyone seem to think that?" Chris muttered.

"Well, you're a Class One Being and a dragon. Greatness is expected."

The young dragon frowned in though before reminding him. "What about children with Annabel?"

"Hm? Oh, yes, you do need to know what you're doing, don't you." He chuckled and nodded. "You can indeed have children with your human familiar. All beings except vampires and other undead can bear children. Sorry, dear." John looked apologetically at Lillian.

"Pffft, no apology needed." Lillian brushed it off with apparent honesty. "The idea didn't appeal to me much when I was human. Now it's an impossibility."

"Indeed. Anyway, if two different species mate - a male dragon and a lycan female, for example - the children will be either one or the other. Werewolf pups or dragon whelps. Our world doesn't work in hybrids and half-breeds. What determines which species the children will be is again up to nature's balance and therefore, in this situation, Werewolves would almost always be born. The pups would no doubt be healthy and powerful from such a strong father but they would be completely wolf. Their offspring, too."

"So Annabel and I can have children but they'll be human, not dragon?" Chris clarified.

"Exactly," Elizabeth chimed in. "They would probably make competent wizards or witches but the chances of a dragon child would be astronomical."

"Okay, but why would they be magical humans? Shouldn't they be normal humans?" He was a little confused with the somewhat illogical Being breeding system.

"Dragons overflow with magic, direct conduits for their aspects," the female dragon picked up where her mate left off. "Your children with a human would receive some magic and be able to control it, making them a witch or wizard. This is the same reason we're endangered, other Beings want to use this magic themselves. It's why you're the best a woman can expect to ever have outside of another species' mating bond, it's why your vampire friend can barely stop herself from sinking her fangs into your neck."

Elizabeth didn't stop as Chris's head snapped to look at Lillian. "Indeed, successfully impregnating a female dragon is all about building up enough magic inside her to overcome the barriers nature has in place to limit such individually powerful Beings breeding rampantly. Now that we're so few, it will be our downfall." 

"Lillian?" Chris asked, reminded of how difficult it must be for her, especially with his dry blood around his healing wounds.

"I'm fine, Chris," She said firmly, maintaining her professionalism in the wake of Elizabeth outing her like that.

They talked a while more as the afternoon light faded into evening. Chris had a bit more explained to him about dragon aspects and how every so often, dragons should go back to their element, recharging their magical potential. John said that because the Ether usually drained Beings who entered, being recharged by it would make him unique among Ether users.

He also encouraged Chris to pursue his education in both Ether and traditional magic. It was often difficult for dragons to master specific incantations or spells like humans easily could. They were more instinctual, relying on their aspects. However, if he could also perform magic outside of his aspect it would greatly increase his versatility and surprise any enemies who prepared specifically to fight an Ether user.

When Chris asked about his true dragon form, Elizabeth explained how it was a process of asking the dragon forward, ceding more control to that part of himself. 

"However, I discourage you from trying it too soon," she said. "It would be best if you became more comfortable with your dragon first."

When a slight lull occurred in the conversation, Elizabeth looked at the clock, making a quick calculation before pulling out her Maginet phone and dialling. Chris watched with interest, thinking he should call Annabel also, but deciding to wait until bedtime. John and Lillian seemed to be discussing some Synod politics about "turning" restrictions when someone answered Elizabeth's call. Chris listened intently to one side of the conversation.

"Hello, Petra. Yes. Yes, it has been too long. I know. Look I doubt it's common knowledge yet but we've discovered a new male. Yes, he's listening to me right now." Elizabeth smiled over at Chris. "No, he's young. He's unique, Petra, his aspect's the Ether. He's delightful, a bit young but huge potential. He's gentle, too.

Chris squirmed under the older dragon's praise, feeling a growing sense of pride. He tried distracting himself by repositioning some of Susan's lovely dark hair while she slept, but made sure to keep his ears trained on the conversation.

--------------------------------------------
"Yes, that's why I'm calling. I'm almost certain he's perfect for Claire and he could use both of you to help him come to terms with being a dragon. He only awakened a week ago. Yes, he's very good looking, smelling, too, if you must know. He's a big cutie." Elizabeth grinned at Chris again as he blushed even harder. "No, I think it's best if they meet face-to-face. Yes, Denver, you won't even have to move continent. Great! I'll send you his profile, you should call him in a few days once he gets back. Yes. Bye-bye, dear, and good luck."

She hung up and came to sit by him again, stroking the back of his folded wing and sending shivers over him. "That was Claire's mother."

"Oh?" Chris managed; he didn't know if her being this intimate with him was pleasant or awkward.

"They'll call in a few days to arrange a meeting. I'm sure you'll make them very happy," she whispered close to his ear.

"Them? Both of them?" Chris was worried; he already had too many women to deal with.

"Well, of course. If they like you, and they will. You're one of the biggest, most attractive males I've seen in generations and you have a species to save." As she spoke Elizabeth began teasing his wing more forcefully, making it twitch. She also leaned in again to sniff him, pressing her lips against his shoulder and her soft breasts against his arm. "I'm sure you're <I>up </I>to it."

Chris followed her eyes down to his jeans where the telltale sign of his erection was bulging a little painfully down his leg. He noticed her scent in the air again and it only made his hard on twitch even more. 

"Stop," Chris pleaded. "Your husband's sitting right there."

"Give the poor boy a break, Beth." John chuckled, knowing just how much his mate loved to play.

Elizabeth stopped her teasing, holding her hands still but mashing her breasts in a little closer. Chris was actually showing surprising restraint; she'd half expected her smell to have him pawing at her.

"Little hatchling," She cooed with her breath in his ear. "I have chosen John, but if I were young and unmated, I'd have raped you by now." 

"Fuck," Chris murmured, as she strutted back over to sit by her husband, sharing a brief kiss with her mate.

That was when it really hit him, she wasn't just a woman. She was a dragon just like him. She had the same wild beast inside her, the same instincts, to fly, to hunt, to mate. The magnificent female had just been playing with him, and he was far out of his depth.

He got a sudden urge to challenge the older male for her but his dragon's twisted reason prevailed; it wouldn't be respectful to his elders nor logical to the survival of his species.

***

Susan woke up not long after and they ate a hearty roast meal prepared by Catherine, who turned out to be a wood sprite from the nearby forest, and John's lover. Chris wondered how they made that dynamic work.

"So it's true for all dragons?" he asked, glancing at Susan and remembering what she'd told him about the other women who had lived with his father when the was young. "How do you make something like that work?"

Elizabeth looked to be somewhat glowing as she straightened her back to answer. "John is the one I chose, and he keeps me happy and satisfied. As long as that remains, I don't care who else he does." She winked over at Catherine before continuing. "Besides, I love her, too."

Lord Guthrie chuckled and finished chewing a large bite of meat before speaking to Chris, gesticulating with his knife while his fork was already on the way to skewer a succulent potato. "We have a theory on this. It seems that something about dragon males makes their women content to share, though no one seems to be sure if it's just the scent or something about the sex." He shrugged. "I personally support the theory. When I was young-"

"Twelve hundred years ago," Elizabeth teased her mate, and Chris's eyes bulged a little at hearing that.

"Ahem. Yes. Anyway, when I was young, I saw two elf sisters who detested each other both fall in love with the same dragon, and they lived under his roof, more or less happily, for centuries!"

This confirmed Lillian's own suspicions from the last few days; there was something about the way Annabel and Susan quickly fell into sharing the dragon that seemed far too easy. Sure, they might have known each other for years but she'd suspected some sort of influence or magic. But if Chris had no control over it, he could hardly be blamed for doing anything seedy or forbidden, like mind-control. Perhaps it was all part of being dragon-struck, like Annabel and Susan clearly were.

She mused over this for a while before examining their attack for the umpteenth time. They should be in the clear, but the humans were still bothering her, annoyingly so. She had to do something about it. She'd have to have a friend look them up when she got back to Denver.

Lillian was feeling hungry as well, especially watching the others eat. The dragons didn't have any blood on hand and she'd wished Elizabeth hadn't told Chris how hard it was for her to resist his blood. He'd given her such a sorrowful look, like he actually cared she was suffering. Now she was surrounded by three delicious smelling dragons, yet strangely Chris still stood out as her preferred choice. Perhaps his scent had become engrained in her mind; he was certainly young and fresh, just the way she liked it.

When dinner was over they talked for a few more minutes before starting for bed, keen to have an early night after their travel and traumatic day. They would be back on the road by midmorning, their expected time here cut short by the unknown threat that had tracked them on the road.

Catherine showed Chris to his room, a simple guest bedroom with a nice, long, double bed. He was still in his dragon form and didn't much feel like changing back, so the size suited him. Catherine carried on down the hall to show Susan her room, but Chris turned to find his mother hovering nervously by his door.

"Can I stay with you tonight? I'll sleep on the flo.." Susan started.

"Sure," He said. "Bring your stuff in and shut the door."

Instead she just rushed into his arms, squeezing his hard body tight. "Thank you, Chris. Thank you for everything, especially this afternoon. I love you."

"I love you too, Mom."

He hugged back. She seemed to be the only one deeply affected by the afternoon's events. The only normal one.

Susan then collected her small suitcase and shut the door as he'd suggested. He was rummaging around in his own case as she went to the bathroom, brushing her teeth and changing into an old t-shirt and a new pair of silky, breathable panties for bed. When she came out, he was just in a pair of sweatpants, his broad, creamy chest and strong purple arms displayed to her. She started making a nest of blankets on the floor to sleep in but he interrupted her.

"Jump in bed, you don't have to sleep on the floor." 

Susan's blood thumped in her ears as she pulled back the sheet and slid into the bed.

<I>Will he let me sleep with him? </I>she wondered as he went to the bathroom. <I>Maybe not... he's probably just being a gentleman as usual, sleeping on the floor so I can have the bed. </I>

When he emerged he went over to his side and slid in, too, her heart raced. Was this really going to happen?

They lay there on their sides watching each other for a few moments, his wings resting behind him. Susan didn't dare move, caught in his intense gaze, scared that any movement on her part would scare the mystical creature away from her.

Chris felt an overwhelming urge to hold her close, reassure himself she was okay. He acted on that protective, primal feeling, his arm snaking under the covers with inhuman quickness around her waist, making her gasp. He dragged her unceremoniously across the bed to him, the friction of the sheets hot against her skin.

Before she knew it, he was nuzzling her hair, stroking down her exposed side dangerously close to her breasts and bare ass as he fitted her against his body. Susan sighed, relaxing herself completely, letting everything fall away except his comforting, arousing touches. She tilted her head up and found his lips already descending on hers; they kissed passionately but slowly for what seemed like hours.

It was her first time being physical with him in this form. She couldn't deny that it somehow had added appeal. Maybe she was just a sucker for his more defined muscles, which she proceeded to explore with her hands. Maybe it was the danger of his teeth and claws, or the softness of his tiny scales. His essence certainly smelled and tasted stronger like this.

Chris loved kissing Susan, he always did. She made such appreciative little noises and he adored her cute, slightly larger upper lip, teased it mercilessly until it was even more swollen. It gave her a sexy, breathless look when it parted to reveal a little of her front teeth. He found himself quickly hardening as they kissed, stroking up and down her body with one hand while their tongues slid languidly against each other.

She seemed to be scared of his teeth but he opened them and coaxed her to explore. She actually nicked herself with a little squeak but he didn't release her and the tiny wound was healed by his saliva in seconds. Reminded of her previous run-in with the windshield glass, he released her lips and sought out all the tiny scratches on her arms and face, licking them briefly until all traces were gone.

She still smelt of angst and fear. His dragon hated it, wanted to make that smell fade away entirely.

He continued stroking her side, occasionally running the hand between them to her soft, slightly padded tummy. Susan wasn't thin like Annabel; she was softer, her belly a little rounded, more giving and her breasts and hips much fuller. Chris was tempted to cup those full, enticing orbs through her shirt but that might be too much, he only wanted to sleep with her tonight, not actually <I>sleep with her. </I>

Susan was breathing heavily as he finally broke away, turning to retrieve his phone before rolling back to her. Seeping up form between the covers came the musky scent of her readiness. It was heady and powerfully womanly, thick in his nostrils and tantalizing on his partially reptilian tongue.

<I>My god, she's beautiful, what does she see in me? </I>he asked himself.

He captured the image of her upturned, expectant face with her long black hair arrayed behind her. She had such a pleading look in her blue eyes, like she really wanted it but had resigned herself not to ask. It almost undid him so he dialled the phone, placing it against his ear with one hand so he could still look at her and hold his other at the tapering of her waist.

Susan saw him struggle, like he almost gave in and would have taken her, before he pulled back. It was agony for her. She hadn't even dared to hope he would let them sleep together so soon, let alone that he would let them have sex.

Now she was so hot it was ridiculous. She'd seen him sniff and flick his tongue slightly and she knew that he knew she was soaking wet. Her long-neglected womanhood craved his touch and seemed to be making up for lost time. She could feel it, hot and moist, already matting her thick, curly hair with moisture and soaking the pair of underwear she'd worn to bed. She felt achy, needy, even gave an experimental clench of her internal muscles and pressed her legs together, almost moaning at the little flash of stimulation it provided. His wood-smoky scent was thick in her lungs too, making her bold. She realized as he waited for the phone to be answered that she had to at least ask.

"Hello, babe! God, I've missed you." Annabel answered excitedly. She'd been waiting for his call all day, but attempted to convince herself she wasn't.

"I miss you, too, Dee. I wish you were here. You'd have loved to see London but we barely even stopped. Maybe next time." Chris was still watching Susan beside him.

"Yeah, next time. Anyway how was your trip?" she asked. She couldn't be sure but his voice sounded a little deeper and slightly hissy. Perhaps he was in his dragon form again.

"Well, honestly it was going great until some ass-hats attacked us..." Chris started, reluctantly admitting the afternoon's misadventure.

"What!? Are you okay?" She was suddenly breathing heavily as pulses of adrenaline entered her blood, an ugly churning started in her stomach.

"Yes, I'm fine," Chris chuckled, "I'm talking to you, aren't I?"

"Shut up, you ass, what happened? Is Susan okay? What about Lillian?" She was miffed that he would laugh at her concern.

"Lillian's fine. Susan..." He paused, looking meaningfully at her.

She was listening but could only pick up snippets of Annabel's voice. She gave him a nod, signalling that she was okay, too, at least she would be. He squeezed her waist gently in reply.

"Susan's going to be okay, she's right next to me actually, we... ah... we're in bed together."

"That's fine, Chris." Annabel almost instantly understood Susan's desire to be close to him, she knew she would always seek him out for safety and comfort. "What happened?"

"Well, we were just driving along this road and suddenly Lillian stepped on the gas, shouting about a car behind us. Mom said something about there being someone trying to kill the engine with magic and then they shot at us."

"Oh my god!" Annabel breathed.

"Yeah, it was crazy. Well anyway, I kinda' flipped out then, my dragon was so angry I barely knew what I was doing. Before I could even think I was in the Ether, then flying down on top of the car. They tried to shoot me through the roof, they hit my wing, it's fine now by the way. Anyway, I had this idea that it would be great if I had a grenade, you know like in a game?" 

"Uh-huh..." Annabel listened, rapt with fear and suspense.

"Next thing I know, I'm slamming this purple ball right through the roof and taking off again. It melted a hole right through the metal. Then there was an explosion and all this purple shrapnel came flying out of the car before it crashed into a tree." Chris paused there, realising he was about to admit to killing four men.

"Shit, what happened next?" Annabel asked.

"They were dead, Annabel." Chris said slowly, tempted for a moment to leave it there. But he couldn't lie to her like that, not about something like this. "Well, one of them was barely alive. I asked him why he did it, who sent him, but he just said to fuck myself. It made me so mad, Dee, I don't even know why but I snapped his neck just like that. The worst part is I can't bring myself to care. I care that I don't care about it but I just can't bring myself to feel for them after what they tried to do."

Annabel didn't respond at first. "S-so... you don't know who they were?"

He swallowed nervously before continuing. "Lillian says that two of them were humans who look like they work for the government. It's strange though, apparently there's no reason they should have been involved, and they weren't familiars. She pretty much told me to man the fuck up and get over it. Then we drove off to meet Lord Guthrie."

There was silence on the other end of the line as Susan rubbed his chest comfortingly.

"You're scared of me now." Chris could feel it.

"Well, yeah, Chris, I'm a bit scared. You were attacked and killed four people with a fucking magical grenade," Annabel replied quietly.

Chris sighed, "I'm sorry Annabel, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm scared, too, don't hate me." 

Her breath came out in a surprised rush. "Of course I don't hate you, you idiot. I love you. It's just a shock, I'm glad you can defend yourself and us it's just... I wish you didn't have to, alright? But if someone tries to kill you, you kill them right back. It's a bit disconcerting that you say you don't care about killing them but I think I can understand that. They tried to kill you after all, right? I mean I know it isn't how society is supposed to work but it makes sense, doesn't it?"

"Yeah, I guess," Chris mumbled.

"Hey, I'll always love you, no matter what happens. Remember that."

"Thanks, Dee, it means a lot. I'll always love you, too."

"Okay, well, how was it to meet other dragons. Were they nice?" Annabel asked, trying to cheer him up.

"Yeah, it's good. Elizabeth, Lord Guthrie's wife, got a bit touchy with me but apparently it's all about getting to know what my dragon's like. She said I'd make a perfect mate for someone called Claire Godran and insinuated that her mother Petra would want some, too. Then she called Petra and gave her my details, she's going to call once I get back apparently. We talked about all sorts of dragon stuff, much of it makes a lot more sense now."

"Wow, stud. They work fast huh? They must really want some more dragon babies," Annabel teased.

They'd discussed his likely mating to other dragons before he'd left. Annabel understood it was unavoidable but stuck to her philosophy about bridges. Ultimately, she knew she held a special place in his heart, that he would come back to her bed at the end of the night even if he had "graced" other women's beds with his presence. His confessions and honesty about killing those men and knowing of two possible mates was proof of that to her. She was becoming more comfortable with him as a dragon, understanding his nature and that he would always have his fierce love for her.

"Yeah, there's this whole weird 'balance' issue around how Beings reproduce, I'll tell you about it later. How are your parents by the way?"

"Well, my dad's still being an ass. He actually asked if I'd let you fuck me. Can you believe that? Those were his exact words. 'So, you let him fuck you, didn't you?' " Annabel imitated in a mocking, deep voice. "What an ass. Anyway I just told him yes, that it was awesome and stomped off into my room. Mom was great, though, she could tell we love each other just by looking at me. She's happy for me but I could tell she wanted us to get married. I... I ah, might have told her we were engaged. That's alright, right? You'll marry me?"

"Uh..." Chris felt like he'd been hit in the stomach with a bag of bricks but he quickly recovered. "I never thought a woman would ask me over the phone. I think it's a little too soon, don't you? I mean we're so young, what will people say?"

Annabel sighed into the phone, knowing he was just being a dick.

He chuckled. "Of course I'll marry you, Annabel. We're already bound together for life, if you hadn't noticed."

Susan let out a happy squeak, smiling brightly up at him.

"Ugg, I did notice, actually." Annabel muttered, glancing at Bartholomew peeking out of her shirt at her shoulder. "The little shit's been trying to introduce himself to everyone I meet! Creeping up towards my arms when I'm talking to Mom. I must look so weird when I slap myself to make him stop. Anyway, it's almost lunchtime. Thanks for calling and for agreeing to marry me, I know it's not, you know, like a proper romanticized proposal but it'll mean a lot to my parents." 

"Okay, Dee, I love you. We're cutting it short because of the attack so I'll be back in about a day hopefully. Say hi to Oslo..."

"Let me talk to her, Chris," Susan said, startling him a little.

"Oh, ah, Susan wants to talk to you." Chris handed the phone to his mother.

"Congratulations, Annabel!" Susan bubbled, "But shouldn't you have asked me for his hand first?"

"You're so old-fashioned," Annabel teased back. "You're okay, though, Susan? I mean, after all that stuff on the road."

"Yeah, I think I'll be fine, I was so scared though and angry at him for being impulsive. He's been great though, holding me. I feel much better now." Susan pausing as Chris resumed stroking her. "Annabel," Susan panted a little. "I wasn't going to but now he's touching me and I have to ask... Can I? I mean can we?..."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
"Yes," Annabel answered honestly, instantly knowing what Susan wanted. It was okay and that she couldn't deny Susan any longer. 

"Thank you." Susan sighed in relief. 

"Enjoy, Susan. Bye."

Annabel hung up, realized she was still happy, and went downstairs to help her Mom set out lunch.

***

Susan practically threw the phone onto the floor with a happy squeal, "Yes!"

She sat up, pulling her old t-shirt over her head, throwing it over by the phone. Her full tits jiggled right in Chris's face.

"What are you doing?" Chris was mesmerized by the beautiful display of bouncy flesh.

"<I>We</I>, are going to finally make love!" Susan pronounced. Her entire body was ready for it, over-ready. "Annabel said it's okay."

Chris didn't bother talking as he kicked off his sweatpants and sat up, too, kneeling on the bed so he faced her, eyes drawn to his breasts as he placed his own legs outside of hers, trapping them, his erection resting in the valley between her thighs, pointed directly at its moist target.

"You're sure about this?" he asked, stopping his hand half way towards her breasts. Despite what he'd said a few days ago about taking it slow with her, kissing and touching her so lovingly over that time had weakened his resolve to the point they were at now. If she wanted it, he wouldn't stop himself.

"Hurry up!" Susan wailed, watching his hand stop mid-air. She thrust her chest out at him not daring to look further down at his huge erection in her lap. "Touch them."

It was more than enough of an invitation for Chris. His hands shot forwards to cup her lovely breasts, filling his purple hands, satisfying but not overflowing much. He squeezed firmly and Susan moaned, pressing herself into him. She was so soft in his hands and he felt her nipples stiffen quickly against his palms. It was too much; he had to have them in his mouth.

Chris pushed her down onto her back, watching his mother's boobs bounce and sway. She giggled happily as he crawled up her body, between her splayed legs until his face was in her chest. For a minute he simply rubbed his face against the soft mounds, feeling her smooth flesh bend and give against his cheek or his chin, then he brought his hands back up to play with her as well, resting on his elbows with some of his weight pushing her into the bed.

Her breasts were much larger than Annabel's, still firm but nowhere near as pert. They splayed very slightly to the sides or downwards if he didn't support them with his hands. They were a different shape, too; where Annabel's small breasts were perfectly rounded with tiny button nipples, Susan's entire breasts were more pointed, a softened cone-shape. The tips of the cones were taken up entirely by her pebbled areolas, topped by larger, succulent looking nipples. He eventually opened his mouth and sucked greedily on the milky flesh just to the right of her brown areola.

"Yes! Oh, Chris, it's been so long. Suck them, please, kiss them!" Susan moaned as his suction sent shivers up and down her body, twitching underneath him.

He did just that, gently sucking and kissing all the flesh he could lay his lips on except her nipples, what she really wanted. She was moaning throatily as he would manipulate whichever breast wasn't entertaining his mouth with a firm hand or teasingly pull his claws over her contours, careful never to scratch her. Her white skin, freckled slightly with the occasional brown beauty sot soon reddened, responding to his touch.

"Don't tease, Chris!" Susan begged. Where her son had learned that certain sexual art she couldn't fathom; all she knew was that if she didn't get her nipples in his mouth she would go nuts.

Chris relented, enclosing her firm right nipple in his hot mouth while he gently tweaked her left between two fingers. He sucked quite hard, feeling her flesh pull into his mouth, giving and shaping around his sharp teeth. 

"Ahhh! Chrrriiisss!" Susan wailed, feeling him pull heavily on her teat.

She thrust her chest at him forcefully, arching her back off the bed and making fists in his short, purple hair to pull him closer. Her eyes closed tight at the deep pleasure she felt, the danger of her soft flesh at the mercy of his tooth and fang. She even had a momentary urge to have him bite her before his tongue lapped around her pebbled areola and across her nipple delightfully.

The witch didn't realise she was on the verge of orgasm until the dragon suddenly switched sides, repeating his treatment on her left breast as he pinched her wet, swollen right nipple. The pull at her breast sent a jolt all the way down to her fluttering pussy. She bucked her hips upwards into the underside of his thick shaft, unintentionally bumping her clitoris into his hardness.

"Ohhoho myy god!" she moaned as it tipped her well over the edge.

Susan mumbled a little more but mostly shut her eyes tight and rode it out as her body jolted with pleasure, her insides experiencing spasms of heady satisfaction. She could feel how slick she was between her legs as her moisture spread into her curls. Chris held still, stayed latched onto her luscious tit as she moaned out her pleasure, grinding her crotch up into his, tickling his shaft delightfully with her warm forest. He released her gently once her orgasm died down.

"Wow, Mom. I didn't know women could actually come from that," Chris murmured almost reverently. He was nuzzling her breasts as he spoke, almost like he was talking to them rather than her.

"I didn't either, but my little friend in the boat certainly helped," Susan breathed, chest heaving and glistening from his tongue. She pulled him up to kiss his forehead, then his lips gently. "And don't you dare call me Mom when we have sex." 

"I'll call you whatever I like," Chris teased, "and I do like it."

The taboo aspect somehow exciting him now rather than being repulsive. She was beautiful and they loved each other; the rest was white noise at this point. Breaking away, he returned to suckle at her fantastic boobs again.

"You're a monster," Susan moaned as he tongued and sucked her nipples again, more gently this time. "Do you like them? They're a 36C, know what that means? My right one is a bit bigger though." Susan waxed educational.

"Really?"

He pulled back to study Susan's breasts closely, cupping them then letting them go to watch them quiver and settle. Susan smiled up at him as he explored her body, laying her arms above her head so he could spot the difference more easily. Like this, her right breast sat a little lower on her chest, weighed down slightly over the years by its additional mass.

"Huh, that's cool. Of course I like them, can't you tell? And yes, it means you're thirty-six inches around here," he said, gripping her just below her breasts and around her sides. "And C is the cup size, large but not huge."

"Well, aren't you knowledgeable," she cooed, wrapping her arms up around his neck.

"I've done my research," he said against her lips as he laid his body more completely on top of her, his hard penis hinting how deeply he would soon penetrate her. 

Susan felt his hot dick on her belly and gave a teasing wriggle, spreading her legs a little wider. "Oh, yeah? Well, who's do you like better, mine or Annabel's?" she asked seductively.

Chris saw the pitfall for what it was and stepped around it. "Yours are certainly bigger and obviously very sensitive, but you're both absolutely beautiful and Annabel's suit her perfectly."

Susan chuckled huskily, "Good answer. Now please, let's get on with it, it's been so long, I can't wait!"

"How long?" Chris asked after they broke an open-eyed kiss, caressing each other's bodies lovingly. He stroked down her sides and out across her smooth, opened thighs, making her skin tingle and shiver.

"Far too long, ever since we fled. So go slow alright? You've got a lot to fit in me. Okay?"

"It's not that big, is it?" Chris asked. He'd tried to be gentle with Annabel but that was her first time; now Susan seemed apprehensive, too, and he didn't want to hurt her.

"It's pretty damn big, Chris," Susan smirked at her son and kissed his lips reassuringly, surely he knew that he was very well hung. "You need to be careful with your partners until they get used to you. Never push too hard if you come up against something. I know you'll always be a caring, considerate lover... unless of course she wants something else from you."

He kissed her, feeling her smile against his lips. Even with his experience with Annabel, he was thankful for her reassurance and advice. He was about to reach for her panties and position himself when another idea came to him.

"Got it, Mom, but..." He grinned cheekily. "I'm afraid you're going to have to wait just a little bit longer, though. I really want to taste you."

"Can't we do that later?" It was nice that he wanted to, but right then she wanted sex, just plain, old, "Tab A-Slot B" sex.

"Nope. It's gotta be now."

Chris kissed down her neck and across her pointy tits again, right into her sternum. When he reached her soft, gently rolled tummy, she giggled, obviously quite ticklish.

"Besides," Chris started boldly, knowing he'd probably get slapped as he finished the sentence and continued his journey down her sexy body, "I've got to check there aren't any cobwebs."

"Oh, you little shit!" Susan laughed, tugging his hair in retaliation as the big, strong dragon offered a playful yelp. Inside, she loved that he could be this relaxed and playful with her. "I'll forgive you because I'm your mother but you'd better lick me good."

Still grinning, he pressed his hot tongue firmly into the seam of her moist panties, tasting her for the first time through the fabric. It stopped any further words leaving her mouth for a while as he played up and down her slit.

Her fragrance was in his nose and on his tongue, the air thick and warm with her steamy essence, a little salty and slightly earthy, she lacked the tangy sweetness he'd come to associate with Annabel. However, she had a slicker, somehow buttery texture which was just as enticing in its own right; this was the taste of her pleasure and he would happily lap that from her all day.

Chris decided to make their first time together last, teasing her large, pouty labia through her panties and kissing up her soft thighs till she grabbed his head and shoved him back into her nest. Her long, unkempt black curls splayed around the edges of loose underwear, the entire area was damp and the dark hairs plastered down against her smooth, sensitive skin.

When using a bit of force didn't work, Susan begged more than a little, quivering and panting. "Please, Chris, please...!"

Finally, he relented and started pulling the silky fabric up her legs and off her ankles. Her face brightened so much he almost felt bad for teasing her so long. Almost.

She let her legs fall open heavily and Chris moved in close for his first view of his mother's excited pussy. She was indeed one hundred percent natural; a thick mat of soft raven curls covered her pubis. Her puffy lips were thick, and furred with longer, straighter hairs. Those juicy lips guarded her deep pinkness which was just visible.

Susan looked down to see him staring, instantly embarrassed that she'd misjudged his enthusiasms for her thick muff. She leaned forward on her elbows to explain.

"I haven't needed to but I'll start trimming for you, Chris, Annabel said she keeps them cut back and off her vagina?"

"Don't you dare." Chris said fervently, looking up form between her legs, a huge toothy grin on his purple face, his wings splayed slightly in the backdrop. "You're amazing like this."

"I thought.."

"Shhhh."

Chris lowered his mouth onto her; he maintained eye contact until he sunk his tongue between her crinkled inner lips and she gasped in delight, her head falling back to the bed.

"That's it, yes! Go deeper."

He obliged, pushing deep at first, his tongue attempting to touch everything it possibly could. He wriggled it against one velvety wall, then another, all the while savouring her taste and slickness. Susan again forced his head down whilst pushing off the bed with her hips; she actually got a bit too forceful and Chris had to grasp her firmly at mid thigh, pushing her legs wide open and holding her down to modulate her bucking.

She whimpered unhappily, so he allowed her control over his head for a while in consolation. She moaned and guided his movements towards her peeking clitoris. There, nestled happily in its hood and surrounded by her pubes, Chris's forked tongue found the excited little bud. He pushed the broad, flat part against it, drawing it over her, tracing imagined shapes across her sensitive nub while his nose was lost in the thickest part of her damp, womanly forest.

Susan writhed in ecstasy, her sensitive clit firing jolts up her body as his tongue crossed and re-crossed it. She felt something pressing into her and wailed happily, penetrated by his single finger. He was careful of his talon as he sunk his index finger between her hot folds. She was so slick it sunk in quickly, but he wriggled inside her and that was all it took as she screamed out her pleasure.

Her body seemed to undulate, muscles tensing and releasing rhythmically while her soft channel clutched at his finger. She pushed his head down into her greedily, humping into his face for a while and pulling his hair, finding the ridges of three bumps behind his temples where his horns would grow with her scrabbling fingers. Chris slowed his tongue on her clit and she eventually pushed him off, oversensitive.

As she recovered, splayed open with her eyes staring at the ceiling and her chest heaving and wet, Chris took the opportunity to examine her juices on his finger. He was by no means a connoisseur but it was definitely thicker than Annabel's, slightly cloudy and very slick, almost viscous as he watched it stretch between his thumb and forefinger before lapping it off. He couldn't wait to have the same stuff coating his erection, facilitating their lovemaking.

"Holy shit," Susan breathed, a small quiver running her melted body."You're going to fucking kill me when we have sex Chris, I came so hard on just your finger."

As she spoke, he lowered his head back to her hot, inflamed flesh, laying little kisses up and down each of her engorged labia, teasing them between his lips. They looked so plush and edible, with her pubes making a dark halo around the pink flower.

"Hey, let me return the favor," Susan said weakly.

"Uh-uh," Chris shook his head, grinning into her heat, gripping her soft, relaxed thighs and pushing them a little higher and wider, watching how the movement changed the shape of her wonderful pussy, making her lips open a little and revealing a full, glistening sheen of her lubrication coating her pink insides. He couldn't wait to be inside her. 

"How come? That's not fair." Susan lay back as the dragon explored her body. She was happy to let him play and learn.

"You'll get a chance later," he chuckled at her almost whiney tone.

Next he brought her legs together up towards her chest, until her knees touched, but let her lower legs flop to the sides limply. He looked down and simply stared. Like this, her ripe vagina was crushed obscenely into an exaggerated pout, her inner frill barely peaking out between those puffy lips while her black curls spilled outwards onto her smooth, creamy thighs. It was the most brutally sexual thing he'd witnessed, absolutely beautiful as her pussy was squeezed out between her closed legs. He had to have her exactly like that.

"Stop staring at it." Susan wriggled as he didn't move for almost half a minute.

"Mom, it looks so perfect like that," Chris said reverently. "Hold still okay? I'm going to put it in."

He took her hands and replaced his own under her knees. Hands freed, he shuffled forwards until his thighs were flush to her ass and his erection bobbed between them.

"Are you ready?" he asked, arching his butt back to give himself room to position the tip against her lips. They parted automatically, accepting just a little of him into her moist heat until he would need to apply some force.

"Do it already." Susan panted, feeling his warmth against her.

Chris brought his hand around to hold her hips, pushed a little and his flared head slowly pressed her open, approaching the point of maximum resistance. He looked down between them, watching her swallow him up with rapt attention. Suddenly it was past her portal and his shaft sank in quickly, surprising him. He let out a loud grunt of pleasure as his sensitive helmet felt the quick, hot friction of her tight channel for the first time.

Susan grunted as the dragon practically skewered her with little resistance.

"Fuck! Slow, Chris! Slow."

"I didn't mean to, Mom," Chris panted at the exquisite pressure and warmth surrounding fully half his cock. "You're so damn slippery, it just went in."

"I know, sweetie, just try to take it slowly."

Susan felt a little stuffed, her vagina not used to penetration, let alone something as thick or long as Chris. They held still for a while until she was ready.

"Okay, try a little more."

He inserted a bit more into her slowly, pushing deep, but she stopped him with her hands on his thighs.

"That's quite enough for now," she huffed. "Oh, wow, that's ... oh yeah, that's so good... I can feel you all the way inside me."

He still had at sizable length left outside her but she was snug, slippery and absolutely hot against his sensitive, hard flesh, sending carnal pleasure coursing all over his erection and up to his brain. Her coaching and praises fell on relatively deaf ears. Chris was transfixed by the lewd image of his thick cock parting her pink lips wide between her closed legs. He was pulling back slowly before realising it, watching her strained labia drag slightly backwards with him, then thrusting forwards again, making Susan gasp.

"Gently, Chris," she coached breathily, her breasts beginning to jiggle just slightly as he began his paced thrusts. "I'm not used to this, remember."

"I know, Mom, you feel so good though. I love you." Chris panted at the strain of holding off, his dragon wanted to just fuck this beautiful woman really hard.

She saw the almost pained look on his face and knew he was holding back. "I love you, too, Chris, you feel amazing inside me...mmmn. Yes! Just slow like that feels so good!... uunnnh... I'm really full but I'll get used to you soon, baby, then you can go a bit faster."

He took her legs in his hands again, holding them in his now favourite position as he ploughed in and out with long, slow thrusts. Every time he pulled back until he saw the ridge of his crown between her lips, holding for a second before sinking back in, letting her get used to him, and never pushing past the point she'd indicated.

She was already panting, moaning with each thrust, her pussy gripping him every now and then. It was so wet, as he pulled back, he could see a slick sheen on his erection up to the point of his deepest penetration where it formed a milky ring around him. He paused his thrusts momentarily, reaching down to wipe some off with his thumb. He brought it to his mouth to taste before resuming his leisurely pace, determined to have Susan come at least twice on him.

Barely five thrusts later, her juices were back around him, worked into a fine lather by their friction at her lips. She marked him like a dipstick as he strove to test her pleasure levels. Chris thought of it as a sexy little quirk of her individuality and proceeded to slightly increase his pace, sheathing himself into his gorgeous stepmother and loving every second.

His desire to kiss her won out after several minutes and he let Susan's legs fall, splaying wide against the bed, he leaned in and claimed her mouth as he continued fucking her slowly, almost teasingly, muffling her grateful moans with his lips.

--------------------------------------------
Susan kissed back enthusiastically, happy he'd gotten over his little obsession with watching her pussy. She reached to grasp his sides as he wound one hand in her long hair and cupped her breast with another. This was exactly how she wanted him, pressing down on her while he made love to her entire body. He'd hit his stride, firm, paced thrusts into her gripping warmth, and she could feel a pressure building deep inside her. She was going to have a massive orgasm soon and revelled in its inevitability.

She whimpered, thrust her hips forwards to take him a bit deeper, digging her nails into his back a little and raking across his wings. That really seemed to set him off, making him break his kiss to look into her eyes as they built towards release.

She sweated more, exchanging brief, hard tongue-filled kisses until their movement forced them apart for breath. Chris felt Susan start to tighten around him and maintained his pace for her. The problem was, he was now just as on edge as she was. She was so slick and warm, tight, too. Her pussy massaged him exquisitely, especially his sensitive head which traversed the entire length of her cavern and lodged in her tight depths at the end of every thrust. Now he twitched and his testicles churned ominously; he prayed she was really close.

As Susan felt her son begin to thicken a little further, swell slightly and become harder, she keened in triumph, knowing their mutual orgasm was just around the corner. She gripped him tight.

"Yes Chris! ... mmmnn... You're so good! Fuck! Come with meee!... I want to feel it... don't, don't pull out. I... I need you inside me!"

She barely got the words out as he thrust harder and she fell into absolute bliss, pleasure wracking her body as she orgasmed underneath him, the most powerful of her life. Susan felt her mind blank briefly in overload, too pleasured to hold any other thoughts. Her mouth hung open with a loud gasp of breath before she absolutely screamed her joy, "Chriiisss!!?"

Her cry died with a strangled gurgle as her climax continued to roll through, curling her toes and almost cramping her feet as she looked up at him with amazed, wide, blue eyes, barely managing to keep them open as her insides churned and fluttered around his thrusts, so slick now that her tight spasms couldn't slow him. 

It didn't matter. He was already roaring in her ear, his reptilian face set in a snarl of satisfaction. He clutched her soft body to him a little painfully as he pushed his magnificent cock deep, jerking his hips into her with each of the powerful jets it released, snarling and panting like a beast.

As soon as his scalding, magically-imbued sperm hit her insides, she felt the zing of energy rushing through her body. She greedily absorbed all he would give her, whimpering and breathing heavily into his ear as her orgasm continued, sending elation speeding through her body with each spurt.

Chris panted into her neck as she drained him, practically milking his erection with her undulations and her writhing body. Waves of pleasure crashed over him; he felt every twitch pass through his cock as its spasms sent his seed forcefully on its way to Susan's womb. When it died down with a few weak dribbles, so sensitive he didn't dare move it, he collapsed down onto her sweaty breast, head next to hers on the bed with their ears pressed together.

She still quivered and clutched at him as he regained his senses. He was still hard inside her. That was something new.

"Oh shit... wow... oh, Chris," Susan breathed as he pushed himself up on his elbows to look down at her sweaty, satisfied body. "That was amazing. The best. I can't believe it's true! Your come set me off instantly, I can feel my entire body humming with your magic. I swear I could cast, like, fifty spells right now."

She was giddy, like a young girl again as the beautiful dragon looked down at her lovingly.

"Thanks, Mom, you felt fucking amazing, too. I'm so glad we did this, I love you." He kissed her a little, nuzzling into her neck and damp hair before teasing her again. "Your pussy is super slippery, by the way, and also really tight. It felt <I>so </I>good to cream inside you."

He gave an experimental thrust with to accentuate his point.

"That's no way to talk to your mother," Susan giggled happily.

"Oh, so you want to be my mother all of again all of a sudden?"

"Ha! You don't seem to care." Susan smiled. "I know I get really wet though, I've always been like that. Some guys didn't like that I get kind of white and a little frothy."

Chris was surprised and a little annoyed at those faceless jerks. How could anyone not enjoy that about this lovely, sexy woman.

"Well, that's stupid. I think it's hot and it feels awesome." 

"Thanks, honey," Susan cooed.

"Okay, why don't you roll over so we can go again?"

"Chris, I'm not sure I can handle another round," Susan said tentatively. She'd just had the most intense sex of her life, the first real encounter in about fifteen years and now he already wanted to go again? From behind, no less!

"Please, Mom, I'm still hard. I promise I'll make you come again." The purple dragon coaxed, reaching down to hold her waist has he began thrusting gently in and out again, stirring her embers into flame once more.

"Mmmm..." Susan went limp for a few moments to enjoy his cock moving inside her. "Okay, okay!" she laughed, feeling him rubbing delightfully inside her again, still stuffing her full with his hard girth. "Alright, you've twisted my arm. Let me up, baby."

Chris quickly pulled out and let her up, looking down at his oily erection as she got on all fours and pulled her raven hair down one side of her neck. She looked over her other shoulder and smiled at him.

"Come on, big boy, what are you waiting for?"

She gave a seductive wiggle of her wide hips, her big, squishy, white ass jiggling slightly in the air, with her creamed pussy ready and willing to take him again.

"I'm not going to hold back this time," he warned as he rose up behind her, his penis in hand, ready to be positioned.

His warning sparked delightful shudder to work its way up her spine, all the way to the tips of her ears. Her body tingled in its wake and she let out a wonton moan of encouragement.

He seated his pointed crown in between her lips again and grabbed two handfuls of her giving ass. Then he pulled her back slowly onto him with a groan as she enveloped him once more. He didn't stop as she shuddered and whimpered in response to his depth, mating completely until his helmet butted the entrance to her womb. He only had a little left outside her this time. 

Susan felt him filling her completely this time, going all the way. She let out a huff of air when he was as deep as he could get before looking back at him.

"No one's ever done that to me, Chris. Fuck, I'm so damn full! Remember, not too hard."

"I'll remember," said the dragon. "But I'm really going to fuck you this time."

Susan could only smile back at the purple beast penetrating her. She knew was dealing with more of the dragon this time. His thrusts started out slowly, thankfully letting her get used to the new position and his increased depth but it didn't last long. Soon enough he was pumping into her, pushing almost his entire length in and out of her.

Chris grabbed great handfuls of Susan's bubbly ass, kneading the flesh greedily and using it to pull her down onto his thrusts, making her squeal or grunt each time he was all the way inside her. It felt amazing to slip his entire length into her quickly, sexy to make the air huff from her lungs, knowing she couldn't take any more of him.

He was still on his knees behind her, looking down at the shape of her butt, his now froth-coated cock pulling a vanishing act inside her constrictive, hot pussy. Her tapered waist and smooth back were a beautiful backdrop as his hands mauled her rosy flesh. Then Chris saw a new target for his hands: the little soft bits of jiggling flesh where her legs met her hips, so succulent and giving as her position on all fours exaggerated them. He reached out to hold them, being more gentle than he was with her ass; they were satisfyingly soft and giving, he proceeded to use them to fuck her a little faster, making her ass shake.

Susan couldn't help but moan like a whore. Chris, her son, was truly fucking the shit out of her! She could feel him as he shoved his thickness in fast and deep, stretching her, filling her all the way up only to pull back just as quickly. Somehow he had his thrusts measured to just gently touch the tip of his cockhead against her cervix every fucking time, despite how fast or rough the rest of his penetration was.

Every time he filled her, there was so much friction she would moan or yelp out her pleasure, so much pleasure deep inside her that she felt her climax building too quickly. In the beginning she'd just let him fuck her but now she couldn't help but buck back as he squeezed her little love handles and took her like a common slut.

That naughty thought set her right off, squealing and tensing as another orgasm ripped up her body. 

"Gnnhhaaa!" She shoved back hard, impaling herself.

At least he had the decency to stop fucking her while she came, her back arching repeatedly with her abdomen tensing. Her vagina tried to coax him into orgasm as well but it was no use, his thick shaft remained rock hard, smug that it'd made her come alone. At least that's how it seemed to her.

With her eyes shut tight and her body arched back towards him, she gave in to the pleasure, rejoiced as it flowed through her. The dragon, behind and deep inside her, slipped a hand around her soft navel and up to her sensitive breasts, cupping one then feathering her nipple as her orgasm died and little shakes travelled her body, putting gooseflesh down her arms.

"Ohh, Fuck," Susan breathed, her upper body going limp, attempting to slump onto the bed. Chris caught her, pulling her back until she was upright against his chest.

"That... Chris... I don't know..." she mumbled, her mind addled with pleasure as he held her chest with one hand, stroking her flank soothingly with the other.

"Shhh, it's okay, Susan." He soothed into her damp hair, now disarrayed, falling down around her face and across her back.

He could tell that she'd had enough, but his dragon seemed particularly keen to continue breeding their new mate, the newest member of his brood. Instinctively he began a series of tiny thrusts inside her, slowly working on her as he increased their length.

She seemed a little limp in his arms, he held her across the chest with one hand on her full, right breast; the other was on her hip, guiding her onto his thrusts. She gripped both his purple forearms in response but didn't have much strength; her head lolled back against his shoulder and her eyes were closed, making cute little noises to the rhythm of their hips. With her back arched up into him, he couldn't go as deep but she felt a little tighter somehow.

Susan had resigned herself to just relaxing and letting him do all the work. Her body hummed with the magic he'd recently given her but her muscles were at the point of collapse. He clearly wasn't done with her but she was one too many orgasms past being an active participant. It didn't mean he couldn't fuck her though, a task he clearly intended to complete as he pushed his girth back and forwards, picking up his speed again. It also didn't stop her from enjoying it, his thick cock rubbing exquisitely against the sensitive front wall of her cavern in this new position. Her head tossed side to side every now and then, moaning as the relentless thrusting and deep fullness forced ripples of pleasure up her body. 

Chris felt his entire body tensing and quivering again as he sheathed his cock into this woman he loved dearly. He'd been close for a few minutes as he held her tight against his chest but held back a little as he enjoyed fucking her slick heat, not wanting it to end. However, he could feel her body was again working towards a reluctant orgasm and decided to race to the finish, picking up his pace until her ass made muffled slapping sounds against his hips.

Susan was practically wailing in his arms, limp and sweaty; she was so beautiful as they made love. His cock expanded again slightly in preparation and after driving himself deep into her two more times, the first thick ropes blasted out the end. 

"Rnngghaaa!"

The dragon growled into Susan's neck as he shot into her, wanting to inject her with his itch but holding back as his seed splattered against her hot walls. The intense pleasure wracked his body as she came, too, her pussy gripping him, fluttering a little weakly, she was tired out. 

Susan felt her orgasm tip over and smash like a vase on floor as his hot splashes hit her insides. She panted and whimpered a little as pleasure fired white behind her eyelids again and again with his pulses, her body tensing and her spent pussy clutching at him. He held her tight against his chest and growled contentment and satisfaction into her ear, claiming her.

Her body again coursed with his magic, she felt bloated with it, not used to dealing with so much energy at one time. It dawned on her then how much more powerful he was than her, if the energy he could give her like this was enough to charge her body to overflowing. To be loved and cherished by such a powerful Being was a gift and her feelings overwhelmed her a little.

"I love you, baby," she whispered, turning to kiss him where his mouth was against her ear.

The beast was finally satisfied as he spent inside her body a second time, felt his essence and scent merging with her, marking her. The dragon was happy that he'd initiated the beautiful female into his brood so thoroughly. They kissed for a few moments before Chris pulled his softening, glistening shaft from her. He laid Susan back in the right place on the bed before going to the bathroom for a washcloth. He cleaned himself, around his balls and pubis where their moisture had seeped, then went back to do Susan who murmured her thanks as her tired, flushed, blissfully melted body cooled.

Once he was back in bed, he pulled her into his chest, spooning her with her ass against his crotch.

"That was amazing, Susan. I love you." Chris kissed her damp hair and scented her deeply.

"Me, too, Chris," Susan responded, sounding groggy.

They were silent for a moment as she arranged his arm to wrap around her just below her tits, cupping the one nearest the sheet, relaxing in their post orgasmic stupor.

"Did you feel the energy I gave you?" Chris whispered. "The dragon put in quite a bit extra in for you, I think."

"It was too much Chris, I'm overflowing. Its seeping out of me."

"That's okay, it was a gift. Besides, the more I push your limits, the more you'll be able to hold. Think we can get you to Class 3?" Chris asked. "You can have more whenever you need it, you don't ever have to make contracts for my ahh... services?"

"Maybe," she giggled, "I could become class 3 in a few years if we try really hard." Then became more serious. "Are you really going to do that Chris? Have sex with other Beings for money so they can harvest your energy?"

"No," Chris sighed. "I think I'll stay away from those types. You and I can always just have sex, drain the energy into a gemstone and sell that. But I think we'll be fine for money, we just need to work out where we're going to live."

"I wish I had a gemstone now. This stuff is going to waste."

"Why don't you do something fun with it?" Chris asked.

Susan thought for a moment before she took her right hand out from under the covers, concentrating on the simple trick and drawing on the abundant energy coursing her body. Three little colorful balls of light grew at the tip of her index finger. She flicked them off and they flew around the room briefly before exploding in a silent shower of green, yellow, and red sparks. It illuminated the room with flashes of coloured light, casting strange shadows and making Chris smile and nuzzle the back of her flushed neck.

"We need to find a new house by the way. Reyla has cameras and bugs all through that apartment," Susan admitted, half expecting the dragon to flip out.

"So she's seen everything we've done," Chris said quietly as he ran his thumb across her soft skin. "Lillian knows?"

"She told me on the first day." Susan set off a few more tiny magical fireworks to use up her excess energy. It was relaxing to see the joyful, floating little lights. She imagined they felt just like she did in that moment. "She's bound to Reyla by a blood pact and hates it."

"I'm starting to get the impression Reyla's a real bitch."

"Yes, but she means well, I think. She's a control freak with a sadistic side but she's been good so far. We should start looking for a place to live though. It'll need to be secure but with easy access to where we work and not cost an arm and a leg. Hrmm... that sounds a bit like wishful thinking doesn't it?" Susan chuckled slightly, releasing the last of the lights into the air. She'd gotten rid of enough of his energy so that her body could hold the rest, saving it for later use.

"Maybe, but we can do magic, remember?" Chris mused quietly. "Speaking of which, when can I learn to do stuff like those little fireworks?"

"Well, I suppose there's nothing stopping you but remember, wrote learning hundreds of spell is the way humans do it. Our main advantage is a quick understanding and control of magic, not great powers. Dragons and the other mingled Beings have a harder time with that. Instead you use your magically-enhanced bodies to do things. But, Chris, you did some pretty powerful magic this afternoon." 

"The grenade thingy? It was just an idea, I didn't know it would actually happen," Chris murmured, enjoying the feel of Susan repositioning her naked body slightly closer against his.

"Yeah, it takes quite a lot of energy to make an explosion like that. That's what I mean though, a dragon's aspect magic is powerful and intuitive. You phased too, which is more of a physical thing though."

"Hey, if I learned to phase properly, could I take other people with me?" The beginnings of an idea formed in his mind.

"There's no reason you couldn't. It might take a bit of energy but you managed to pull me into the Ether on that first day, after all. That's the first step in phasing. Why? What do you have planned?" Susan could almost hear his mind ticking over behind her but was too damn tired and content to bother turning to look at his face. "Don't go trialling your ideas until you know what you're doing. Magic can be dangerous and unforgiving."

"Don't worry, Mom, I think I've just come up with a place for us to live."

With dim, high latitude sunlight streaming through the windows onto his face, Chris woke the next morning with his nose against Susan's forehead. She'd turned in the night to face him, and now their limbs were entwined around each other. He kissed her forehead tenderly, so happy in the wake of the night before. She looked absolutely beautiful in the soft light, so peaceful, he'd never had the chance to study her up close and he just stared at her for a few minutes.

Susan woke up as the dragon tickled her nose with his flattened snout, searching for her lips with his. It was startling to wake in someone's arms, something Susan hadn't experienced for far, far too long. However, they did end up kissing and petting for about ten minutes. She ran her hands over him, feeling his smooth, scaled skin and the animal strength in the muscles beneath. She couldn't get enough of his smell and ended up sucking and nibbling at his collar bone where she the thought it was strongest.

The dragon chuckled at her wanton little noises while he dragged his hand over her back, squeezing her ample ass. Her sensitive breasts were flattened against him and his erection was making a small, slippery stain against her soft thigh before Susan reluctantly stopped them going any further. She rolled away from him suddenly with a quiet curse. They were already behind schedule.

--------------------------------------------
Everyone was showered and eating breakfast by eight o'clock. Lillian was hungry but there was no blood for her. She would have to feed tonight or get some blood today if she was going to stay one hundred percent around Chris. Her hunger reflected in her slightly cranky demeanor, although no one could see her scowls as she was invisible again.

Thankfully, their brief trip was already drawing to a close as the three dragons discussed various aspects of their lives, what possibilities lay at Chris's feet. Lillian observed the way Susan hovered around Chris even more today and had that happy, tell-tale glow about her. If those weren't enough, their combined moans and screams last night could have woken the dead, the undead anyway, if she'd actually been asleep.

Susan felt the vampire's eyes on her and returned a broad, happy smile in her general direction, feeling full of energy and love after her wonderful night with the dragon. Lillian tried to tell herself that she wasn't jealous of that contented look and happy smile. Was the dragon really that good?

Again, the conversation moved to the living room, centered on the subject of Chris's gold. John had made some dragon-gold of his own in his youth but gave it up once he established a respectable hoard, buried deep below the house. As a dragon, there were possibilities for much easier lucrative work. The older couple was enthusiastic about him starting to take his own contracts and begin his education as soon as possible.

"I'm only disappointed that the Global Meeting of Dragons is seven years away," John said, continuing before Chris could ask the obvious. "It occurs at the start of each decade."

Elizabeth shrugged. "Well, he will be meeting Claire and Petra before long and probably other dragons, too, in the meantime."

The elder dragon chuckled. "Oh, yes, and won't word spread quickly among us that there is a new member of the Endangered Club? An Ether dragon, no less." He looked from his wife to the youngling. "Take care of you and yours as you meld with your dragon, Chris. We want you around for a very long while."

***

They'd commandeered one of John Guthrie's cars, a powerful black Mercedes which was modified for safe transport of council members. This meant luxury and comfort as well as bulletproof glass, UV shielding, and all sorts of high tech devices inside.

Lillian was driving again, still hungry and grumpy, while Chris and Susan spent a lot of the trip back to London sitting together or just smooching in the back, thoroughly besotted with this new aspect of their relationship. Before they left the Guthrie residence, Chris had been assured that he could call them night or day about anything at all; and that once Petra and Claire Godran got in touch with him, he'd have another great source of knowledge.

He'd thanked them and said goodbye, having a brief argument with his dragon about going back into his human form. The dragon had thought it was more important to be safe if there were any more attacks than to have his big wings and purple skin alerting everyone to the presence of Beings as they drove past. Chris had won though, and now they were on the outskirts of London in the early evening. 

"What time's our charter flight?" Susan asked.

"We aren't going back on a scheduled flight, it's too easy for someone to get to us," Lillian explained from the front. "We'll take a public flight and no one will know. If anyone does find out there'll be hundreds of captive witnesses, they won't be able to do shit." Lillian had been on edge the entire drive, mulling yesterday's events over again and again. It didn't fit, someone had leaked information about their schedule which meant that they were still in danger. "We'll borrow a car from Lord Harcot, I'll get a meal, and then we'll get the first available flight out of Heathrow."

"Isn't that dangerous? How's Chris supposed to be on a plane for hours?" Susan thought the vampire's idea was a little foolhardy. "Wouldn't the Synod look after us and provide safe transport if we weren't happy with the charter?"

"Look!" Lillian hissed, her hunger and worry translating into an angry snarl. "We are in another country, with no one we can truly trust nearby. The people who are supposed to be helping us are the only ones who know we're here, yet we were attacked. That means someone is giving them information. Therefore, we need to get back to familiar territory as fast as possible, in ways that aren't predictable. That means human airlines, and if you think Chris will be a problem, we'll grab whatever you need to make a neutralizing agent for his fucking pheromones!"

Lillian breathed deep after her little rant, more out of reflex than necessity.

"Sorry," Chris said, hugging Susan who was terrified all over again after having their situation laid out in no uncertain terms. She'd thought they were in the clear after the failed attack. "We aren't used to all this. Thank you, Lillian."

"I didn't mean to yell," she replied. "I'm just on edge... and I'm really hungry."

***

Chris woke with a start, not believing he'd actually managed to fall asleep in the cramped seat, his knees jammed into the back of the one in front. The loud whine of the engines filled his ears. For a moment he just sat there with his eyes still shut until the little touch that had originally woken him repeated itself: a finger trailing down his thigh.

His eyes shot open to be met by a nice pair of brown ones, an unfamiliar pair, as their owner trailed her finger back up his leg.

"What are you doing?" he whispered accusingly to the flight attendant. He heard Lillian chuckle from the empty window seat and glanced across to her. Susan was still asleep in between them.

"I don't know, Christopher, why don't you come up behind the curtain with me?" she asked. 

Chris saw her nametag pinned onto her suit style jacket. Jenifer.

"No, thanks, and how do you know my name?"

Chris tried to wriggle back into the seat, reaching to push her back a little. She just grabbed his hand and placed it on her modest breast, holding it there firmly with a small coo as she leaned into him from the isle.

"What the fuck are you doing?" he hissed, angrily pulling his hand back. The cabin lights were down but she wouldn't go unnoticed forever.

"I looked you up in the passenger manifest. I don't know why but I really like you," Jenifer said seductively. "Let's have some fun, I think Linda likes you, too."

She really didn't know why she was assaulting this young man, risking her job, but it all seemed worth it somehow. He'd caught her eye as he'd shuffled past her down the aisle, trying not to bump people with his shoulders. He'd passed close and she'd gotten a whiff of whatever lovely cologne he was wearing.

"Fuck. Jenifer, look, just go back to your station. I don't want to do this and neither do you. You'd lose your job." Chris leaned over to Susan. "Mom, wake up."

Lillian's quiet titter sounded again.

"You couldn't have done anything about this, Lillian?" he asked, peeved that the invisible vampire seemed to find it funny.

"Come on ,Chris," Jenifer whined a little louder, gripping his arm and trying to pull him up out of his seat. "Don't all guys fantasize about joining the Mile High Club? No one will know, we can do it in the toilet."

His resistance only made her more desperate to convince him as her mind began to abandon reason only to be replaced by more lust.

"That's enough!" Chris said forcefully, noticing several passengers to start from sleep, a couple heads turning their way. "Get yourself under control, Jenifer, I don't want to do that with you."

He felt guilty as soon as he'd said it. It wasn't her fault, she probably just thought he was cute then got snared by his pheromones. She had a sad, hurt look on her face and the beginnings of tears in her eyes as she took a startled step back, like she'd never even considered he wouldn't reciprocate her advances. After a moment of looking sadly at him, she mumbled an apology and retreated up the aisle, arms wrapped around her torso.

"Jenifer... I...fuck." Chris almost got out of his seat to apologize but Susan stopped him.

"Don't. Just stay away, it'll be easier for her." 

"That's got to be the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me," Chris said, his heart calming down after the encounter.

"It's going to be hard to get used to." Susan paused, reaching under the seat in front of her to retrieve the small kit she always carried for making potions on the fly, this time literally. "Okay, we'd better go make up a neutralizing solution for her and anyone else you've affected. I'll follow about thirty seconds after you and knock on the bathroom door twice."

Chris tried to choose the largest bathroom but it was still tiny and smelled like piss. A few seconds later Susan knocked and he awkwardly let her in. They stood still for a moment, waiting for someone to knock on the door and demand they come out, but it didn't happen.

"So what do we do?" Chris started.

"Well, you know, I need some part of you to neutralize your essence." Her face transformed into a seductive grin. "Can you think of any way to get a sample of your essence? Humm?" Susan practically purred.

"You aren't... Seriously? Not in here, surely?" Chris stammered. 

"Oh, yes, you said I'd have a chance later. Now I'm taking my chance. Pants down, Chris."

Susan started on the buckle of his belt, turning to put the toilet lid down so she could sit while he backed up against the far wall, which wasn't far at all.

"Oh shit." Chris moaned as Susan dropped his jeans and reached inside his briefs, snagging his semi-flaccid cock and pulling out into the open.

"It's magnificent like this, too," she said reverently, gently pulling her hand up towards its thickening head and feeling him swell under her touch. It only took a few soft strokes to have him rock hard, pointing up at her face, twitching with anticipation. "Just tell me when you're going to come."

Susan leaned forward and placed her full, soft lips against the side of its head, licking firmly right across his sensitive ridge.

"Ahh..hholy shit," Chris hissed, trying to stay quiet as Susan looked up at him and moved to wrap her lips around his spongy head. He grunted as warmth surrounded him and she sucked slightly. "You have no idea how good that feels, Mom."

However, she didn't continue like this, rather moving back to kiss and lick down his length, even holding it above her and gently pulling each of his soft testicles into her mouth. She started to jerk back and forth on his wet shaft with one hand, stimulating down near his thick root while she nuzzled his balls. She cradled each in turn between her lips, sucking gently.

Susan found herself getting very turned on. He looked down at her with such adoration and his scent was especially thick all over his crotch, making him delightfully satisfying to taste. His flavor of salty wood smoke and sweet, hot, spices burst in her mouth when she coaxed a little dribble of pre-cum out of his thick cockhead. She knew she wasn't going to deep throat him, didn't have the desire or experience to do so, but she was going to enjoy getting him off with her hands and mouth. 

She'd had to stretch her lips wide around his girth to roll her tongue around his susceptible glans, making him jump and groan. He'd thoughtfully reached to hold her long, black hair out of her face and now his hands gently held her head but didn't guide her. Looking up, she watched as pleasured grimaces, astonishment, and pure lust played across his handsome face as he panted.

Susan took a bit more of him into her mouth, the head and more, little by little, until she couldn't proceed without risking gagging. Chris groaned deeply as she sucked firmly, wrapping her lips tight and pulling back up his turgid dick, coming free with a lewd pop. She just grinned hungrily and took him back inside her hot mouth, establishing a good pace while her hand continued to jack his lower half, twisting a little in her strokes.

Chris knew he was going to come soon. It was probably a good thing given their situation, the very situation which had him so wound up and excited. He was in a cramped airliner bathroom getting a wickedly hot blowjob from his own beautiful surrogate mother, the results of which would be used to stop various women on the plane from fucking him senseless against his will.

<I>How the fuck did it come to this? </I>he asked himself as his dick twitched, preparing to shoot his load as Susan locked her lips behind his crown and sucked furiously.

She was so silky and good sucking on his cock, jacking off the lower part and fondling his balls while her mouth wreaked havoc up around his helmet with her wicked tongue. Her mouth was ravenous, giving him so much pleasure he had to shut his eyes and arch back against the sliding door.

"Fuck, Mom, I'm gonna come any second," Chris warned, teetering on the edge as her tongue played across the underside of his shaft.

She barely managed to pull back in time, slipping her little glass vial flush against his hole as his unstoppable orgasm hit him in waves of bliss, rolling up and down his body as he shot off into the vial. He groaned as the pleasure renewed with each spurt, each violent clench of his muscles, felt all the way in his draining testicles. She was milking him like a prize stallion.

He opened his eyes in shock as the warm heat of her mouth returned, holding him captive as he finished, apparently having enough in her little vial. She sucked a little and Chris moaned again, so sensitive in the midst of his orgasm.

Susan felt a little bomb go off inside her as his last weak bursts splashed across her tongue, gumming up her mouth a little. The magic in his semen triggered a tiny orgasm down in her belly. She hummed happily around his cock as her blissful pussy fluttered lightly in approval.

He was thick and sticky on her tongue, again tasting exactly like he smelt but also salty and a little hot, like chilli and sweet cinnamon. It made her mouth warm and tingly as the magic was absorbed into her body. She released him with a final suck, swallowing down what little she'd gotten.

"That's a weird experience right there," she said happily, "you taste as delicious as you smell but it's sweet and tingles in my mouth, kind of like pop candy."

"Thanks?" Chris panted, regaining his composure and stuffing his wilting cock back in his underwear. "That is weird, though, I wonder what a female dragon is like. Did you like it?" 

"Of course, what's not to like? You taste great, make me come a little, and charge me with more magic than I know what to do with. Don't ever hesitate to ask for a blowjob, honey."

She tittered, still a little high on the small burst of magic she'd received.

"Well, I'll admit I never imagined those words ever passing your lips, or something else for that matter." Chris chuckled, pulling her up off the toilet seat and into his arms.

He leaned down to kiss her, uncaring if he tasted himself, apparently it was pretty good anyway. Susan kissed back hungrily, letting her tongue meet his between their lips and reaching up to play her hands through his hair as he cupped her face.

"Okay, don't we have a potion to make?" Chris breathed as he they finally broke away from each other, pulling his jeans back up.

Susan got the rest of the ingredients out of her little kit.

"What a waste," she murmured, holding up the vial of his thick, white come before adding a few drops of detergent, some powdered rosemary, a little water, and a few flecks of silver. She stoppered the vile before shaking it vigorously, infusing her will into the solution using the very energy he'd just given her.

A lot of their magic was simple, like this, ingredients were symbolic with the real magic coming from the well formed intensions and energy of the Being. For example, detergent and water were symbolic of cleaning and washing away while rosemary would give a strong scent to replace his pheromones lodged in someone's nose. Silver, like other precious metals or stones was a conduit for her magical energy, allowing her intentions to slip into the vial and do their work.

"Done," she announced, holding up the light purple coloured liquid. "Anyone who gets a drop on their skin should be immune to your charms for about a day."

"I guess we'll let Lillian do the honours on the crew then. Am I decent?" Chris asked, checking down his front for any evidence of their bathroom misadventure.

"Barely," she teased. "You're criminally handsome and you sap a woman's will to resist with powerful pheromones and insane, magical orgasms. You should really be locked away."

"Pftt," Chris exhaled. "It's way more trouble than it's worth. Let's get out of here before we get banned from flying with Star Alliance."

Susan giggled as they returned to their seats. She couldn't help it, she was too excited and now relieved that they were in the clear, that she hadn't gotten caught sucking her son's cock in an airplane bathroom. That might have been hard to explain. "Okay Lillian, just use this eyedropper to put a drop on the flight attendant's skin, and anyone else who gets frisky. Just be careful, it's got some silver in it."

Lillian was waiting for them, invisible and using her power to float at the top of the isle. She took the vial out of Susan's hand, sniffing it delicately, detecting the silver and feeling that little urge to sneeze as a result. Silver wouldn't kill a vampire unless it was a stake, but it would give her a burning rash if she touched it for too long, make her sick if she ingested it.

<I>Well, shit, there goes that plan, </I>she thought grumpily. She floated off to dose the heartbroken flight attendant as Chris and Susan settled back into their seats.

***

"Just wait a second, I really need to pee," Susan said hurriedly, walking briskly towards the toilets. They were just past passport control at JFK in New York, but something didn't feel right to Chris. There was a tingling at the back of his neck which set him on edge.

"Do you feel that?" Chris asked Lillian, invisible beside him. They were in a broad hallway leading to baggage claim. The plan was to check through to Denver on the next available flight.

"I feel something, perhaps the humans have found one of their terrorists."

"Dude, don't even say the T-word here."

Chris chuckled nervously, then, everything seemed to go into slow motion as the peaceful environment was ruined with shouts and violence. A security door up ahead burst open and five men in black tactical gear and body armour rushed out, weapons drawn. They fanned out as someone screamed; people were getting down on the floor with their hands above their heads. A door down the hall behind him banged open as well and another set of men wielding assault rifles advanced in his direction, followed by a man and woman in dark clothing touting pistols.

They were all human.

As they converged, it suddenly registered with him that they were shouting for him to get down on his knees. They were after him.

But why? He hadn't done anything to set the cops after him. Still, some of his ingrained human terror at being confronted by police with automatic weapons came to the fore and for a few seconds he forgot he was a dragon entirely.

He sensed Lillian about to leap into action, probably to kill them all before they knew their teammates were dying. That wouldn't help though, he'd be the most wanted man in the States. This had to be resolved without revealing the Secret. 

"Lillian, take Susan and get back to Denver," he said softly with a calmness he didn't feel inside. "Figure out what's going on and get Reyla to track me down." His dragon wanted to fight but Chris maintained in control. He couldn't just attack all these people in broad daylight at a busy airport.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 11|
--------------------------------------------
"I can't just let them take you," Lillian hissed, watching the dragon get on his knees with his hands behind his head.

The commandos were advancing very cautiously.

"And how will the deaths of the team sent to collect me help my situation? I'll look after myself and maybe we can figure out what the fuck is going on. We don't have any other choice." 

"But..." Lillian started.

"Go. Now," Chris whispered.

They were almost on him. Lillian stepped back, watching as a woman came forward and put thick cable ties around his wrists behind his back. As if they would hold a dragon. He was right though, she couldn't just kill all these men; it would spark a huge investigation. So reluctantly, Lillian retreated to the woman's bathroom to collect Susan.

"Christopher Baryst, you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit terrorism," said the olive skinned woman before lowering her voice. "I won't bother reading the rest of your rights. I doubt they actually apply to you, anyway."

Chris didn't say anything, just relaxed himself as they slipped a black hood over his face and dragged him up roughly. Someone came out of the bathroom saying that Susan wasn't there.

The woman cursed quietly. "Where is she?"

Chris smiled under his hood, "As if I'd tell you."

He expected to be hit or something, instead he was marched off. He sent out his senses, gathering any information he could as they led him back through one of the doors they'd come through. Down several hallways to a brief stop where the woman and man who were obviously in charge informed someone that his cooperation was much appreciated.

They loaded him into some sort of van, putting a linked bracelet and ankle cuff set on him and attaching it to several bolts in the floor, strapping him into his seat as well with wire mesh reinforced straps.

Chris felt and heard the other humans in the van with him; the woman who'd cuffed him and the man who appeared to be her partner, as well as two of the tactical guys, and someone driving. He thought about making a move now that they were more secluded but realized he had no idea what was outside the vehicle as it sped away.

He couldn't afford to screw this up, especially with the Secret held in the balance. Although, given the woman's little jib about his rights, he doubted the Secret was as intact as Beings believed it to be.

Just how much did these humans know about him? And who the hell were they? 

***

<I>Feel like you're hanging off a cliff? That's the whole point, sorry.

I'm not entirely sure when the next one will be coming, I've had a change of employment which leaves me with very little free time. Sorry for the wait, I hope you enjoyed it.

Michelle Hamund fumed in the back of the van, angry at herself for letting Susan Baryst escape, but more at the dead team in Scotland for somehow fucking this all up. 

She watched the young man sit quietly in his restraints. He exuded a strange air of power and calmness that was a bit disturbing, like this was all part of his plan somehow. Most people broke into hysterics or went into shock when arrested so violently. 

Now, as Michelle watched his calm body rocking slightly with the movements of the vehicle, she grew more concerned. The images of the UK team's bodies flashed in her mind. His apparent nonchalance disconcerted her; in her experience only the hardened criminals remained so silently stoic, not even bothering to proclaim his innocence or ask where they were going. 

The ranch kid wasn't old enough to be that hard. 

She went over her plan again, which had been forced into early action by the unexplained blunder in Scotland. She'd pulled the trigger, deciding not to give Chris and his mother the time to bolt now that they knew someone was onto them, arresting them publicly at JFK almost as soon as they'd stepped off the plane. 

His mother's escape was another huge setback; she'd somehow disappeared out of the woman's bathroom. They couldn't afford to stick around and start a fruitless search, it would only attract more attention so they'd aborted. Susan would know that he'd been arrested but what she didn't know was that there would never be a record of his arrest in any system. 

Hopefully, his disappearance would fade into the background and little resources would be devoted to a search after the initial rush to find him proved unsuccessful. Where he was going, no one could find him with either magical or conventional means. His manacles were reinforced titanium and his cell would be a two inch thick steel box, several levels underground. 

To ensure secrecy, he would need to be locked away until these Beings were revealed to the entire world, hopefully he might even prove to be a useful source of information. He would be treated firmly but well; Michelle didn't really feel animosity towards the young man himself, but rather towards what he represented. 

She held his wallet, passport, and smartphone, turning the ordinary-looking device over in her hands. It was even made by a human company, modified magically to only communicate with other like devices through some sort of encrypted wavelength they couldn't detect. The screen wouldn't even turn on for her. Amazing. 

<em>What else could these creatures do?</em> she thought. Imagine what the government could do with this kind of technology, imagine what society as a whole could do with magic. When this got out, it would be both the end of the scientific era and the beginning of a hybrid one, the best magic and science could offer, combined. 

That is, of course, if humans and Beings didn't wipe each other out in the process. 

Feeling talkative, Michelle decided to try building some rapport with the Being. They were going to get to know each other well over the coming months, years even. 

"Christopher, my name is Michelle and I'll be your primary handler. I have a lot of questions for you and you probably have some of your own but they're going to have to wait due to our present company. No offence, boys." 

"None taken, I don't need to know. He's a terrorist," one of the commandos replied. 

"That's what you told them?" Chris accused, turning towards her voice from under his hood. 

"Well, I have to put something in the system to requisition these guys. Besides, I think terrorism is the perfect charge. Couldn't you cause mass destruction and terror among the civilian population?" 

Michelle was surprised, he seemed genuinely upset to be called a terrorist. 

"It doesn't mean I would." He would have liked to look at her during the conversation but it was impossible. 

"The jury's out on that, Christopher, especially after what happened in Scotland. I know who and what you are, keep that in mind. This isn't a mistake. Your mother may have escaped but it won't matter." 

Chris's curiosity got the better of him. "How? How do you know? And do realize how much danger you're in just by saying that to me? There's no way you're a familiar." 

He tried not to make it sound like a threat but it kind of came out that way. 

"I do and I'm not," replied Michelle seriously. "Which should indicate to you that you won't be going anywhere until this <em>entire</em> issue has been resolved. We have mechanisms in place to prevent <em>any</em> means of escape." 

Chris mulled that over in his mind, something clicked. He really must be dealing with the purely human authorities and so he considered his next words carefully. There was no way this was a coincidence; she had recognized "familiar" in the context he had meant. 

"Given what I know about my personal situation, I have to conclude that you have a source, that someone is feeding you information." 

"You don't-" Michelle started. 

"Let me finish." 

Chris raised his voice a little behind his hood, a slight echo of his power trailing into it. Michelle shivered and everyone else in the van was still. 

"I know this, and I know that this must be your first or maybe second attempt at capturing one of us. Otherwise, you would have been shut down long ago. You don't know who or what I am. Your complete lack of preparation and containment proves this. Someone told you to collect me. You're clearly intelligent and experienced but if you had the whole picture, you'd never have taken someone as high profile as myself, given recent events. You don't know what you're doing, Michelle, and therefore, you're being used by someone who does." 

There was a long pause as Michelle considered his warning. He seemed genuine, which was concerning, but she knew better than to let her subject truly rattle her on their first encounter. It didn't change the plan in the short or long term. Beings would be exposed one way or another and humans would no longer be oblivious. 

"You seem very confident, time will tell," she said. 

"I doubt I'll have much time with you Michelle and I doubt even less that you'll remember it. I'm sorry." 

He sounded genuinely apologetic, and Michelle's countenance turned instantly stormy at his thinly veiled threat. She glared at him in silence. That was one of the worst things, that these Beings wielded the terrible power to take memories and alter people's minds. No one should be able to do that. 

*** 

Hours later, Chris could tell they had arrived at their destination. 

The surface of the road changed, then a little bump, and a downwards slope. They were in an enclosed space now, underground by the echo as they unloaded him very carefully and doors were slammed. He was handed off to another team of guards and the tactical team was thanked for their effort before being dismissed. 

At this stage he went along quietly, chains clicking, as Michelle guided him into what he assumed was an elevator. Sight being one of his weakest senses in his human form, he relied on the sounds and smells around him and discovered that it came quite naturally. Her hand felt hot and tense on his forearm. He could sense from her strong aura that she was concerned but determined. 

They went up what must have been fifteen or twenty stories before he was put in an artificially quiet room and bolted to the floor and table when he sat on a plastic chair. After a few moments however, he realized that the room was actually very noisy, his ears picking up whatever they were using as noise cancellation. 

His dragon enforced his calm but there was a moment where he almost panicked as someone clipped a steel band around his neck below the hood. It made a little beep as it locked into place. 

"That's a tiny explosive, rigged to detonate if you step outside of the building or if it's tampered with. Don't try anything. Your magic won't work here either." 

"That's a bit harsh," Chris muttered, shuddering from both the feel of the cold metal and the imagined effect a detonation would cause. 

"It's just a precaution. If you don't escape or try to break it, it can't hurt you." 

He was silent and still long enough that she turned to leave the room and prepare for his initial interrogation. 

Her claim of his magic not working was a bit more worrying but as he sent his senses out, his dragon detected no traces of such anti-magic anywhere. He wondered how he might test it without drawing attention. 

A tiny purple flame sprung alive unbidden in the cavity of his mouth. It tickled and warmed his pallet without burning. Chris smiled behind his hood after making sure the flame was extinguished. He still had his magic, and his captors were woefully misinformed about their magic dampening capability. 

"Michelle," Chris called, just catching her before she opened the door. "When you come back, bring face masks or something to block your sense of smell for whoever questions me... it's just a precaution." 

Getting her or anyone else dragonstruck would only make things worse, and at this point he was here to figure out what was going on and how much they knew about Beings. That was probably more important than escape. 

The door closed without a reply and even he couldn't hear the conversation that went on outside; the soundproofing was good, as one would expect. 

"What was that about?" Nathan asked in the observation room. The peppered man looked up from the screen he'd been leaning over to type on. Everything seemed to be recording smoothly across the board. 

"I don't know, do we do it? And what kind of mask?" 

Michelle was trying to feel confident but this... this teenager kept throwing curve balls at her. Something was wrong; her instincts were ringing every alarm bell she had and she was having trouble quieting them. 

"Damn it, Nathan, did we move too soon on this? We don't even know what he is, the team in the UK got destroyed. He could be powerful. And how did his mother get away? I saw her go into the bathroom myself." 

"Calm down, Michelle, he's trying to fluster you and it seems to be working. I'll go dig up some dust masks and crack open one of the biological kits for a filter mask, too. I can do the questioning if you like." 

"No. No, I got it, but thanks." 

He gave her a reassuring touch on the shoulder and headed back through the security checkpoint, down the hall to one of the equipment lockups. 

The NSA had bought this low rise office building in Harrisburg cheaply, converting it into a server farm with the top floor used as a field station and monitoring outpost with living facilities. Unusual for a building like this, it had two sublevels underneath the car park that had recently been upgraded to house holding cells. It was a discrete, secure location staffed by twenty or so people, the headquarters for field operation of their anti-Being taskforce on the East Coast. 

Meanwhile, Michelle watched Christopher through the one-way glass and on the screens displaying every angle of the room covered by cameras. Everything their captive did was being recorded in high definition from multiple angles and even infrared.  

If his claims weren't enough to unnerve her, the screen indicated that he ran at least a degree warmer than a human should, and she doubted he had a fever. Forcing herself to ignore her uneasiness, she took a deep breath and decided to have some lunch and relieve herself after their long drive. 

A few hours later after filing a report on the operation so far, having a short cat-nap, and rehearsing her plan again, she went to find Nathan, ready to start the interrogation. Michelle wasn't particularly hopeful; they'd tried talking to the captured werewolf but he'd been tight-lipped and she wasn't qualified or willing to torture him. Torture had actually been a recent subject of debate among the taskforce but it was decided that it set a precedent which would only breed further animosity. 

Once Nathan was set up behind the one way window, Michelle entered the room with two bottles of water, some snacks, and the masks. 

"I was beginning to think you would make me 'consider my situation' all day, Michelle." 

Chris was relieved to get underway, boredom and his dragon's eagerness to turn the tables on his captors over the last few hours had him feeling safe in his situation for the moment. It was time to extract his own information. 

"Sorry, Christopher, I had to set everything up for this. I brought you some snacks and a drink, though." 

"Just Chris is fine," he said warmly. There was no need to be unfriendly... well, perhaps there was, she had arrested him at gunpoint. But if anything, that almost endeared her to the dragon, who could admire her courage even if it was misplaced. 

"Thank you, Chris. Now, why do I need a mask and what kind should I use? I hope this isn't some sort of joke," Michelle warned. 

"It's no joke, I'll explain. Could you please take this hood off?" 

Michelle was going to take it off and let him drink soon anyway so she came around the desk and undid the Velcro around his neck. Chris blinked for a few seconds and looked up to assess her. 

Pretty but somewhat plain, Michelle wouldn't jump out at you in a crowd, which given her occupation was a good thing. She wore thin glasses and had her black hair short, around her ears and neck. Her body appeared to be thin and athletic beneath her jeans and black blouse. She was quite tall, probably just below six feet. Her eyes were intent and brown, studying him in return. 

Chris's eyes dropped to her thin lips, then lower again to the firm, smallish breasts before roving the rest of her body. He suspected she had some sort of southern European ancestry, given her olive complexion and thin, tall structure. Perhaps some Italian or Portuguese heritage. 

Michelle watched as he sized her up, felt his blue eyes on her face and body, watching them wandering. She was used to this kind of assessment from men, both those she worked with and those she worked to catch. She'd already had time to study his tall, well-built body so with his hood off, she focused on his face. He was blond, naturally pale but sporting a worker's tan. The eyes roving her had a happy sparkle she wasn't used to seeing across the table. His jaw was well set and he had nice lines to his face, having lost almost all boyishness. 

With his height and broad shoulders, she thought he looked a little like some sort of wild Viking. Yes, he had an air of ...something. It only backed up her intuition, something powerful and savage lurked inside this boy, if he could really be called that. 

"I think the cleaning mask should be okay. Although your man in the other room should turn up the extractor fans in here just to be sure. I don't think it would be very practical for you to question me in that," Chris pointed at the gasmask. 

Michelle looked thankfully back over her shoulder towards the control room as the air pressure changed slightly. 

"Now, here's what I propose," he continued. "You obviously work for the government in some capacity, but you're not a familiar. Yet you're in contact with one of us. You're probably a small splinter group that's been lead to believe you're helping people. I don't know why but it doesn't matter. You want to know about Beings and I want to know how much you know about Beings, so here it is. I'll answer your questions honestly if I can, but you need to answer some of mine as well. Also, you drop whatever plans you have for my family while I'm in your custody. Oh, and this is all under the caveat that if I ever get out of here, I'll hunt everyone down and have all this knowledge removed from your memory." 

Michelle cocked her had at him; just who exactly was he to be striking deals? For a moment she was tempted to walk out and let him stew for a few hours, evaporate some of that cockiness. However, the opportunity for recourse between them was too great to pass up. Besides, his threats didn't change anything. He wasn't getting out of their custody any time soon. What was she supposed to do, reject freely given information? 

"I can agree to that, although I probably won't answer your most important questions," she replied, pulling the dust mask over her nose and mouth, her voice becoming slightly muffled. "So, why do I need to wear this?" 

"Starting with the little things, hm? I like it," Chris chuckled, settling into his seat and opening one of the small packets of peanuts. 

They were awkward to eat in his restraints but he could manage if he moved his head down to his hands. He munched a salty mouthful thinking how to best explain. 

"I have pheromones which can make some people very... how do I say this... amorous? If you got a good enough exposure and already found me attractive, you'd probably throw yourself at me." 

Michelle snorted in blatant disbelief but he only smiled wryly before feeding himself some more. It was too far fetched, even for Beings; although, she had noticed that he did smell nice when she'd been leading him into the facility. She'd automatically assumed it was some scent he wore. 

"Pheromones. Like moths? Like those date rape perfumes you hear about?" 

"Hey, I'm not a rapist, I've got a girlfriend... well, I guess you could say she's my fiancé." Chris smiled to himself. He couldn't wait to get home and see Annabel. "She proposed to me on the phone last night. Can you believe it? I know I couldn't, I think it's mostly to keep her parents happy though. We're already going to be together for the rest of her life... Anyway, sorry about getting distracted. My pheromones are a pain in the ass so far. Ruins any chance of regular interactions from what I've seen." 

"Congratulations. I'm sorry to break you two apart but I'm sure you can understand our position. Now, about your pheromones, how do they work? Do they effect both sexes?" Michelle felt a little guilt about breaking the young couple apart, but he was a Being. There was every possibility that he'd used his powers to gain her interest in the first place. Especially if he was serious about the pheromones. 

"Oh, I think I'll be reunited soon enough," Chris smiled cockily and watched his interrogator scowl. "Well, the way I understand it, the pheromones amplify feelings and attractions. They can embolden a woman to approach me and even make her need me desperately if she really liked me to start with. I don't know if they work on men, I haven't had an opportunity to find out and don't really want to. I'm very new at all this, technically I wasn't even a proper Being until about a week ago. There was an enchantment that kept me as a human but it was released. That's how I know you're being set up, only another Being would know I even existed, let alone choose me as a kidnapping target. I'm highly valuable you see, an endangered species." 

If he wasn't lying, Michelle wondered why she hadn't succumbed to his influence. Objectively he was physically attractive, he was young but still very masculine and somehow self-assured. He was a Being, though, a suspect. Maybe it was just too big a mental block. 

"Well, if that's all true, I'll admit I'm a little concerned. I will look into your claims once we're finished for the day, okay? Now, will you tell me what kind of Being you are?"

--------------------------------------------
"That you don't know... there's no way your source doesn't know who I am, why would they identify me to you if they didn't? This is fucked up. Hey, don't I get to ask a question first? Who do you work for, what branch of the government?" 

"I'm a field agent for the NSA," she answered with a sigh as the cogs of her mind whirred. His argument about their information was starting to sound disturbingly logical, she couldn't believe they hadn't considered this possibility fully. They'd been too caught up in unravelling this great secret to stop and consider why they were being let in on it. 

"A real life intelligence operative? No way," Chris enthused. He'd always been into spy thrillers. 

"Way," she deadpanned. "But it's in no way glamorous." 

"You're hunting down Beings, I'd say that's at least a little glamorous, thrilling certainly." 

She only shrugged. 

"Wait, wait," Chris continued. "I've been wanting to use this joke for months. What do you think about the next-gen gaming consoles?" 

"Oh, we're right <em>onboard</em>." She bobbed her eyebrows, sending him into a fit of throaty chuckles. She even found herself joining in briefly before getting back on task. He seemed like a nice kid, perhaps the friendly tact was working. "I didn't expect humor from you, Chris, it's nice. To be honest, I didn't expect you to be willing to talk at all. You've raised some valid issues surrounding our intelligence on you, but ultimately you're in our custody. Perhaps you're overconfident, perhaps you're bluffing. Now, out with it, Chris, what species are you?" 

"I'm a dragon," Chris's said seriously, reading her brown eyes as they widened in shock before a frown broke out across her forehead and her nostrils flared very slightly. She didn't say anything so he cheekily added a little jib. "Am I still being overconfident?" 

"No, but how do I know you're telling the truth?" whispered Michelle, standing up suddenly and retreating a few steps towards the door. "Are you even secure in those cuffs?" 

"These?" Chris rattled his chains dramatically. "For the moment, I guess. However, I don't think you'd be comfortable with a demonstration of my abilities right now." 

He downplayed his ability to escape, didn't want her freaking out and shooting him or blowing up his collar just to make sure he wasn't going to get away. Michelle returned to the desk but didn't sit down, instead pacing back and forth behind it. 

"I'm not sure I believe you, Chris, it's quite outlandish. You say there's no way our source wouldn't know who and what you are?" 

"Exactly, I was completely unknown until about a week ago. Now I'm apparently the big news of the day. You see dragons are rare; I'm the seventh male alive currently, it's impossible my abduction would go unnoticed. It will spark a manhunt, both from our authorities and people wishing to capture me for their own purposes. Other beings you probably aren't prepared to counter." 

Michelle didn't want to, but she had to at least consider the consequences if his claims were true. 

"Shit. Nathan, did you get that? Get on the phone and start organizing a new location, we should move him again." 

Chris's body language and facial expression as they talked raised her hackles; he didn't seem nervous or jittery like she was, he was probably telling the truth or an expert liar. The latter was hard to believe in one so young. In the adjoining room, Nathan called their boss, setting in motion a cascade that would soon have some of the most powerful people around the world huddling in situation rooms. 

"It won't make any difference," Chris said. "My bodyguard knows what you look like and has your scent. Once my mother is safe, she'll start tracking me down with the help of a very powerful elf." 

"You don't have a bodyguard, it was only you and your mother on that plane." 

"I'm afraid not. Lillian is a vampire so you can't see her during the day," explained Chris. 

"Oh? Can all vampires do this?" 

This was actually a very useful piece of information for them, very convenient for his story about a bodyguard though. 

"Some. I think it's my turn again. Why did your team attack us in Scotland and how do you have Beings working with you?" 

"They didn't attack you, they were watching you. Don't try that bullshit with me, you must have figured out they were following you and killed them." 

Her anger over the incident flowed and Chris reeled back at the obvious disgust on her face. The incongruence confused him for just a moment. 

"Michelle, I'm sorry but they tried to run us off the road. I acted to defend myself as well as Susan and Lillian. Your men shot at us and the two Beings had equipment used to kill vampires. They knew about my bodyguard and tried to capture me for whoever they work for, which by the way, isn't you." 

"You killed them." Her tone was icy. 

"Yes," he answered. "I wasn't about to let them abduct me." 

"How? It looked like some sort of antipersonnel explosion but there wasn't any shrapnel." 

"I created a magical explosive. I also... snapped the wizard's neck," he replied quietly. The brief flashes of dragon-enraged memory sobered him deeply. 

She quivered almost unperceptively before regaining her composure; the wizard's neck had indeed been broken. 

"That's your version of events, I'll put my own together as I get a clearer picture over the next few days. I doubt you'll be charged with their deaths given your situation; I don't think we'll release you any time soon." 

Michelle's voice was steely but her composure a hair's breadth away from fracturing. What if he was telling the truth? What if the men in Scotland had actually attacked first? 

Lines of thought zipped through her overactive mind as she watched him for several seconds until a final thought locked into place: he wasn't their captive, he was sitting there with her of his own free will. Feeding her information because he knew it didn't matter. A dragon, cornered in the room with her, woefully under-restrained. 

She didn't know what to do as unease built inside her, so she kept up her questions, starting to feel clammy all over her body. 

"Twice now you've mentioned that people want to capture you. Why is that?" 

"Well, I'm a dragon. We have a direct link to the energy of whatever aspect we control... basically, we have a lot of magical power and other Beings want to use us or harvest our energy for their own magic or sustenance. Over the past centuries, we've been hunted to the verge of extinction because of it. Only relatively recently, it became illegal to hunt dragons. The survivors are protected and looked after in the hope to rebuild the species." 

Chris didn't see the harm in explaining things to her; it was unfortunate but her fate was sealed as soon as she knew Beings existed. 

"Shit," Michelle murmured while cursing internally. They were humped if that was true. They didn't even know anything about dragons other than that Radek had placed them right near the top with the other rare and powerful creatures. "So what class are you then? Four, Three? ...Two?" 

"One," he said with a smile and an apologetic shrug. 

It all made sense now; his over-easy arrest, his calm confidence. He'd let himself be captured and was just playing with her now. 

"Radek," she muttered hatefully, accepting that the wizard must have known who and what Chris was. There was little point fighting now, her memories would be taken if she wasn't outright killed... "So why haven't you killed me yet, Chris?" 

Chris saw defeat in her eyes, so haughty and piercing barely minutes ago. Finally accepting that she'd been manipulated into this situation, she flopped back into the cheap lawn chair opposite the dragon. 

"Don't give up so easily, Michelle, I don't want to kill you or anyone else. I admit, you'll need to get your memory erased but I wouldn't kill you outside of self-defence. Besides, I'll need your help to stop whoever started this nonsense in the first place and make sure we track down all traces of our existence. Is that who Radek is? Your source?" 

"Yes," Michelle confirmed before railing at her weakness. "You might be right, perhaps we were manipulated into this confrontation but whatever you do to me, you can't stop it now." Her eyes flashed angrily towards him as her back straightened and her pointed finder impacted the plastic table in frustration. "What gives you the right to keep such a huge secret? Don't you care that you treat humans like cattle?!" 

His cuffed hands opened, turning automatically towards her in a gesture of supplication. 

"Of course I care, I'm not exactly happy about the way some Beings treat humans. But that's the way it's been for millennia. Do you really think we could co-exist peacefully? It's been kept a secret for a reason, what would happen if the military found out about us?" 

Chris tried to reason, surely she could understand that the majority of humans would take affront to their very existence. However, a triumphant twinkle in her eyes gave him pause, and he suddenly felt his own sense of fear and unease. 

"You told them?" Chris was incredulous. 

"Like I said, you can't stop it now. We have safeguards." She savored the shock on his face, the way he instantly deflated, more like she was used to seeing people across the table from her. 

"Oh my God, those men I killed were actually British agents. You told other countries?!" Chris couldn't believe his own spoken thoughts. How the fuck had it gotten this far? He didn't even know what the Being response would be, what the Synod would do, but it couldn't be good. 

"Not so confident now?" Michelle gloated in her little victory. "It's going to come out no matter what you do to me, it won't make a difference in the long run." 

"I'm not going to <em>do</em> anything to you, Michelle! Jesus, what kind of secret agency are you? Do you even...? How many people know about us? Damn it, who else did you tell, are you trying to start a war?" 

"It doesn't have to end like that, we've talked about peaceful resolutions. We have a right to know, Chris," Michelle reasoned, seeing how distressed he was at the thought of a global revelation, beginning to struggle against his restraints. 

It was true. Ultimately, a peaceful co-existence was the only option which wouldn't result in massive loss of life on both sides. Beings had apparently been entrenched in humanity's existence for millenia, they couldn't just be picked off like fleas, though some would no doubt think that they could. The leaders of the informed countries realised this but agreed the Secret couldn't be allowed to remain, it was just too big. 

"How else do you think it will end, huh?" Chris said. "How are you going to get all the countries in the world to agree to peace, let alone all the Beings? There would be panic and chaos everywhere. People would kill their own neighbors for sleeping in too late in case they were a vampire!" 

He needed to leave; he had to get out of here right now and warn someone. The time for discretion was past. How had the humans even managed to raise this much awareness? Was the Synod that ineffectual? 

Michelle was about to respond when a claxon started blaring throughout the building. 

"We're under attack, the elevator guards are down and they're coming up the stairs!" Nathan's voice sounded through the intercom. 

Around the building, prayers were murmured and guns were drawn. Michelle stood, surprised at her calmness, perhaps resignation. She walked around the desk to Chris, who reared away as much as his chains would allow. 

"Hold still, I'm taking the collar off. There's no point in you getting your head blown off. Your people move quickly, I guess what you said about being important was true." 

Chris held still, hoping she wasn't about to blow them both up. They paused as the collar come off with another little beep, in the second afterwards they barely heard a muffled scream followed by gunshots. 

"I guess they're not interested in rehabilitation. Well, it was certainly interesting to meet you, Chris." 

She started for the door. 

"Where are you going?" Chris asked, confused; she was headed into the pointless fight. 

"If it's all the same to you, I'll go down fighting rather than let someone rummage around in my head." 

"It's not," he replied. His rapid transformation already starting. 

Michelle watched in awe as purple spread quickly across his skin, back bulging under his shirt until huge wings burst outwards. His nose flattened, and his face became slightly leaner as the deep, regal color spread up across his hair. He opened his eyes and she saw his reptilian, vertical pupils, absolutely black but rimmed with a thin edge of gold, transitioning into the lighter, slightly mottled purple of the rest of his visible eyeball. It was a shocking demonstration of just how inhuman he really was. A real-life dragon. 

The battle raging throughout the rest of the building was momentarily forgotten as a searing light in his hands burned through his restraints and forced her to look away, shielding her eyes with her forearm. When she lowered her arm, he was towering over her, barely a foot away. 

"I'm not going to let you commit suicide out there." 

"How did... don't try to stop me." 

Michelle turned and took a powerful step towards the door before a huge, taloned hand gripped her arm. With an angry hiss she spun and delivered her best punch right into his gut. He made only a little huff as her fist collided with a very hard, toned front. Put off by his indifference, she made to hit him again but he wrapped his steely arms around her much smaller frame. In seconds, he had her back pressed to his chest with her arms pinned up at her breasts. She tried to head-butt his nose but just hit his shoulder. 

"Get the fuck off me!" she screamed in frustration, struggling helplessly in his inhumanly strong grip, lashing out with her legs, her glasses clattering to the floor. 

"Calm down, Michelle, I'm not going to hurt you." 

His deep voice rang powerfully in her ear; she stopped struggling for a moment, panting through her face mask which was partially dislodged but still smothering and uncomfortable. 

"And why not?" asked a smug male voice as the door opened. "It would be perfect. I expected you break your chains almost immediately but you took too long. I just couldn't wait." 

Chris and Michelle looked up simultaneously, instantly stilling their tussle as the newcomer entered the room. The dragon tensed, squeezing the agent tightly to his chest as he sensed the powerful Being. His presence was dark, full of writhing motion and hatred; it almost gave Chris a sense of nausea but he had no idea who or what the short, greying, middle-aged man in the cheap suit was. 

"Who are you?" Chris snarled, his fangs flashing as his dragon prepared for a hard fight. 

This Being wasn't part of a rescue team. His stature was unthreatening but everything about him felt wrong and evil to his dragon's senses. He even smelled off, a cloying, dank sweetness that brought images of creeping mold into Chris's mind. There was also the scent of fresh blood seeping into the air from the control room. 

"Oh, my manners," he tittered with a dramatic flourish of his hands. "I'm Radek, I coordinated our little gathering. It's nice to meet you, Christopher, you are indeed magnificent." 

"Radek! You set this up, you piece of shit!" Michelle's shock had worn off and she screamed her betrayal at him, wriggling again to get free of the dragon. 

"Yes," Radek said gleefully. "And what a setup it is! You capture this wonderful specimen for me, my minions tear your men to shreds, and the humans think he's responsible. Meanwhile, I harvest the essence of a powerful dragon, an excellent conduit, and dump his mangled corpse somewhere for the Synod to find. Before you know it, humans and Beings will be at each other's throats. I'll admit, it wasn't all according to the plan, but let it never be said that I don't take advantage of a situation when..." 

"Nice monologue," Chris smiled toothily. 

Shifting instantly into the Ether, he dragged Michelle forcefully with him as he faded. Radek let out a furious, inhuman shriek and loosed a ball of dark red, pulsing energy towards them with a lunge. 

It was too late. 

Michelle's body shuddered as she entered the Ether, and Chris felt his dragon somehow extending around her, shielding her from the drain which would have killed her in seconds otherwise. Already he was running, picking her up under the knees as they phased straight through ghostly walls and furniture in the dim light. He had to put some effort into breaking the resistance but it was next to nothing in his adrenaline-fuelled state. 

Michelle couldn't make a sound; she wrapped her arms up around his neck and turned to watch them pass through concrete, wood, and steel in disbelief. Each new obstacle made her wince her eyes shut, expecting an impact, before feeling only subtle pressure as his jarring footfalls propelled them right through. 

She couldn't begin to comprehend the dark, shadowy, purple and grey realm of the Ether. Her mind had been shocked into passive observation as they brushed through the external wall and out into open space. 

They only plummeted briefly before she felt the tug of gravity in her stomach. It seemed odd that gravity should still exist when she'd just watched them run through solid walls. They weren't falling anymore though, the colorless street passing quickly below them. Michelle looked up across his fluttering shirt, his skin glowed faintly and his muscles heaved as his wings beat powerfully. 

Neither Chris nor his dragon felt any sense of shame about running; they'd out-maneuvred Radek as he got caught up in his victory. Besides, he was obviously powerful, unknown, and had an intricate plan in motion. By the sounds of it, he'd wanted to start a war between humans and Beings. 

Now the only real proof that Chris hadn't slaughtered everyone in the building was gripped tightly in his arms as they flew out across the city. 

Flying. He was flying! New muscles worked on instinct to propel him above the streets, cars, and people below. He took a few seconds to revel in the amazing feeling before he brought his mind figuratively back down to earth, promising himself to take Annabel flying with him in the future. 

The dragon didn't sense any pursuers, they'd escaped. Now Chris realized that his next priority was to get back to safety and warn everyone. Reyla would know what to do but she was so far away and he had no idea how to find any local Being authority. 

An idea popped into his mind, one he'd only thought about last night as he and Susan had talked about finding somewhere to live. Was it even possible? The fact that Michelle was in the Ether and still alive, if shocked into a stupor, indicated that it was. . . 

Calling on his dragon, Chris pulled energy from the aspect around him, his vision distorting and shimmering as the Ether rippled and he gathered as much as he thought he could safely hold. The power writhed across his skin after a few moments, building and building. He felt his ears equalizing as pressure build, so much so that he had trouble maintaining his flapping wings and began gliding downwards, devoting his mind to his intended destination. 

Having an image of Reyla's courtroom in his mind's eye, he pictured himself standing there, holding Michelle in his arms. He released the magic all at once, felt it crashing up his nerves towards the image in his brain, setting his body on fire briefly before suddenly, there was nothing. 

He ceased to exist. 

*** 

Radek cursed as he felt the dragon's presence suddenly vanish with a pop. He wasn't stupid enough to follow the lad into his own aspect in his current, weakened state. He'd underestimated the young dragon for the last time, first with the team he'd sent to capture him in Scotland, and again by gloating when he should have been killing. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
It was in his nature though, to scheme, plot, and sow discord; his guilty pleasure was to enjoy his victim's distress. Unfortunately it sometimes mussed his plans. 

Perhaps he should have given the humans real magic dampening charms instead of artistic, worthless trinkets. 

"No matter," he sighed to himself, straightening his ruffled suit and stepping back into the observation room over the dead body of one of the humans. The building was quiet now, his minions having completed their gruesome job perfectly. 

The dragon didn't even matter, really, a small sideshow of his own greediness. A patsy of opportunity who might have been a very tasty morsel. There were others who could fill his shoes. 

It was time to stir up human outrage and watch the world fall into chaos. In a few short months, the universe would align for him to complete his mission. With luck, any Beings with half a chance of stopping him would be dead or in hiding by then. 

He would come back for the dragon, though; perhaps it would be more fun this way. Yes, his escape would only make the hunting more enjoyable, the taste of his soul more delectable. 

Reaching into his pocket, Radek fished out a flash drive and plugged it into the machine in the observation room. Humans had truly come so far in the past century, he marvelled at their technology, beginning to rival the power of magic... it was perfect. He copied what he needed, wiped everything else. Placing his hand on the computer, he sent a bolt of corruption through the network. The humans would never know what really happened here, but assume their plot had been discovered by vengeful Beings. 

Soon enough they would strike first, fearing losing the initiative. They would hit hard, with as much power as they could to throw the Beings into disarray. At least that was the plan, his plan. 

He always had a plan. 

*** 

Chris felt a few seconds of disconcerting, bodiless nothingness as they sped through the Ether at nigh unimaginable speeds. 

Their trip didn't end as smoothly as he'd envisioned. Instead of standing in the courtroom, he found himself rocketing into the Norm up near the ceiling, real air buffeting his wings. There was a scream from below as he plunged uncontrollably across the huge chamber; streaking low across the rows of seats, he quickly realized he was going to crash. 

With a final flap, he twisted onto his back in mid-air, folding his wings in and tucking his chin down into Michelle's chest, he hurtled onto the marble floor with a crunch and skidded along his reinforced, scaly spine, narrowly avoiding a pew. 

He ended up bowling into the small group of startled Beings at the center of the room, knocking them flying like so many pins, their legs slowing him a little until he came to an abrupt stop against the bottom step of Reyla's throne's alter. The back of his head hit the step and he was knocked out instantly. 

Michelle, dazed but ultimately unhurt, heard the commotion around her, shouting and cursing as people picked themselves back up or moved to see if the dragon was okay. She didn't have her glasses, and panicked slightly. She could still see okayish at short distances, but she had deep fears about being lost, trapped, or attacked without her glasses while she couldn't see well. 

First to reach the scene was a huge, very angry woman. Michelle was unceremoniously dragged up by the scruff of her neck, the taller, voluptuous beauty sneering viciously as her black, knife-like claws dug into Michelle's soft skin and held her in place. Stoically, Michelle only let out a tiny, involuntary whimper. 

"This is the human who arrested him," Lillian spat, her fangs flashing dangerously as blood trickled down and began seeping into Michelle's t-shirt. 

"Really?" Reyla asked, still disbelieving. She'd found Lillian's account of events astonishing. 

Annabel meanwhile rushed over and didn't stop shaking the dragon until he responded several second later with a groan and a weak push to make her stop. Unperturbed, she flung her arms around him, draping herself across his chest. 

"Babe, I was so worried," she cried directly in his ear. 

"It's okay, Dee. I'll be fine," Chris managed, lifting his hands to wrap up around her lower back and hug her. "I missed you." He kissed the side of her head, taking a deep breath of her comforting, familiar smell. 

"What happened?" Susan asked form behind them. "How did you get here?" 

Chris pushed them up into a sitting position, almost losing consciousness again to the sense of vertigo. Reaching around to feel the painful bump at the back of his head, he was just happy he hadn't busted his scull wide open. He felt very dizzy and his vision was unfocused. 

"He teleported," Reyla answered for him, impressed that he'd managed to pull it off without any training. He could certainly be forgiven his hard arrival. 

"Reyla," Chris twisted to look up at the drow, "do you have some way to contact the Synod? I need to talk to them right now." 

"Why, Chris? We need to figure out where you were and organize with the local Beings to get this mess cleaned up. We have to protect the Secret." 

"The Secret is done, Reyla, it's gone." He collapsed back onto the floor and stared up at the ceiling as his words sunk into everyone present. 

*** 

The next minutes were a confused bustle as Reyla made phone calls and ordered an emergency teleconference between the thirteen Synod members and whichever territorial leaders could be contacted on such short notice. There was an atmosphere of shocked disbelief among Reyla's staff as Tosh and several others battled to set up large screens and the cameras which would transmit via Maginet. Most others hovered, lending a hand if they could but waiting to hear the dragon's full story. 

Susan and Annabel fussed over Chris, sneaking reassuring, tender kisses with the groggy dragon while he was too befuddled and sore to resist them. However, he was quickly regaining his strength and soon noticed the absence of his human witness. 

"Don't get up, Chris, that was a nasty knock on the head," Susan protested as he made to stand. 

"I'll be fine, Mom, where's Michelle?" 

"Who?" 

Michelle was easy to spot once he was up, wincing as Lillian held her immobile by the neck, a threat of death if she attempted to move. 

"Jesus, Lillian, let her go. She's bleeding." 

Chris started over towards her, quickly closing the gap and becoming angry as he saw how large the stain on Michelle's black shirt had spread. 

Lillian didn't move; she was furious. This was the human who'd arrested him. She was probably involved in the attack in Scotland as well. Deep inside, so deep Lillian didn't recognise it consciously, her vampire raged that she and Chris had been separated, his supposedly hated scent no longer teasing her nostrils. She would take her revenge on this woman for stealing what was hers. 

Lillian's irises were dark and her eyes heavily shadowed, her bountiful chest rose and fell heavily with excitement, breaths she didn't really need to take while her fangs extended down into her plush bottom lip. Chris could tell he was dealing with the vampire not the woman, as likely to kill Michelle as to release her. 

Her black clawed finger suddenly twitched on Michelle's neck and Chris's purple hand blurred around Lillian's milky throat. 

"I said release her!" bellowed the dragon in her face, his talons curling into such a vice-like grip that the vampire was forced to checked herself. 

"Fine," she hissed, dropping the human abruptly and wrenching herself from his grasp, tearing her skin on his talons on purpose. Michelle would have fallen to the floor but Chris's hand was already there to steady her as the vampire sped off. 

Lillian slunk to her favorite lurking spot, the shadows behind the third column along the west side of the hall. She was very confused, felt betrayed he'd treated her like that when she was only seeking revenge on his behalf. Yet at the same time, the brutal strength she'd felt and the sting of shallow, healing wounds on her neck spoke to the most base, violent parts of her nature, the parts she herself disliked the most. As she calmed, Lillian grasped just how close to the edge she'd been since that morning at the airport when he'd been hauled off. It scared her how much influence he already seemed to have over her. 

"Sorry about that, Michelle," Chris apologized. "Let me see your neck. Ouch. That was my bodyguard, Lillian. You'll have to forgive her, I think she must be quite upset you arrested me." 

Michelle's neck was throbbing and bruised, still trickling blood from the five claw marks. "Tough shit," she croaked, muscles aching as she spoke. "What's your plan now anyway? Going to gloat that you were right?" 

"Maybe later, first I'm going to heal you." 

Chris leaned in and had his tongue on her neck before she could protest. She struggled against his arm cradling her in such an intimate pose for a moment but ended up letting out a little moan as his saliva cooled and healed her skin. She actually offered the other side of her throat to him of her own accord, reaching up to feel the unmarred skin on the side where he'd just finished. 

Her blood was fresh and clean, and his dragon definitely enjoyed her taste and smell as he finished up. It kind of disturbed Chris; he hadn't really thought about it, but now he'd lapped up a stranger's blood and found it quite tasty. 

Michelle didn't care how strange or intimate it might seem anymore. The relief was exquisite and she marvelled at her own first-hand experience with magic. 

"You healed me? Just like that? What else can you do? How did we get here... we went right through walls! Where are we?!" 

It all flooded out as he pulled away and held her by the shoulders. 

"We were in a place called the Ether, I'll explain it later but now we're in Denver." 

Chris was relieved she was okay, that she seemed to be recovering and wasn't too shaken from her run in with Lillian. He'd been acting on instinct when they'd jaunted through the Ether, only guessing and hoping that she would survive the experience with his help. 

"Alright come over here and meet my mother, try not to arrest her this time. Susan, Annabel, this is Michelle. She works for the NSA." 

"Hello," Annabel said, making it sound quite unfriendly. Watching him nuzzle her neck hadn't exactly ingratiated Michelle to her, that and the way he still had a hand on her back. 

"Hello, Michelle," Susan said more warmly. "I'm not his biological mother, by the way... I'm a witch not a dragon. Good thinking, Chris, but she could take that mask off, I'll make more neutralizing potion if I have to." 

Susan couldn't help but grin; it wouldn't be a chore at all. 

"Yes, hello, it's nice to ah... meet you in person." Michelle awkwardly removed the crumpled, slightly bloody dust mask and inhaled cool, fresh air again. Finally. 

"What happened, Chris?" Annabel asked. "Why did you bring her here?" 

"Well," Chris started, taking Annabel's hand in a warm grip. "I'm not exactly sure but it seems someone has tried to start a war between Beings and humans using me as some sort of fall guy. Human governments know about Beings, Dee. There are a lot of bodies back where we just came from. Michelle is the only person who can tell the right people that it wasn't us, that we don't want a fight." 

"A fight may be inevitable at this point, dragon," Reyla spoke up, moving her piercing gaze towards the new woman, intimidating her. "Do not attempt to resist our questioning, human. You've managed to kick a hornet's nest far greater in scope than your precious governments can comprehend. The Synod will use any means necessary to extract what we need from you." 

A chill crept up Michelle's spine as she tried to hold the impossibly beautiful dark elf's gaze. There was ancient wisdom in those haughty grey eyes. Something else too, cruelty, and the cold scaring of one who'd performed untold unspeakable acts, and would gladly perform them again. She recognized that look, she couldn't hold the contact. 

The dragon's warm, reassuring hand felt the shiver run up her back and dispelled it with a few gentle strokes as his enemy of barely a few hours ago looked up at him for support. 

"I won't let anything happen to you, Michelle, this isn't your fault. But you do need to tell us everything you know. We have to steer this away from total chaos and you're the only one who can help me do that." 

*** 

The Synod, thirteen members representing the wisdom and knowledge of most of the being races, were not impressed with Chris's story. 

First they tried to blame him for revealing himself under Michelle's questioning, stating it was irrelevant that she already knew about the existence of Beings. John Guthrie was the only friendly face, although he was very business-like given the situation. 

Eventually they grasped the idea that this character named Radek had been coaching the US government through the NSA, revealing enough for them to start following and abducting Beings, Amassing a decent amount of information, and letting the military as well as other countries in on the Secret. 

It was then that the questions got serious and the talks of damage control started. 

Michelle watched, seeing that they were mostly no different from her own leaders, scared and confused when confronted with such a huge affront to their way of life. She believed now that Radek must have planned a confrontation from the start, that he had informed the NSA just enough to make them leap into action, but at the same time, taint their view of Beings towards their worst aspects. 

They questioned Chris thoroughly about everything that had happened, especially his confrontation with Radek, whom it was agreed must never have sworn the oath to protect the Secret. If he had, such a huge breach would have been felt through the enchantment and they would have stopped him. 

That left the question of who and what he was unanswered, but it seemed to Michelle's expert eye that some of the Synod members were suspiciously tight lipped on the subject. 

Soon enough, they plonked Michelle in a stool and shoved a camera in her face to begin questioning her. She couldn't help but notice the irony of her situation. Stubborn non-cooperation would be counterproductive and ultimately futile but she was unwilling to give them everything. 

"Please, Michelle, tell them the whole thing. We need to figure this out before it gets any more out of control," Chris pleaded. 

"I can understand that, Chris, it's obvious after what Radek said, but I won't offer up names when I have no guarantee what's going to happen to them. I could be signing their death sentences." She turned back to the Synod before continuing. "Our main allies around the world know about you, and we've figured out where most of your territorial hubs are. The military has already implemented contingencies in case you attack, although I honestly don't know what they involve." 

"What do you hope to gain? What do the humans want from us?" asked a tiny woman with large dragonfly-like wings. 

"We want the truth," Michelle stated. "Your Secret is too huge to deny any longer. From what I've heard, we don't want a war, but we won't back down from a global revelation. You've mistreated humans horrifically for millennia and now that we know, it can't continue. Thankfully our leaders have recognized that it's outside of their capabilities to wipe you all out systematically without suffering horrific losses in return." 

"How long ago did this Radek contact you? How long have you known?" the fairy continued. 

"I've known for six months, most people involved have known for just over four." 

There was uproar amongst the Synod and assembled Beings. 

"What?" Michelle asked, turning to Chris, who could only shrug apologetically. 

"Memory alteration or removal becomes increasingly difficult as time progresses," Susan came to the rescue. "As the memory becomes engrained and reinforced with more thoughts, it's dangerous to change them. There would almost certainly be irreparable damage from removing memories over four months old." 

"So, you can't do it? You can't just wipe everyone's memory?" 

"It might be kinder to simply kill them," Reyla drawled; it seemed the idea was on her mind as well as several of the Synod's. 

"I won't let-" 

"This has gone on long enough," interrupted a haughty, blond elf suddenly. He'd previously had the appearance of paying little attention to the goings on. "How can we determine how to proceed if this human is holding back vital information? Lady Narlakis, enter her mind and take everything, she needs to have her memories erased or be killed eventually." 

"No! Please, Chris! Don't let them!" Michelle's dread infested her voice as she reached for the dragon's hand, clinging to it. Although she might have liked to present a stronger face to the Synod, she would rather die than have her mind destroyed. 

"No one's touching her mind," Chris growled back at the computer screens, surprising himself with the dragon's anger. "She's the only one who can convince the humans I didn't slaughter all the people back in Harrisburg while I was captive; the only one who can convince them Radek isn't their friend. What do you think they'll do when they find all those bodies? They'll assume we know, and think we're going to attack." 

"She dies or her memories are erased, that's the law," sneered the elf. "Either way, we need whatever secrets are locked in her little head. It's not going to matter once everyone involved with this incident has theirs wiped as well." 

A murmur of agreement went around several of the faces on the screens. John Guthrie shrugged apologetically to Chris, but there might have been a knowing twinkle in his eye. 

"Are you people stupid?" Chris asked, shocking pretty much everyone with his disrespect. "You can't wipe the memories of military and government officials around the world, especially if it's as difficult as you say after so much time. Do you think that will go unnoticed? You can't simply kill them either, and you don't know who else they've told by now." 

"Listen, boy-" 

"You listen! What about the safeguards Michelle told you about? For all you know they have missiles targeted for every territory hub in the world or evidence set to leak onto the internet if these people suddenly forget all about Beings. What about Radek, what's to stop him from telling them we're about to launch a global attack? He clearly wants a confrontation between us, he said so himself. Don't you see? He's set it up so that we can't just make this all disappear. You're all worried about maintaining the Secret, but this woman is our best chance at stopping <em>outright war!</em>" 

When he finished his rant there was silence for several moments as he glared at the obtuse elf. 

"There is another way," John Guthrie spoke, after an appropriately somber moment of acting as if was considering all the options. The young dragon had probably just made some lifelong enemies, but damn, had he put the Synod in their place. "It would satisfy our laws and allow her to keep her life and memories intact so long as she agreed to take a truth syrup and answer our questions. Then she could try to calm the situation with the humans but still be under oath not to reveal the Secret, if that even applies." 

"How?" asked Chris. 

"Why, if she agrees to become your familiar, of course." 

"Hunh," Reyla grunted, shaking her head in resignation and sending her jewelled, alabaster ponytail into disarray. "Dragons." 

*** 

Ten minutes later, Chris murmured the last of his vows, reaching out to envelope her sad, barely willing presence in whatever comfort he could offer. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
"Human, I accept you, place you under my protection. I share the Secret and mark you as one of us. Serve me well." 

Neither of them were enthused about it; an arrangement of necessity rather than out of any desire to be tied together for the rest of their lives. Still, Chris tried to give her a little of himself. It was nothing like the experience with Annabel, his heart wasn't in it. Perhaps she might have better luck or protection, something. At the least he should be able to feel where she was and sense if she was in danger. 

At the last minute, he'd put his hand over her shoulder and saved her the pain of the tattoo needle, putting his registration number on her in magic, purple digits. The dragon continued to surprise him with these displays of magic, despite their lack of training. He didn't know how he did these things, probably couldn't repeat them if he tried to; they just happened when he felt strongly about something. 

Michelle wept quietly at the loss of her freedom. She knew it wasn't his fault and could feel him trying to comfort her somehow. Ultimately, when faced with the option of servitude or the rape of her mind and death, she'd chosen servitude. 

Besides, she could tell Chris wasn't the kind of person who would take advantage of her situation. She couldn't blame him for this or the men he'd killed in Scotland; everything fell on Radek's head in her numbed mind. 

So, as he held her gently in his purple arms, she'd repeated her part of the ceremony after the midnight elf. 

"Being, I give myself freely to you, bind myself to you. I vow to serve, place you above all others, and uphold the Secret. I'm yours." 

Their situations had reversed was so rapidly; he was now her protector, her lifeline in the very world she'd been fighting against. She could feel the little tingle of magic on her shoulder. It was strange, her head cradled against his chest, their connection locked into place, her body 'clicking' somehow as he gave her his small safeguard. 

When they broke their embrace, they stared into each other's eyes for a moment before Michelle had to get up and walk away, overwhelmed by what she'd just agreed to. She was bound to a dragon for the rest of her life! 

Annabel followed, catching up and stopping her. They slumped into a nearby pew, the otherworldly lights hovering uncaringly above. 

Michelle held her head in her hands as Annabel stroked her back, all unfriendly thoughts erased from her mind as she'd helplessly watched the woman be forced into her current position. 

"It's not so bad," Annabel murmured. "There's no one better you could be bonded to. You might even come to enjoy this world eventually; I know I love it already, even if it does have ugly parts." 

Annabel couldn't help but glance over at the large screens showing the Synod, still arguing about the best course of action. 

"What am I supposed to do now?" Michelle whispered. "My whole life I've... They just... it wasn't even a real choice." 

"I know, I'm sorry," Annabel consoled. "But you seem like the kind of woman who wouldn't let that stop you. I know Chris will help you make whatever life you want for yourself but first you've got to help set things straight." 

As the younger woman's words sunk in, Michelle looked up towards the crowd, searching for him. He was easy to spot, facing away from her as he talked with his mother. His huge stature alone would have been enough if the clawed thumbs, the high points of his purple leathery wings didn't stand out a full foot above his head. 

As if sensing her gaze, he turned his attention and gave Michelle a nod and a wry smile. 

"You're right, Annabel," Michelle lowered her head from view and smiled weakly. "I don't even know you, but thanks. I can probably do a lot of good on this end." 

They sat in consolatory silence until Chris came and got them several minutes later, the Synod was fed up with waiting. He led Michelle back to the interrogation chair whilst Reyla produced a small vial of bubbling, orange syrup. 

Michelle sniffed it. If she didn't know better she might think it was simply Fanta. 

"Promise me, Chris, you won't let them hurt anyone I name." 

"You know I can't guarantee that, Michelle, but I'll try. After today, I'm sure you'll be involved in sorting this out anyway. You can help make sure they stay safe." 

She gave him a very searching look before downing the little potion in one swallow. 

It was surprisingly viscous. She could feel it tingle her throat, instantly understanding that she would be uninhibited, speaking the truth with little control over if she answered or not. Her lucidity faded rapidly and, in a few moments, she felt absolutely drunk. 

Michelle fought desperately but felt her mind enter some sort of detached state. She looked at the concerned dragon kneeling next to her, letting out a tiny, drunken giggle at his appearance despite resisting the urge for all she was worth. It was a terrible sensation, but she watched her giggle transform into manic laughter until Chris steadied her with a gentle hand. 

The Synod grilled her for about half an hour. 

She gave up everything; the president and his key advisors, the joint chiefs, the heads and deputies of the other security agencies. Everyone in her own agency who knew of the Secret as well as those she thought might know in Australia, France, and the UK. 

She told them every Being they knew of and every place she knew they frequented; the Synod becoming more agitated with each new answer to their questions. They really didn't like it when she started naming the hub cities around the globe. 

Occasionally, a heated argument between the Beings would give her a much needed break. 

Intoxicated, her attention was drawn to her "master," whom she studied woozily; his huge stature, his multi colour skin, and his reptilian features. He even had claws and wings! He looked very enticing to her uninhibited mind. At one point she reached out to touch his delightfully smooth, tiny scales but almost fell off her stool, her balance completely failing her. 

"You're pretty drunk, huh?" Chris said as he caught her and propped her back up on her chair. 

"You're pretty... pretty," she hiccupped without even meaning to. Her detached, conscious persona screamed embarrassment but it didn't stop her lips moving. 

"Pretty?" the dragon asked, swivelling very quickly to look at her. He had a smile on his face which revealed very sharp, interlocked teeth and his canine fangs, suddenly highlighting how dangerous and inhuman he was. 

"Yeah, pretty scary, too," she continued quietly. Her inquisitive hand snuck upward to brush his thin lips but he caught it short and guided it back down to her thigh. 

"It will be over soon, Michelle." He patted her arm, keeping his hand there to steady her wobbling. This potion was truly an absolute violation. He hadn't considered how much everyone relied on inhibition to keep themselves in check. 

The questions resumed soon enough and now they asked about any revealing evidence the governments might have. She slurred her way through an explanation of the video of the werewolf transformation. There were also hours of surveillance footage they'd taken while observing Beings but it probably didn't have anything incriminating on it. 

When asked about the fail safes she'd mentioned earlier, she vehemently proclaimed, "I don't know!" 

Chris watched the Synod's faces darken even further. They'd obviously been hedging that Michelle would reveal the human's plans under the influence of the truth syrup. The humans had been careful to limit the distribution of this information for this very reason. 

She'd already told them everything she knew about Radek. That bastard deserved to rot in Hell for what he'd done and what she was now being put through because of it. As they continued to question her about him, though, her anger overflowed into loud cursing and some rather vigorous gesticulation. She couldn't stop herself, her throat becoming hoarse as she shouted out every insult she could think of at him. 

"Motherfucking shit-faced old fuck asshole!" 

The assembled Beings looked a bit taken aback at her outburst as Chris tried to soothe her. 

"Easy, Michelle, calm down. Look at me. Look at me!" He ended up trapping her arms against her sides with a bruising grip, forcing her to stop and look at him. 

She eventually stopped struggling, tears streaming down her cheeks as she finally focused on him. He released his hold and stroked softly up and down her arms. 

"I'm so sorry, Michelle." 

Her tears overflowed again and she flung herself forward into his comforting arms, his cozy scent. 

Chris rubbed her shaking back, he knew this was necessary for the synod to be satisfied but it had gone on long enough. 

Usually Michelle would have beat the shit out of anyone who dared to touch her like he was, but as she cried herself out, it strangely didn't feel wrong. It had been so long since someone expressed care about her well-being. In her delirious state, it felt good. Her mind started to focus more on that feeling, forgetting about Radek altogether. She calmed rapidly after that, staring unfocused and blurry between his wings as she automatically snuggled into his neck. 

"That's enough," she heard him state firmly. 

"You don't decide that," came the high pitch voice of the fairy. 

"She's distraught and she's told you everything she knows. You haven't managed to uncover any suggestion that she's trying to mislead you and perhaps most importantly, she's my familiar. It's enough!" 

There was silence as the Synod considered whether or not to push the issue further. They were the ultimate authority among Beings, but a Being had sovereignty over his own familiar. Precedents would be broken if they overrode that. 

No one spoke up, so Reyla handed Chris the antidote with an amused smile. 

He quickly guided the vial to Michelle's lips, a sour mixture which had her head clearing slowly as she listened to the Synod resume their bickering about what to do. 

"The only think we can do is try wiping the slate clean, eradicating the memory of everyone who might know, damage to their minds be damned," spoke the blonde elf from before. 

Chris took note of the man as someone to watch out for. <em>Snake</em>, his dragon murmured hatefully. Chris had to agree, he seemed particularly callous. How far removed from any aspect of humanity he must be to consider their lives so valueless. 

"It's too late for that, Eramir," said a pale man with a thick, European accent from behind a dark cowl. "Even if we had enough psykers to attempt simultaneous wipes worldwide. Someone would slip through the cracks even if the damage we caused miraculously went unnoticed. You elves have too much faith in your magics." 

Several others agreed, and thankfully, calmer heads prevailed, reasoning that such a blatant pattern would only arouse further suspicion and wouldn't stop any fail safes from triggering. A few talked about global preparedness to strike, spells to knock out satellites, aircraft navigation, and communications networks worldwide. 

"That won't help either," Michelle said as she found her voice. "They'll know exactly why it's happening, except the countries that don't will assume they're under attack. You'll have a global nuclear standoff until someone explains what's going on. Please, consider revealing yourselves peacefully. You could come up with a treaty, name almost any terms you wanted." 

"You humans truly wish our existence to be common knowledge? How do you expect us to live side-by-side?" asked a venerable wizard. 

"It won't be easy, sure, but it will be far better than war," Chris said. It was a scary thought, but he could already begin to see the advantages of a peaceful revelation, given the alternative. 

"It would be the opposite of what Radek has worked to achieve," added Michelle. 

Her suggestion was met with mixed reaction, and the heated debate started again. 

Finally John Guthrie, previously not very vocal, spoke up after a particularly pointless argument about more memory removal. 

"People, our path is straightforward and clear, in my mind at least. The breach is too large to stopper, humans in places of power have been aware of us for months. They cannot be wiped nor removed without committing an act of war in the eyes of the humans, who have unknown mechanisms in place to counter this very kind of action. Our only option, outside of starting a war which would likely destroy this planet, is to meet with these humans and prepare to reveal the Secret on our terms. We all knew this was a possibility and to be honest, it's a miracle they hadn't already found us on their own." 

"How do you expect us to live without the Secret?" Eramir asked petulantly. "The humans will hunt us down." 

"I don't deny it will be difficult, it might even destroy both of our society's ways of life. But we must rely on our own governorship and guide our people, having faith in human leaders to do the same. We have nothing to lose. If peace fails, we will only be sitting in this exact position again, that is to say, on the brink of a war which would end us both." 

"How are we to feed? The humans won't allow us to prey upon them any longer," the gaunt man in the cloak said. 

"Vladimir, there are enough humans to feed every vampire in the world thousands of times over. You can live off donated blood or the blood of your familiars. I know there's something in it for you to hunt and chase your prey down but we will all need to make sacrifices." 

"You won't even have to do that," Michelle piped in, a bit hesitant at first before her voice and ideas strengthened as she spoke. "There are so many freaks around these days. Hell, there are probably people who would pay to be fed on, as long as you don't kill them. You Beings have enough money and power to buy whatever you want in the human world. That's really all this will come down to, money and power. You are going to bring an entirely new resource into the open, magic. Sure, everyone is going to freak out for a few months but when the dust settles and we sort out the details, you'll be able to walk down the street in your true forms and ask whatever price you want for your services. That's just the beginning. Think about what magic and science could accomplish together. You could probably cure diseases and stop global warming." 

"I doubt it will be as simple as that, but the woman has a good point," agreed the ancient dragon. "A vote then." 

There was several more minutes of muttering but eventually, all thirteen members conceded to at least explore peaceful revelation, to contact the humans and see what they actually wanted. Besides, what other choice did they really have? 

*** 

Michelle couldn't believe she was actually doing this, acting as go-between in what was likely to be the most revolutionary first contact in recorded history. 

The Synod told her very specifically that she wasn't allowed to reveal any tactically significant information but that had slipped right through the cracks, she was so nervous. Barely five hours ago, she had been questioning Chris. Now so much had happened, and most of it was based off information she'd given the Synod. If it all went wrong, would it be her fault? 

She spoke her identification code into the phone, as well as a codeword which indicated the supernatural nature of call's subject. She didn't even have to wait ten seconds. 

"Michelle, thank God! We've been in a situation room for the last two hours, since you missed your contact time. What the Hell is going on? The feed from the Harrisburg facility came back up a couple hours ago. No one can find Director Neelson and the generals are talking about first strike capabilities like it's our only option." 

"Calm down, Mr. President, and I suggest you stop talking for a moment. I'm as compromised is it gets, there are Beings listening to this conversation," Michelle replied. 

"Shit!" the President exclaimed, silencing everyone in the dark, screen lit room in Washington and signalling a technician to put the call on speaker, as the Synod had done from the start. The powerful men and women assembled listened with rapt attention; in the background, someone was told to trace the call. 

"You won't be able to trace it, I'm in Denver, though," Michelle explained, looking around her nervously for signs of disapproval. 

"You were captured. Are you hurt? You're under duress obviously but I hope they didn't hurt you," the President said. 

"I'm fine but... I ah... I'm one of them now. A familiar. They know everything I know now, they used a truth serum on me." 

There was an angry outcry around the room followed by hushed muttering. 

"So they let you contact us... Michelle, what is going on?" 

"You're going to find this hard to believe but this is all Radek's fault. He attacked the Harrisburg facility and we barely escaped. He's trying to force a confrontation between us and the Beings. They've agreed to talk with you about peaceful negotiations; they're about as shocked by this as we were at the start." 

Looking around, Michelle tried to make sure she was doing okay. Chris gave her a nod but the faces of the Synod members on the screens were stern and unreadable. She assumed they would stop her quite abruptly if she misspoke. 

"Well, that's a bit hard to swallow, Michelle. I'm sorry, but by the looks on some of the faces here with me, I'd say this is what's called stalling. By our accounts, you've been in their hands for several hours and by your own admission, you're compromised." 

Michelle was at a loss; she'd told the Synod that this was exactly what would happen. With Beings, once you were compromised, anything out of your mouth was worth less than a lie directly from your enemy's. 

Chris looked towards the Synod in frustration. Weren't they going to do anything to help Michelle? It appeared not. 

"Mr. President, if I may," Chris spoke up. "It's an honor to talk to you. My name is Christopher Baryst, the Being you've been monitoring, Michelle arrested me this morning." 

"I'm aware of who you are. Son, if you hurt Michelle there will be..." 

"I won't hurt her," Chris interrupted. "She's my familiar now so it's my job to look after her." 

"I've read all sorts of reports about mistreatment of human ... familiars," rebutted the President. 

"I'll be fine, Sir," Michelle supported. 

Some of the Synod were starting to look a little irate at the dragon's boldness. However, none of them spoke up. 

"Look, this is going to be hard on both sides but it comes down to this. We don't want a war, and we hope that you don't either," Chris tried to explain. "It's going to be difficult to build trust but the first thing you need to know is that Radek isn't who you think he is. He isn't your friend. As far as any of us can tell, he isn't even part of our society. And, he is certainly far more powerful than he's led you to believe. He's set this all up to start a conflict between us, both Michelle and I heard it from his mouth only hours ago, before he tried to kill us both." 

"Why?" asked the President. 

"I don't know but a war can't be good, can it?" 

In the dark bunker, the President was searching the faces in the room for guidance, looking to his generals and advisors but ultimately having to make a decision based on his own moral compass. This was the moment any sane person in a position of power dreaded, when it came down to the line and you made a decision which would affect people's lives, a decision you would be remembered for. 

"It's true, Bob," Michelle added, using his first name was an established duress signal which indicated she was telling the truth. She doubted it would actually increase her credibility but it couldn't hurt. "Radek knew who Christopher was before he identified him to us, he's a Class One dragon, for God's sake, and he's very high profile because he's only just been discovered as a Being. Radek wanted to stir up as much outrage at us amongst the Beings as possible and did the same for us by trying to kill everyone at Harrisburg." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
The President took heart that Michelle was still cognisant enough to use a hidden message, even if he couldn't take it at face value when Beings were involved. If what she said was true though... Maybe he was a fool, but Robert Falconer wouldn't go down in infamy as the man who started the war to end all wars. 

"I want to believe you, but what's to stop them from turning around and taking our memories that any of this ever happened?" 

It was one of his biggest concerns; they had a very detailed failsafe in place which would trigger if it happened. People who needed to check in with their memories intact daily or very bad things would be set in motion. Still, it would leave them severely disadvantaged at the start of a potential war if their leadership suddenly developed amnesia. 

Michelle wanted to tell them that the Beings couldn't do it, that it had been too long. However, the Synod had very specifically forbid her to reveal that. She looked to the dragon in frustration and he gave her a wry smile, perhaps a tiny wink. 

"We can't," Chris spoke up. 

In the background, Robert and everyone listening heard an angry shriek as someone far away screamed, "How dare you!..." 

Recognizable words were drowned out afterwards as an unintelligible argument broke out amongst the Synod. 

"SHUT UP!" Chris bellowed away from the phone, taking another huge risk as he flouted the Synod's authority yet again. He'd taken it upon himself to ensure this whole situation didn't go too far south on his account. If he had to step on toes to do so, so be it. "Let me talk to them!" 

Ominous silence filled the room abruptly. 

"Sorry, Mr. President, as you can see, we're a bit high strung on this end, too." Chris paused, looking around the room to see some very angry faces. He wasn't even supposed to be doing the talking, but he couldn't help it. If Michelle wasn't allowed to tell the humans what they needed to hear, he would tell them. Besides, none of the Synod seemed even remotely interested in talking to the humans. 

In the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Reyla snickering. 

Despite the seriousness of the situation, the midnight elf couldn't help but laugh as the young hatchling overrode the Synod, an organization she'd always abhorred since it became dominated by the 'high' elf council. Perhaps he didn't know what powerful enemies he might be making, perhaps he didn't care. Either way, it only endeared the dragon to her further. She <em>was</em> going to tame him, claim him for herself one day. 

"Radek is a clever bastard," Chris continued. "It's been about four to six months since you all found out about us. I don't understand the magic involved but apparently it's harder and harder to remove specific memories as time goes on, especially when they are reinforced by more thought and constant reminders. It can also be very damaging, even deadly. We simply don't think we would get away with a global memory wipe of the world's political and military leaders, believe me, it's been the topic of some very healthy argument. Besides, we're scared you'll nuke us or something." 

The President paused, weighing the information the courageous young man had just given them, before he allowed himself a sigh of relief. 

"Christopher, that's very relieving to hear. Thank you. I want everyone listening to consider that this is exactly the kind of honesty we are going to need to get through this. I would be very disappointed if you were punished for explaining that to us. It puts to rest one of our biggest fears about dealing with you peop... Beings." 

The President decided he already liked this young man and as he spoke, a collective wave of relaxation flowed around the room of humans. Shoulders became unhunched, buttocks unclenched. Perhaps a Being attack wasn't imminent. 

"Thank you, Sir," Chris replied. Only recently a true Being, he was thrilled to be talking with the President, but the dragon helped him keep his cool in the high pressure situation. 

"You're welcome. Now, I can assume you aren't responsible for making decisions on behalf of all Beings, Chris, although perhaps those who are listening are?" 

"Yes," Chris looked around for help but still no one spoke up. 

"How about this," President Falconer said. "Why don't we all back down for the moment and collect our thoughts. It's been a trying day but I'd say that first contact has staved off any immediate, impending disaster. We will not strike unless we detect aggressive actions on your behest, but let me assure you all, you don't want to deal with the fallout if we do. With peace in mind, both parties should take a while to come up with some initial goals, terms we can hopefully start working on to achieve a global revelation of this, this 'Secret.'" 

Looking around the room, Robert noted the atmosphere had changed entirely. At least they had some idea what the Beings were thinking, rather than waiting in the dark to be struck down. 

"There's no chance you'd just forget about this entire thing and let us continue as we are?" Chris had to ask. 

The President allowed himself a chuckle. "I'm afraid not. This is too big to become a conspiracy. We are truly interested in peace if it's possible. One of the first things we realized was that you all have legitimate claims to live in peace as you need to. Heck, from what we can tell, you're all legal citizens of the countries you reside in." 

"You want a global revelation, but you must understand that you can't just do this overnight," Chris warned. "We'll need to have infrastructure and management in place before the public finds out. We're going to have to be careful about things on our end too." 

"Of course, this will probably take months to put in place as we bring in other governments around the world. Although, I imagine there are some countries we'll have to leave in the dark, North Korea comes to mind," the President thought out loud. 

"We could probably help with problems like that," Chris looked around the room for reassurance, finally receiving a couple of nods. "Okay, so we'll call again tomorrow once we've had a chance to discuss what our terms are." 

"I'll call this number again at noon EST tomorrow," Michelle clarified. "Thank you for hearing us out, Sir. Remember, cut all ties with Radek and re-examine everything he gave us." 

"We will," said the President. "And Michelle, I'm glad you made it out okay." 

*** 

Chris got a very stern scolding from the Synod. 

He knew he'd overstepped but hoped that it would be worth it in the end. Standing there, he couldn't help think that they were getting caught up in the details, stalling for excuses. 

What did it matter if he'd weakened their position by telling them about how memory removal worked? If they were serious about peace, they should be serious about it at the start and give humans a reason to trust them. No one else had stepped up to the plate and no one had stopped him from doing so either. Yet it seemed that that was somehow his fault, too. 

Perhaps he still considered himself a human. 

"You have no place negotiating on behalf of all Beings, and revealing our capabilities to the humans was a stupid mistake. It speaks to your inexperience, boy." Eramir delivered his verdict with a sly smile, enjoying having the young dragon pinned under his authority even from thousands of miles away. This could prove useful against Reyla, too, should ever step out of bounds as well. "Flouting our authority again will be met with punishment." 

"I apologize for overstepping the Synod's authority but I did what I thought I needed to to put the humans at ease," Chris reasoned while trying not to let the elf's self-righteous expression get to him. "They will never trust us if we don't deal squarely with them; holding a false threat over their heads isn't going to help." 

"You may have a point, young dragon, but those decisions are for us to make, not you," spoke a middle-aged witch sternly. 

"I'm sorry," he repeated. "You will have to talk to them eventually. I hope you can take Michelle's advice to heart when you do." 

Meanwhile, Reyla and John Guthrie could barely keep smiles off their faces. The young dragon had stepped on some powerful toes, but it was entertaining to see the rest of the Synod at such a loss while the youngster negotiated peace on their behalf. Having recently been almost completely human, he was probably the best choice they had. How were millennia-old Beings supposed to relate to modern human concerns? 

Chris and his party where dismissed as the Synod planned to continue discussion late. Already, someone was debating that a full revelation wasn't the best option, however from what Chris could hear, it seemed like most of the Synod knew it was probably their <em>only</em> option. 

As he started towards the exit, Chris noticed Michelle was still standing around, looking a bit lost. 

"Hey, are you coming?" 

"I ... ah, don't have anywhere to go." 

Chris chuckled; she really mustn't think much of him and didn't quite understand what being his familiar would entail. 

"Sure you do. You can stay with us for as long as you want, at least until you figure out what you want to do with yourself. However, I suspect you'll be very busy for the next months acting as a negotiator." 

She thought about that for a moment. Perhaps... yes, she did have a useful place for herself in this new world. The dragon was already walking away, his arm wrapped possessively around Annabel's waist with Susan and Lillian following along behind. 

She hurried to catch up. 

*** 

"Come on, Baby, how can you say no?" Annabel cooed seductively in his ear. 

She wriggled her soft, slender body down on top of him. He could feel her smooth skin teasing him ridiculously, the heat of her moist nethers against his testicles, so close to his erection, currently trapped against her supple navel. 

"Don't tell me you don't want to, I can feel that you do," she continued directly against his neck, kissing and nibbling the dragon's creamy throat. 

"I know, Dee, but I'm really tired and want to think clearly for a bit without falling straight to sleep afterwards. Can we please just wait until tomorrow?" 

Chris could barely believe the words coming out of his own mouth; he would have slapped himself if it hadn't been for the day's events. His arrest, his escape, a new familiar, the prospect of a global revelation... and Radek. 

As it was, he could barely resist as she slowly slid her entire naked body around on top of his in their bed, her skin sending shivers through him as it rubbed against his. 

"But I missed you," Annabel pouted purposefully, knowing it was likely to make him combust. 

She could understand that he wanted time to just think, but the fear and excitement she'd experienced with him getting attacked then arrested had her body highly strung, anxious, and obscenely horny. She needed some physical reassurance. Now reunited, with the naked dragon on his back, his delicious scent in her mouth and wings splayed out slightly on the bed with her pretty much sitting on his impressive crotch... he said he didn't want to. 

"I was gone two days," Chris chuckled, followed by a yawn. He was really worn out, having been interrogated twice, not to mention teleporting over a thousand miles while carrying Michelle. 

"You were shot at, arrested, and in case you'd forgotten, we were engaged," Annabel rebutted. "It was an eventful two days." 

She sat up a little, reaching above his head to put her hands on his purple forewings, holding him down onto the bed as she contemplated forcing herself on him. Her puckered little nipples were practically poking his eyes out and he wouldn't even suck them; he was being particularly stubborn for some reason. Was he doing this to her on purpose? 

"Please?" she whined, rocking on top of him, crushing her swollen, moist labia on the underside of his thick shaft. Her entire body was about to overheat with desire. 

Chris let out a heavy breath, but his dragon had an interesting idea so he ceded some control. He wasn't going to give in, but the least he could do was get her off. With his hands on her sides, he indicated he wanted her to turn around, which she did with an excited little yip. She loved cowgirl but they'd never tried reverse! 

Annabel held herself up, reaching for his penis to impale herself in this exciting new position but one of his powerful arms wrapped up around her chest and pulled her back against him. She was lying on her back on top of him, her ass cheeks making a snug cocoon for his hot erection while her head rested on his shoulder. 

A purple hand snaked down her right side, slow with an almost ticklish touch. It glided across her tummy, causing her breath to hitch as it started playing its way downwards through her short, trimmed brown curls, until he cupped her feverish mound, covering it entirely. She was so wet already that his hand slipped easily through her slick little snatch, exploring her secret place in detail, sending a shivering thrill deep into her core. 

Her labia felt so puffy and engorged beneath his fingers, so slimy and squishy with her excitement, radiating heat. She was really worked up. 

Annabel wriggled, spreading her legs and trying to drive her mound up into his hand. He didn't respond. She tried to roll back over to face him but found herself trapped by his arms as a low growl vibrated through his chest. She huffed out a tiny mewl of frustration, she must be dealing with the dragon. He wanted her still and quiet, but she had to consciously decide to relax, give in to him. She managed it. Barely. 

"Good girl," the dragon hissed in her ear, sending a shiver down her spine. 

Something inside her resonated to his voice; the little animal that she was rolled onto her back, presenting everything that she had to offer up to her lover, her mate, her master. She was completely his in that moment, so eager and hopeful. His to control, his to do as he pleased with, his to pleasure however he wanted. 

"I said I didn't want to, which I admit might seem startling. But please be patient. I would give you the same courtesy were our positions reversed." 

"Sorry," Annabel whispered, tilting her head backwards to kiss the underside of his chin. 

"Don't be," the dragon reassured. "I'll take care of you now but then we'll wait until morning for more." 

"I love you," she murmured happily, stroking her hands along his caging forearms. 

With that, he started to move his hand again, slowly at first, rubbing up and down on either side of her pussy, pushing her labia together, then pulling them apart gently to expose her deepest pink. 

Annabel moaned gently when he finally ran a wet finger directly through her slit, stopping just below her peaking clit. Already his gentle touch was driving her crazy and her hands clutched and fisted in the sheets beneath them. She couldn't help but move a little, squirming back and forth against his hand and no doubt wreaking havoc on his erection trapped between her peachy globes. 

She could feel the thick, arrow-like head prodding her lower back when she wasn't arching up into him. Her head tossed from side to side when he finally touched her clit with a drenched finger; she was so wet she could feel little trickles of her pungent excitement leaking down her crack every now and then. 

His other mischievous hand wasn't idle where it held her trapped, but toying with her small, sensitive breasts in succession, rolling her tiny, brown nipples back and forth between his big fingers. Her breath came fast and ragged, her pleasure making her grunt and cry out. 

"Chris!" she wailed, for no other reason than her body demanded she make some noise about the delight it experienced. God, she loved him! 

Her cries only encouraged him, increasing his stimulations as her body tensed with building joy. He carefully inserting a thick, clawed finger deep into her slick channel, curling it backwards while he rubbed her clit with his thumb. 

Annabel huffed and panted for a few more glorious seconds before it felt like her world fell away; a quiet, moaning gurgle escaping her throat. He'd hit that spot inside her which never failed. Her hips bucked upwards, once, twice, while pleasure wracked her twitching body and her universe exploded behind her eyelids. 

Then she was still, panting, relaxing as those wonderful little shocks whizzed through her for minutes as her body cooled. She'd almost fallen asleep when he finally removed his sopping, slippery hand from her mound, rolling them both to the side and pulling her to him. 

"Me, your dick, tomorrow morning," Annabel muttered sleepily as she pulled his arm up underneath her pert little breasts and held onto it as she fell back asleep. 

The dragon sighed. He should have just fucked her. Now his sticky erection was in excited agony, trapped against her, no doubt wetting her back with precum. It was always so deeply arousing to experience Annabel in orgasm, her sounds and smells. Her taste. The dragon brought his hand up to sample it off his fingers, so ripe and womanly, slightly tangy and a little sweet. 

The beast proceeded to lap the rest away with his forked tongue, savoring his mate's essence before giving control back to the human, so intent on revaluating the last few day's events. 

<em>Dragons always take care of their brood</em>, the dragon imparted as Chris kissed the top of Annabel's head. 

Chris lay awake for hours, his mind racing. He was tired and there were moments where he almost fell asleep before something popped into his head and jolted him back into an unshakable sense of foreboding. 

Michelle was one of his main concerns. Having taken the final spare room in the hotel suite/apartment with little fuss, he thought she was probably in some kind of shock. He'd have to watch her carefully and make sure she was adjusting. 

Jesus Christ, another familiar. Not only that, another woman for his dragon to go sniffing after. Hopefully, it wasn't like that with Michelle, though, hopefully their arrangement was both platonic and their living quarters temporary. 

If this huge revelation of the Secret went through, perhaps Being laws wouldn't require her to be under his supervision and she wouldn't need his protection. In the meantime, she would be invaluable in facilitating interaction between the Synod and human governments. She was going to be very busy. If Radek had managed to kill her... things would have gone very differently today. 

Radek. If he'd never sworn to uphold the Secret, who exactly was he? Certainly not part of the mainstream Being community. Perhaps more importantly, what did he hope to gain by eliciting a war between humans and Beings? Chris was inclined to let the Synod deal with these questions but the dragon felt that it had become personal between them. Perhaps the dragon was right, too; he'd attempted to kidnap him and blame him for the slaughter of those NSA agents. He'd planned to kill Susan and Lillian to get to him. 

Yes, it was definitely personal. 

As he lay snuggled around Annabel's comforting feel and smell, his mind even wandered to what this would all mean. A revelation. It was such a huge issue, he couldn't begin to comprehend what would happen. It would be such a hurdle for the governments to agree on a global policy, and for Beings and humans as a whole to agree on whatever they come up with, let alone stick to it. 

He took a long time to eventually drift off, feeling anxiety that there was no way this would go off smoothly. 

Just before dawn, he retreated into the Ether, reconnecting with his otherworldly aspect and replenishing his energy after the previous days of excitement and exertion. 

*** 

Annabel awoke with a start and instantly knew she was alone in bed. There was no warmth against her back, no arm around her middle, no erection between her buttocks. She didn't like it one bit. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
Resting up on her hand and looking around the room then at the empty space in their bed, she wondered if he was in the kitchen making coffee for Susan. Perhaps he'd gone to Susan's bed halfway through the night? That thought hurt a little, despite that she'd resolved to quell any jealousy she felt towards his mother. 

Her expression must have clouded because she felt a ghostly touch brush down her bare back, making her shiver. She couldn't help but smile then; he was still there with her. She flumped down onto the bed again, turning to watch. 

"Come back, Babe," she coaxed. 

It took a few seconds before the first cloudy, purple traces of him began to reappear, taking his time with the transition back into the Norm. The unfocused outline fleshed out quickly and soon she was face-to-face with the beautiful dragon again. Her dragon. 

He smiled back at her, draconian countenance bare inches away, eye-to-eye. He snaked an arm out, pulling her against him as she shuffled to help him drag her warmly across the sheets. 

"Don't do that, please," she said quietly, nuzzling against his chin. 

"I have to go sometimes. I think I could take you with me now. Do you want to try that sometime?" he asked, stroking her back peacefully. 

Bartholomew seemed to become excited by the idea of entering the Ether, rushing up from his favorite spot - curled around her belly button - to jump expectantly on her cheek. Annabel could only giggle at his antics, alive and boisterous. 

"Well, he certainly seems to like the idea. Won't it be dangerous for me, though?" 

"I don't think it would be too dangerous. Yesterday I teleported through the Ether to come back here. I felt how the dragon extended our influence to include Michelle when I pulled her in, I think I could do it with you. Besides, you've got Bartholomew, who knows what he'd allow you to do." 

"Yes, but I promised not to test his... our abilities until I understand more about magic. I'd prefer if you'd just be here when I woke up." 

"Okay, but next time I go, I at least want to try bringing you along. There's this idea I've had for somewhere we can all live, it's a bit complicated though and I need a guinea pig." 

"Do tell?" 

"It's a surprise," he smirked. 

"Tease," Annabel batted his chest softly while her other hand slithered between them to hold the angry head of his erection. 

"Already with the name calling? You little nympho." 

"Oh ho ho, that's rich coming from a verified motherfucker," Annabel retorted with no real sting. 

"Ouch," Chris responded before becoming more serious. "How are you doing with that?" 

"I'm okay. Susan and I didn't really have time to talk about it yesterday but now that it's happened I'm not going to put a blanket ban on it. Sometimes I just get... oh, I don't know... possessive?" 

Her feelings on the matter were by no means simple. 

"It's okay, I like that. Lord Guthrie seems to think there's something about dragon males which makes women get along with their other brood-mates more easily. Something magical." 

"Not this, perhaps?" Annabel slid a finger up and down the side of his erection. Teasing it would be payback for it poking her in the belly so rudely just now. 

Chris could only sigh as she tormented his shaft, tracing a single finger up over his crown before ghosting her fingers down in a cage over his fat cockhead and that forced a big twitch of pleasure out of him. She chuckled as she felt his cock jump under her touch. 

"How was it?" 

He could only assume she was referring to his episode with Susan and tried to gauge what sort of an answer she really wanted. 

"Amazing. Really hot, heavy but also very loving. She's a beautiful woman but hadn't done it in a long time, we really enjoyed each other." 

His honesty shocked her a little but it was good. She didn't want a lie. 

She gripped him more firmly in retaliation, stroking up and down. She brought her focus up to the dragon's face, searching his eyes. An inkling of the hot need she'd experienced at their first coupling was creeping back into her system. Her pussy was rapidly preparing itself for him and she felt the dangerous necessity to coax the dragon out again, to goad him into reasserting his possession of her, reassure herself that she was still his. 

"Think you're man enough to handle two women?" 

The dragon growled, too easily rising to her challenge, rolling them quickly so she was trapped beneath him on her back. 

Her legs were already falling open of their own accord as he reached down to position his mighty erection against her moist opening, spreading her thick labia and tiny inner frill to feel her heat against his tip. Without preamble he pushed forward firmly, brushing aside the tight resistance to his entry, sinking halfway into her clutching vagina and forcing a pleasured gasp out of his lover. 

Pulling back slightly, he thrust again into her warmth, so soft and tightly conforming to every inch of him. He didn't stop until his thick crown butted against the gateway to her womb and Annabel huffed, looking up at him with such an expectant, loving expression written all over her gorgeous face. He held himself there as she squirmed, filled absolutely to the brim and revelling in the pleasure that fact gave her. He leant down and kissed her sexy little nose, teasing his mouth across her face on its journey towards her ear. 

"What do you think, little girl. Am I man enough for you?" 

"Chris, I -" she started before he collected a fistful of soft, brown hair at the nape of her neck and silenced her with a dominating kiss. 

Pulling back and arching his whole purple body into her, Chris began a series of long, slow thrusts which made her moan throatily into his mouth as their tongues met carefully around his sharp teeth. His hips undulated lewdly, retracting and sheathing nearly his entire length in a languid pace which had Annabel coming to pieces in mere minutes. 

Her splayed legs involuntarily quivered and jumped as he slowly filled her, completely, again and again. He didn't release their kiss as she clawed at his purple sides in ecstasy, as her breathing through her nose became almost desperate and she gasped in air between their duelling tongues; he held it, too, as her entire body stiffened, her legs wrapping vicelike around him with her toes curled painfully. 

Annabel screamed into his kiss, his cock finally holding still deep inside her as she bucked wildly underneath him, sizzling pleasure consuming her entire being. She could feel her womanhood twitch, soak, and flutter but he was huge and stoic inside her, determined to have her cum for him again. Prove his dominance. 

As she calmed, he slowed the passion of their kiss. She felt limp and satisfied underneath him, his partial weight heavy and comforting on top of her. Annabel felt so loved and completed with him above her like that, so huge and masculine compared to her slim, soft body. 

When he looked into her eyes again, she gave him such a hooded, sexy, satisfied look he had to smile, finally breaking their lips apart and arching his hips into her again, this time aided by the added slickness of her recent joy. 

"Oh, Jesus, how do you do that to me? Fuck, that was awesome," Annabel moaned. "If I didn't know better I wouldn't believe we lost our virginities just over a week ago." 

"That good, huh?" he replied cockily. "So, am I man enough?" 

"You know I only said that to wind you up, babe. And reap the rewards." 

"I know." He pecked her swollen lips. "It seems to work though, doesn't it?" 

Annabel giggled happily, and Chris's purple face distorted in delight as the contractions of her diaphragm caused her flooded pussy to grip and squeeze his hardness all over again. His reaction only made her laugh more; that look of stupid adoration was priceless. 

"Fuck, Annabel!" He pulled her with him as he reared back on his haunches so they were sitting, still deeply connected. "You have no idea how good that feels when you squeeze it like that." He tucked down his nose and groaned in to her soft neck, breathing in her essence. 

She was slightly above him now, sitting on his lap, rocking back and forth gently on his pole. It was so thick as she rolled her hips, hitting every spot inside her as she wrapped her arms around his neck and into his short purple hair. "If you like that, just wait until I'm sick with a cough." 

"How..." Chris started. "Oh, I see. Yeah, that would be hot... kinda weird, though. Besides, you'll never get sick again with me around." 

He had to stop there for a moment as her small movements and now purposeful clenching wreaked havoc on his cock. 

"Oh shit, Dee! You feel perfect like that!" 

He couldn't help but grit his teeth and take hold of her hips, guiding her up and down, forwards and backwards, even in little circles on him. Using her body for his pleasure. 

They went at each other like that for a long time. Kissing and sucking at each other's exposed skin while they mated enthusiastically. Annabel loved riding him like that, being able to use her whole body to move on him, but also able to relax and let him take over if needed. She even indulged in her favorite little quirk: giving the dragon a series of love bites across his taut neck and shoulder in time with the waves of pleasure he unleashed upon her. Even as she did this, her little tattoo dragon nipped her in return, sending tiny shocks across her tummy and breasts. 

Chris loved seeing and feeling her lithe body arch and buck against him. He secured firm handholds in her amazing, peachy ass and pushed her body down onto his slick rod with each of his long upstrokes. He couldn't believe how hot and tight she felt on him, simply exquisite. 

"Yes! Yes, oh yes. Fuck me! Keep going, baby, I'm... ohhhh... I'm gonna cum again soon," Annabel moaned breathily into his hair, pulling his face down to her breast. When his tongue lashed across one of her tiny nipples she automatically arched back, thrusting down hard on his girth. 

"Ggrraahhaaa!" 

Seeing her sleek body arch beautifully like that broke something inside Chris. She was so perfect. So pale and soft, so small and seemingly innocent yet totally sensual as she impaled herself on him; her pose displayed every perfect feminine curve. She was so tight and moist on him, too, her lubrication practically flowing down his shaft in little trickles as her scorching channel shuddered in bliss. 

He pulled her up a little and thrust powerfully from below, hunching his entire body as he frantically sheathed himself barely five more times. Chris felt himself swell inside her, and he gave in to the orgasm which proceeded to devour him, starting right at the tip of his cock against her cervix, and coursing down through the rest of his body like wildfire. 

"Arraaooh, shit!" came his strangled cry against her collar bone. His first pulse of semen practically leapt from him into her womb. More jets of thick cum continued to shoot deep into his mate; he gritted his teeth against the milky skin just above her breast. 

"Yes! Oh, Chris, yes! Give it to me, I can feel it! I love you!" Annabel wailed as her body helplessly fell into her own magically-induced orgasm, milking him for everything he had to give her, feeling him ejaculate so hot and forcefully inside her. 

She felt the sharp points of his bared fangs against her skin; it made her blurt out her next words on instinct. 

"Bite me, Chris. I want it, please!?" 

The dragon roared in triumph inside him, ready to mark their mate and have her swell with their offspring. It was all he could do to hold back, clamping a hand quickly over his sharp mouth before he lost control against her perfect skin. His short fangs ached and dripped, filling his mouth with a spicy, tingling flavor and prompting thick saliva from his glands. He humped his cock deep inside of her with each of the last of his fading spurts, in a state of pleasured agony as he desperately held his mating instincts in check. 

Of his suffering, only a strangled groan reached Annabel's ears. She was too busy riding out her pleasure, clutching his head to her chest and rocking on top of him, hips twitching with every little aftershock. At her bellybutton, Bartholomew writhed and shook in ecstasy, feeding and pulsing from the rich magic his creator gave freely to their beloved mistress. 

Eventually, the lovers relaxed, slumping back onto the bed, an entangled mess of sweaty limbs and sticky, throbbing genitals. 

Catching her attention with a hand on her cheek, Chris kissed Annabel lovingly for a moment before pulling back to speak. 

"Don't say that again unless you really mean it, and everything that would follow. I doubt my dragon would let me stop him again." 

"I know, I'm sorry," Annabel soothed. "But I did mean it, in the moment at least." 

"It's okay. It was just really hard not to bite you. You said it right at the time I would have done it natural. My dragon went nuts." 

"It wouldn't be the worst thing, though. I do want children with you, Chris. What about when you meet another dragon? Aren't you going to start trying straight away?" 

"That's a little bit different, Dee, and that would probably take years to accomplish even if either of the females accept me as a mate. I want kids with you, too, babe, but I don't think we're ready for that." 

"Yes, you're probably right. It was just such a lovely thought in the moment. I love you so much, baby," Annabel whispered, leaning the bare inches between them to kiss the dragon passionately. 

"I love you, too, Dee. And you don't have to worry about when I find another dragon. You'll always be my First and I'll always love you." 

He recaptured his breath, staring deeply into her fawnlike, beautiful eyes. "You'll be my wife now, too." 

*** 

Michelle finally emerged as they were having breakfast around the kitchen bar. If she admitted it to herself, she was terrified to show her face. She'd finally wept herself to sleep, thinking about the day's events but most potently the friends and colleagues she'd lost at the compound. Her slumber was fitful but uninterrupted. 

At least until the pleasured screams struck her disbelieving ears at 7:13 am. 

Once the happy couple - she assumed Chris and Annabel - died down, the reality of her situation hit her again, just as hard as before, like a bullet to a Kevlar vest. Her close colleagues were dead, her boss missing. She was the sole survivor, the recent, reluctant familiar of a powerful teenage Being. A Class One dragon no less. 

It had all seemed a little fake yesterday, like a play or something, but it hit home this morning. 

Back when they'd learned about the class system, her agency had helped come up with contingencies for dealing with each of the classes and species, the appropriate force of action needed to take one down. On the brainstorm whiteboard, their best guesses for dealing with Class One Beings included airstrikes and cruise missiles. From what she'd seen of the dragon, none of this would even scratch him. He could simply phase into another dimension and emerge at will anywhere he desired. 

Now she was his property, and although he'd seemed kind and understanding yesterday, caring even, she dreaded what today would bring. She was alone, so deep into enemy waters she felt sure she'd sink and drown, overwhelmed. 

After she'd showered in her very own fancy ensuite, she changed back into yesterday's clothes, plus the slightly-too-big T-shirt Susan had given her last night to sleep in. It took a few minutes of self-convincing, telling herself that she was a proud NSA agent. Finally, she worked up the courage to peek around her door. 

"Good morning," Annabel chirped as she spotted Michelle from her post at the stove. "I've made Chris's favorite, banana pancakes, and there's plenty to go around... if you get in fast enough." 

Everyone turned to look at Michelle for a moment before Chris broke the silence with an enthusiastic mumble through a very full mouthful. 

"Teeear goord!" 

"Excuse my son's manners, they are really good, though." Susan came forward to strong-arm Michelle into a seat while Annabel loaded a stack straight from the pan onto a plate in front of her. "Annabel's training as a chief in the fall so she's our dedicated cook at the moment... when we don't get lazy and order room service that is. I'm getting spoiled living here." 

Michelle glanced up and found the dragon watching her. Determined to regain some of her composure, she held his gaze. 

He swallowed his mouthful and smiled, displaying his intimidating teeth and fangs yet again. 

It looked so absurd, a half-man, half-purple-dragon sitting at a kitchen bar in jeans and a black t-shirt with holes ripped in the back for his folded wings. Meanwhile, his obviously happy fiancé served him pancakes while his mother hovered over her. 

Absurd. 

Now where was the vampire? 

"Did you sleep okay? How are you doing?" Chris asked. 

"I'm fine," Michelle answered, defensive but not unfriendly. By his look, she could tell he didn't believe her. 

"Okay. Well, first things first, in the spirit of everyone getting along... Lillian? I'd like you to apologize to Michelle for how you treated her yesterday." 

Susan took in a sharp breath, looking over to where she'd last sensed the invisible vampire, not knowing how she would take to the request for an apology. 

"Absolutely, I planned to do exactly that." 

Michelle jumped, locating the disembodied voice as coming from near the big silver fridges. There wasn't even a shimmer or rift in the air to give the vampire away. 

"I'm sorry for treating you so roughly, Michelle. I'm a vampire, you see. We have violent tendencies lurking close to the surface and I was worked up after failing my duty and having to leave Chris to be arrested by you." 

"Incredible," Michelle marvelled, able to hear the voice but still unable to detect anything else. Then the words sank in. "Um. Thank you for the apology, Lillian. There was no permanent damage after he healed my neck." 

"And I would like to apologize to you, Lillian," Chris said earnestly. "I didn't mean to grab you like that and I certainly didn't mean to tear your skin, I just didn't know how to get through to you." 

"There's no need, Chris. I'm a big girl, I can handle a little rough and tumble." 

Lillian downplayed the whole incident, even though it had highlighted to herself her feelings and instincts towards the dragon. She'd once again tried to steel herself against him last night, unsuccessfully. That venture had ended rather explosively. Pleasurably. She couldn't help herself when he was fucking his little girlfriend; the noises they made were too easily the music to her own release. She was practically addicted to it. 

Now she smirked. She would get at least some revenge. "That's not to say I won't take it out on you this morning though; I'm going to whoop your ass all over the mat." 

Chris could only groan; she would do it, too. Although, this time he'd be in his half-form and he planned to surprise her with some phasing, if he felt up to it. 

"So, ah...What will I be doing today? Or for the rest of my life, for that matter?" Michelle asked after her first bite of pancake. "Mhhrmm, Annabel, these are really good." 

Annabel beamed. 

"Well, the Synod has already made a 'request' to Chris that they borrow you to help them get ready for their phone call at noon," Lillian said. 

"I think you'll actually be flat out between the governments and the Synod for the foreseeable future," Chris added. "If that's what you want to do?" 

"Yes, I think I could make a big difference there. If the Synod actually listens to me, that is." 

"They're going to have to. They have almost no connection to the human world and need your help badly. Once this is resolved, though, who knows. You could do whatever you want. They might abolish the idea of familiars altogether, or we could still all wipe each other out in a global war. In the meantime, you're one of us, a keeper of the Secret. You'll be under my protection from other Beings and you're supposed to ah... obey and serve... all that good stuff. As far as I'm concerned though, you've been forced into this so you can do whatever you like as long as you don't get yourself into too much trouble. I'll try to help you out any way I can." 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Thank you, Chris. What about my things, though? Where am I going to live? Also, I need to buy some emergency items as soon as possible. Some clothes, toiletries and a new set of glasses." 

"Don't worry about all that," Susan said. "I can help you get what you need this morning before you go to the Compound. I'd say it's best to live with us for the moment, there's plenty of room. You're his familiar after all and the accommodation is gratis from Lady Reyla. We'll sort out your past life as we go but I imagine you did a lot of traveling and weren't exactly tied down?" 

"Yes, you're right, I guess. There isn't all that much to set in order, I'm sure I can get someone from the agency to clear out my apartment and send my personals here or into storage." 

"Great, it's settled then, other than a few details." 

Immediate concerts covered for the moment and feeling generally more optimistic about her future, Michelle devoted herself to eating the tasty breakfast while studying the others. 

Chris was clearly the center of the group; Annabel openly adored him and though Susan held herself back as the younger woman didn't, Michelle quickly suspected there was something more than motherly affection going on there. Barely seconds after she'd come to that conclusion, it was confirmed as mother and dragon shared an open mouth kiss before she excused herself briefly to call into work. 

"It's complicated," sighed Chris, catching Michelle's shocked look. 

"I bet." 

"She isn't my biological mother. I guess you could say she was my nurse when I was young, before my parents were killed. She raised me in hiding as a human for all these years and we love each other dearly. That kind of transformed into what you saw as I... transformed into this," he gestured at himself, the dragon. 

"But you said you were engaged to Annabel," Michelle countered. 

"All I can say about that is that dragons don't really do one-to-one. The males usually gather groups, broods. It's a bit of a problem actually, it's skewed our population to be about one-quarter male, three-quarters female." 

"And apparently he has some sort of magic which makes us docile enough towards each other for it to work," Annabel added, wrapping the dragon up in a hug from behind and delivering some kisses into his neck. 

Michelle raised her hands in surrender. 

"I'm not going to pretend to understand and I'll try not to pass judgement." 

"Told you it was complicated." 

Susan came back a moment later, producing a small vial which Chris quickly recognized from the rather memorable flight back from London. Its slightly purple contents shimmered ominously on the bench. 

"You can't be serious," Chris swallowed. "She'll never do it." 

"She has to," Susan replied. 

Lillian outright laughed. 

"Do what?" Michelle and Annabel asked in quick succession. 

"This is a potion to prevent Chris's pheromones from affecting you, Michelle. You need to take a drop or two in your food or on your skin every morning. I'm a little surprised they haven't affected you already, perhaps you aren't attracted to him." 

"I think I'm in too much shock to be attracted to anything," Michelle diverted. "A potion. Like a magic one? It's not like the truth syrup yesterday, is it? That was horrible." 

"Hrrmm," Susan murmured thoughtfully. "No, it's not like the truth syrup, you won't even notice it. It's about your only option, unless you want to become dragonstruck?" 

"No, no I don't want that." Michelle blushed. 

"Oh my god, you have to tell her, Mom," Chris interrupted, his voice almost panicked. 

"Do you want to know what's in it? Or remain oblivious?" Susan chuckled. 

Michelle considered the option for a moment. 

"If it works and doesn't hurt me, I think I'd rather not know, judging by his reaction." 

Susan quickly droppered a little onto Michelle's arm while Annabel pinched Chris in the background until he divulged the main ingredient into her ear in an embarrassed whisper. Her eyes shot wide and she covered her mouth, trying to suppress her giggles. Susan was evil, but she was probably right. Michelle would never agree if she knew. 

"Okay. Now, you mentioned you needed some new glasses. How bad is your eyesight?" Susan asked. 

"It's not great, I'm near-sighted so I wear glasses almost all the time. It hasn't been too much of a problem though because most of my work is reading or combing over computer screens," explained Michelle. 

"What would you do to have clear eyesight again?" Susan probed. 

Michelle's mind momentarily took her back to a rather emotional memory. She was fifteen, watching the optometrist scribble omenously in his notes while her mother held her hand. He looked up at her with a sad smile and started explaining that she would have to wear glasses for the rest of her life. 

"Anything," replied Michelle enthusiastically. She really hoped the witch wasn't stringing her along. 

*** 

"Are you sure this is going to work?" Michelle asked for the umpteenth time. 

"No, it's completely experimental," Susan said."However, I see no reason why it wouldn't, it's got powerful healing properties, beyond simply closing a wound. It could take a few doses, though. There are probably other ways to do this but who knows how much they cost?" 

"Gross. Okay, let's do it." 

Susan handed her the two eyebaths, which Michelle placed and inverted, blinking quickly and trying not to think about the fresh dragon saliva hopefully doing its work in her eyes. 

She held it like that for several minutes, staring into blackness as the discomfort faded. Her arms and neck became sore from holding the pose. 

"That should do it," Susan indicated. 

Michelle thankfully dumped the baths in the bathroom sink and began flushing her face and eyes very thoroughly with water. Reluctant to open her eyes and be disappointed, she dried her face carefully on the offered towel and sighed deeply. She opened them gradually, squinting, then blinking away the blurriness from the water. Looking up, the improvement was instantly visible. 

Michelle hadn't truly realized what she'd been missing out on until her vision was repaired. Astonishment and disbelief silenced her; everything was clear again, like when she was a child. It was... it was magic. 

She very nearly cried. 

"Oh my God, thank you, Susan," she mumbled through her hand over her mouth, attempting to stem back the tide. 

"It's fine, dear." Susan rubbed her shoulder as Michelle looked at herself in the mirror. 

Michelle could feel it coming, her chest broiled as a meltdown loomed. She'd been on edge for the last six months and after everything that had gone wrong yesterday, this was such a wonderful gift. 

She bolted for the bathroom door, making a b-line for the startled dragon, and wrapped her arms up around his neck. She gave him a heartfelt hug which he quickly returned as she finally broke down. 

"You'll never understand how much this means to me," she sobbed into his chest, taking ragged breaths of his pleasant scent. Her friends were dead. She was surrounded by those she considered enemies in an entirely alien world of magic, fantasy, and science fiction but as the dragon wrapped his strong arms around her firmly, she knew she was at least safe with him. Even more surprisingly, she no longer regretted being his familiar. Her facade of strength had fallen, but at least she'd found a friend. 

Chris was a little worried by her breakdown but stroked up and down her back comfortingly. The dragon even dared to lower his head and plant a kiss into her short, black hair, smelling strongly of the shampoo she'd recently used. 

"It's going to be okay, Michelle," he soothed. 

"Thank you so much," she looked up into his purple face, so unusual with his flattened snout and shocking reptilian eyes. However, she could still see the young man there, too, and couldn't remember the last time she'd felt this close to anyone. "Thank you for everything." 

"Hey, I didn't do anything. Susan was the one who came up with the idea. You're welcome, though," Chris replied as she pulled away, still holding one of his purple, taloned hands. 

Michelle thought he probably didn't grasp the depth and sincerity of her thanks, playing the whole situation down. Well, she would let it slide for the moment, perhaps not forever, though. 

"This gives me so much hope, Chris. If you can fix something as important as my eyesight so easily with magic, there's no telling what humans and Beings could accomplish together. I'm going to make sure I get a chance to see it happen. I'll devote myself to making sure the revelation goes off without a hitch." 

*** 

The dragon's huge body crashed to the padded mat underneath her and Lillian smiled; she still had him beat in his half form. Straddling his tummy, she held one of his arms in the lock with which she'd forced him to the floor. 

It hadn't been easy. He was both stronger and faster in this form, more resilient. He'd landed a few hits but he was no match for someone who'd been training in Being combat for hundreds of years, and who had undead strength to back up her training. It was enjoyable sparring with him, though, a real thrill for her inner beast. 

Perched on top of him, she could feel his solid chest heaving between her legs, watch his handsome face as it twitched in pain. Like this, at her mercy, the young dragon would have been hers to do with as she pleased if it weren't for the blood pact. What exactly she wanted to do to him was still a matter of debate between her instincts and apprehensions. 

Suddenly, her smile vanished as she found herself dropping to the floor, letting out a startled huff of air as her ass hit the mat. Too late she registered that the dragon had phased into the Ether; a ghostly touch at her neck told her he was already coming back through to the Norm behind her. 

Chris merged back with a triumphant growl in her ear, one arm forming a cage around her elbows, uncaring how he squeezed across her huge breasts. The other held her neck in a threat of simulated death. 

"Well done, Chris," Lillian acknowledged. "I think I might have gotten away if I'd been expecting you to phase, but once you had me I didn't put up a fight." She tilted her head back to look up at him briefly before giving a token, futile struggle against his hold. "Always be careful when you phase in training, you could cripple me if you got it wrong." 

"How's that?" Chris asked behind her as he held her pinned against him, automatically scenting the back of her neck, deliciously teasing him with her subtle smell of honey, woman, and vampire. 

" I forget you haven't been taught these things. Phasing in combat is so devastating because, with skill, you could phase part of yourself inside your enemy's body and do internal damage, bypassing any of your enemy's physical defenses. The only real way to stop it is to have some sort of barrier mechanism around you or to move so quickly that the phaser can never catch up from inside the Ether." 

"So... if I'd misjudged and actually positioned my hand inside your neck when I merged back..." 

"Yes, you would have displaced parts of me in favor of your hand." 

"Oh shit, I'm sorry, Lillian," Chris quickly released the amazon who got gracefully to her feet and offered him a hand. 

"There's no need to be sorry, Chris, it is part of your aspect. Just like I'm very strong as a vampire. That's why you'll be such a terror on the battlefield once you have training. The way you used it then, to get into a position where your enemy is at your mercy, is very effective. Only a little tingle on my neck gave me any warning and by then it was already too late. Practice to become faster and more accurate as you merge." 

"Okay, thanks. I only really did it because I was frustrated that I could barely manage to touch you." 

"I've got centuries of practice, Chris, I'm a Class Two vampire; possibly the most physically-oriented Being species there is. There's no shame in being beaten in practice fights, especially by me. You're getting better, too, learning how to avoid me and trying new ways to hit back. That's very good." 

Lillian's compliments were sincere. He was a great sparring partner and she suspected a day would come when he would surpass her in every way. 

"Thanks, Lillian," Chris smiled, feeling heartened. He felt a little better, and he would certainly be even more careful about phasing in the future. 

"As you've discovered, you can also phase to move very quickly from one place to another." Lillian watched his half form admiringly as he took position to come at her again. What wouldn't she do for her own pair of wings like that! Sadly, she still had several hundred years to wait. 

"Yeah, I was thinking about that last night. I went about six hundred-forty thousand meters per second to get from Harrisburg to here as fast as I did, which is roughly about point two percent the speed of light. I can't decide if that seems fast or not, considering I teleported." 

"Nerd," Lillian smiled at him affectionately. "Most people call it teleporting, but different Beings have different methods of accomplishing the same thing, so the term doesn't strictly apply." 

"It was so weird. I felt absolutely nothing except time passing. There was no sense of consciousness, I just knew that a few seconds had gone by, then I was back." 

"You don't have to always use it like that, you can just jump a few meters, reposition yourself to defend against or attack your opponent conventionally without the risk of being close enough to phase into them. That's very effective, too, and completely demoralizing for your enemy." 

"I think I've done that by accident before," Chris said as he thought back to his first romp in the Ether, when he got stuck there for almost an hour because his dragon hadn't bothered to tell him how to get out. "Do you want me to try that now?" 

"No, why don't we go over some blocks and holds as a cool down before we go make that inquiry you mentioned at the compound." 

She proceeded to teach him the throws she'd been using so successfully against him. Of course, the best way to teach him in her mind was to use them on him all over again. Lillian's idea of a "cool down" had Chris panting and sore in no time at all, even in his half form. Her amusement was easy to read by the time they wrapped up. 

When they were finished, Chris went to find Oslo. The grizzly was using one of the resistance machines to exercise his inhuman strength. 

"So... I've got an idea about a place to live. But, it's going to be quite the project and I'd like your advice." 

"Go on," Oslo replied in his gravelly voice. 

"Underground," Chris stated, looking to the werebear as he hoisted an obscene weight before continuing. "I want to buy a property, an old lot or a disused house, it doesn't really matter. Then build a subterranean residence below it. I just need someone who knows how to do it." 

"Seems like a good idea so far," the bear huffed, muscles straining under the load, he finished his set before continuing. "Security, privacy, secrecy, everything you're probably going to need, if you don't mind having no view that is." 

"That's what I was thinking." 

"I may know just the guy to help. He won't be cheap, but that isn't a problem because you can always trade for future favors."

Chris changed back into his human form in the gym shower. The added strength and reflexes were great for sparing... and lovemaking... but it wasn't practical to be a dragon all day, especially when you had to go outside. 

He, Oslo, and Lillian made their way to the main office at the Compound, traversing the underground network of tunnels which linked a lot of the Being sector together. He really liked the underground vibe; it resonated with his dragon but he still wondered if he wanted his own home linked to the system or not. 

His workout had relieved some of the stresses of the past days, giving him an upbeat lookout. He was grateful for that, even though he knew it would wear off soon enough. 

Lillian directed Chris to the properties office, a single desk manned by a venerable goblin. There were a number of Being-owned options so he took the portfolios of several he thought might fit his idea. 

"Couldn't I just buy a property on the human market by trading my gold for cash with Reyla?" Chris asked, a little confused about why it was necessary to go through the Being system. 

"Well, technically you could," Lillian reasoned. "But, there are laws which require us to respect human currency and not create opportunities for them to notice us. Buying up human-owned land and exchanging large quantities of magical currency for human money are certainly frowned upon. It's another opportunity for some accountant or bank officer to notice irregularities... although, perhaps that isn't particularly relevant any longer." 

"Huh," Oslo grunted, continuing with a huge grin on his shaggy countenance. "No thanks to you, Lillian. All these years of experience and you can't even stop a bunch of humans from capturing your hatchling dragon." 

Lillian hissed half-heartedly at his friendly poking, although she did still feel self-blame over the incident. However, from the discussion she'd had with Chris that morning, she was no longer certain there had been something she could have done to stop it. 

Oslo called his contact and arranged a late morning meeting at his house. It was slightly away from the Being district but not too far. The werebear, dragon, and invisible vampire decided to take the thirty-five minute walk instead of using a pool car. It was a pleasant day; sunny but with a healthy breeze to keep the temperature manageable. 

The three essentially being introverts, they were mostly quiet on the walk, enjoying the day, but occasionally Chris would ask them some questions which were happily answered. 

Both older Beings enjoyed the dragon's company; having often worked as a team, Chris fit in well. It made it seem more like they were just out for a walk as friends rather than being his bodyguards. Oslo even howled with laughter as Lillian described Chris's discomforting encounter with the flight attendant on their return from Scotland. 

"Hey, it's not funny," Chris defended. "How am I supposed to deal that every day?" 

"Ahh, the curse of irresistibility," Oslo teased. "I bet you had fantasies about women falling over themselves to get to you. Not so glamorous now though, is it?" 

"No. And all Lillian did was sit there and laugh." 

"Well, she wasn't a threat to your safety," the vampire reasoned. "Besides, Susan's potion sorted her out very nicely after your little escapade to the bathroom. Remind me, what exactly went on in there?" 

"Shut up, Lillian." Chris blushed scarlet. 

At Oslo's prodding the vampire whispered the wicked details and he promptly burst open with laughter again. 

"You're too easy, Chris, but don't worry; we'll cure that bashfulness soon enough." 

When they arrived at their destination, Chris was surprised to see just a normal, two-storied suburb house. He didn't know why but he still had this expectation that Beings lived in obscure and unusual places. 

A knock on the door was quickly answered by a large, middle-aged man who offered him a hearty handshake and a friendly smile. 

"Hello, you must be Christopher. I'm Stephen Sibon. Come in, come in. It's nice to see you again, Oslo, Lillian." 

Stephen welcomed them into the hallway and Chris caught a faint familiar smell he couldn't quite place. 

"Hailey, come downstairs." 

"Just a minute, Daddy!" came a high pitched call from upstairs. 

"Come on through to the kitchen, what can I get you to drink? I was just about to fire up the coffee machine." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
"That sounds great," Chris said. 

"I'll second that," Oslo agreed. 

"Nothing for me, thanks," Lillian joked. 

"Of course, my dear. Sorry," Stephen replied, smiling. "I don't need to feel uncomfortable with three carnivores in the house, do I?" 

Oslo chuckled. 

"You know who I am, then?" Chris asked. He hadn't been sure how much Oslo had told him. 

"Well, of course I do, Chris, and it's an honor, you're the talk of the town at the moment. My wife works at the Compound so we got the news on the day you were presented to the court. My daughter, Hailey, is going to freak out when she meets you, just wait and see." 

Stephen had a broad smile on his face, the smile of a loving father who took pleasure in playfully embarrassing his kids. 

"Oh? I knew there was a bit of a buzz on Maginet but I hadn't realized it had gotten that far." Chris was bemused, a fair amount of sarcasm seeping into his words. "What species are you? If you don't mind me asking, that's not rude is it? Your house does smell somewhat familiar." 

"No, it's not rude to ask. We're werebison. That's why I made the joke about carnivores." 

The smell clicked in Chris's mind, like the clean scent of happy, healthy cows had back on Jethry's farm. 

"Well, you're the first I've ever met. Does that mean you're vegetarians?" 

"Precisely, a quirk of biology and magic, I'm sure you have a few of your own." Stephen flipped dials and started grinding coffee beans on a very impressive looking espresso machine. "Now, Oslo tells me you want to design and build a house, an underground one, no less." 

"That's right-" Chris started. 

He was interrupted by the pitter-patter of bare feet on the stairs. A second later, a gorgeously petite young woman rounded the corner from the hallway. Chris was momentarily stunned by her sudden appearance. Her body was small and tight, perfectly proportioned except for her breasts, which were very large on her slight, five foot frame. 

Her long blond hair was pulled into a ponytail and she was wearing an outfit so gratuitously revealing it boggled belief. Tiny pink shorts barely covered her delectable butt, and an old, white tank strained to contain her bulging chest and exposed about six inches of toned, bronzed midrift. It was the kind of outfit which would have been criminal on an older woman, something a girl would only wear to flounce around her bedroom. 

"Daddy, I... oh, hello Mr. Peterson. I didn't know we had guests, Dad." 

Her blue eyes nervously flicked towards the cute guy standing over by her Dad. He was simply hot. Handsome and broad with ruffled blond hair and piercing blue eyes, matching her own. Her nostrils flared as a delicious scent tickled her nose. From her position, he looked almost twice as tall as her, although it didn't make him seem too intimidating. 

Her current state of undress hit home and she withdrew slightly, wrapping her arms across her stomach to try and hide some skin. 

"Well, I'm sure you wouldn't want to miss the chance to meet our guest. Chris, this is my daughter, Hailey," Stephen introduced the two with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. 

"Hi, nice to meet you, Hailey," Chris offered a handshake and a smile, which she daintily accepted. 

Hailey looked like she was about to say something back when her father interrupted. 

"He's the dragon you've been gossiping so much about with your friends." 

A series of expressions played across her face in a matter of seconds. Disbelief, appraisal, disbelief, excitement. She couldn't believe the dragon everyone had been talking about was in her house, talking to her Dad. Talking to her. He was so cute, too! Her friends were never going to believe her. 

Then she remembered what she was wearing in front of him and blushed beet red. 

"Oh my God! Daddy, I'm still in my pj's!" she wailed, spinning to run back upstairs before she died of embarrassment. 

"Serves you right!" Stephen called after her, laughing. "Eleven-thirty is high time to be out of bed." 

Lillian and Oslo were laughing as well. Chris managed a smile, but a large portion of his mind was still devoted to processing just exactly how beautiful the young woman was. Clearly she still had some growing up to do, but that didn't stop her from being smoking hot. 

"She's just turned nineteen," Stephen explained. "She's been pretty sheltered, though, hasn't really blossomed and gotten her confidence yet. I just can't resist teasing her sometimes." 

"I'd say she's certainly blossomed, Stephen," Lillian gibed. "You should watch out though, he's a dragon after all." 

"Don't go near my daughter." Stephen suddenly became serious, piercing Chris with that intimidating stare all fathers automatically perfect as soon as their daughters are born. 

"I didn't..." Chris stuttered apologetically before everyone in the room burst out laughing again. 

"Jesus!" Stephen roared, "You're just as easy as she is!" 

"Great," Chris groaned, before smirking. They'd gotten him. 

"Seriously, though, if she likes you, go for it. She could use a boyfriend. It might get her out of her room for more than a chance to spend my money." 

"Let's change the subject, shall we?" Chris almost pleaded. 

"Fine, fine," Stephen turned back to the coffee maker. "Go through to the lounge, Oslo knows the way. I'll be through in a minute when this is done." 

*** 

Upstairs, Hailey was a giggling mess of nerves, excitement, and not a little arousal. It had felt so embarrassing to be so exposed like that in just her nighties, so naughty. 

Was he really a dragon? The dragon? 

She hugged herself tightly and rolled around giddily on the bed, mashing her large, over-full breasts into the covers and feeling them leak slightly, relieving some of their pressure into her super absorbent bra cups. She even brought her hand to her nose, attempted to catch his scent where he'd touched her. 

Were all the rumors she'd heard about dragons true? Perhaps she'd have a chance to find out if her Dad ended up working with him. Yes, she'd have to pester her father tonight to make sure he did. It would serve him right, too. 

*** 

It was at least an hour later when the conversation downstairs began wrapping up. 

"This all sounds doable, Chris. Expensive and time consuming, but doable," Stephen said, browsing through some of the property pamphlets Chris had brought along and rereading some of the notes he'd taken. "I've done underground work before, it's certainly challenging." 

"I'd also like to keep the project as below the radar as possible," Chris explained. 

"Understandable, given your situation. Does that mean you'll want to help me do the work yourself rather than hire others?" 

"That had been my hope. I'll be learning some skills at the same time as building my future home that way." 

"Excellent. Having another physically enhanced Being will be vital and I imagine your magic will be very useful as well but you'll have to put in some hard work to learn it. Now, I don't mean to doubt you but how are you going to pay for all this?" 

"I've got gold, we can swap that to whatever currency you want through Lady Narlakis," answered Chris. 

"That and you'll have a Class One dragon to call and ask for favors in the future," Oslo added. 

"Yes, something which shouldn't be underestimated," agreed Stephen. "Okay, I can start on this almost right away. Our first step is to find a suitable location with a layer of firm bedrock to build into. I'll go visit these properties and make a few inquiries of my own while looking into permits. Once you've decided and brought a property, I can begin designing to your specifications and we can start excavation. Don't get your hopes up for a quick finish, though, this could take anywhere up to a whole year even with both of us working at the construction." 

"I understand, but I'm eager to get started and have a place of my own." 

"That's the spirit. I look forward to working with you, Chris," Stephen said enthusiastically, his mind already probing out possibilities for this exciting new project. 

"I think we'd better start heading back to the Compound soon," Lillian warned, thinking that the Synod's phone call with the humans would probably be over by now. She was anxious, eager to hear what had transpired. 

"Okay, Chris, I'll contact you through Maginet with an update in a few days. Perhaps an initial contract for my work, too." Stephen ushered them towards the door as they got up. 

Chris thought he saw a brief flash of movement up by the banisters of the second story landing and smiled to himself. He'd hoped Hailey might have come back downstairs after a while but it appeared she was too shy. 

"By the way, Stephen, there's something important going on with the Synod at the moment," Lillian added at the door. "It's big, but don't necessarily believe any rumors you hear, there are good people trying to sort it out." 

"Well that's... disconcerting." Stephen watched her with a frown on his brow. "Care to elaborate?" 

"Sorry." Lillian shook her head. 

"I think there will be an announcement soon enough," Chris said. "Anyway, thanks for taking me on, Stephen. Susan and Annabel are going to love the surprise. Goodbye." 

*** 

The announcement did come, but not soon enough to prevent further anxiety. 

Oslo had parted ways with them once they were back inside the underground network, but when Chris and Lillian tried to enter Lady Narlakis's courtroom, they were turned away. Put out, they meandered back to the hotel, speculating quietly about what exactly was going on behind those closed doors. 

Chris collected Annabel, who was more than happy to go for a walk. Together under Lillian's watchful eye, they did a bit more exploring, taking in the sights, smells, and sounds their hidden little world had to offer. Somewhat forlorn, Chris wondered how long the tranquil, secret community would stay that way, given the negotiations that were happening at that very second. 

However, Annabel succeeded in distracting him from his dark mood with her short black skirt and sandals, showing oh-so-much creamy, smooth skin. He hugged her tight to his side as they walked, leaning down to breathe into her hair and kiss her scalp gently. 

"What was that for?" she asked, looking up as they walked and surprised to find such a serious look on his face. He must be really worried. 

"Because you're beautiful, and I love you," he replied with a slight smile. 

Annabel paused their progress down the footpath and quickly went up on her toes to kiss him, looking right into his blue eyes with passion. She snaked her arms around his neck and grabbed a little handful of his short hair, pulling him down to her while their lips met, gently running her tongue across his. 

"It's going to be okay, baby," she reassured as they broke apart. 

"I hope so," Chris murmured, nudging her to continue their walk. 

When they got back to the hotel it was late afternoon; Susan and Michelle still weren't back. 

Chris felt rather disconcerted now, wondering what was taking so long and why he and Lillian hadn't been allowed to be involved. Perhaps he really had pissed the Synod off yesterday. He hoped it paid off with the goodwill it bought with the humans but he still dreaded the possibility of the negotiation falling apart. 

"So, are you going to tell me what you did this morning?" Annabel asked, attempting to draw him out of his daydream as they sat together on one of the couches. 

"Hmm? Oh, I went to talk to someone about building a house." Chris smiled as he saw Annabel's eyes light up. 

"A house? For us? Tell me!" she bubbled, wriggling up against him. 

"No, it's a surprise," Chris replied, fully expecting to receive at least a patented Annabel pout for his response, perhaps even anger. 

She went for the pout, batting her eyelids up at him and thrusting her quivering bottom lip out slightly. Her beautiful hazel eyes seemed to double in size, filling with what she would have him believe was real hurt. 

"Come on, Chris, that's not fair. Please?" 

Lillian chuckled from an armchair, watching the girl's antics. The vampire wouldn't put it past her to bribe the dragon with sex next. 

"All we did was meet an architect that Oslo knows and talk about what I wanted. He's going to be checking out properties over the next few days. That's all. The rest is just an idea in my head still." 

"Ung, you say that like it isn't a huge step. 'That's all.' Yeah, right." 

"Well, that's not strictly <em>all</em> he did," Lillian said, prodding at the dragon, as she was quickly growing very fond of doing. "He also met a cute little buffalo heifer who was promptly besotted with him." 

"Oh, really?" Annabel cocked an eyebrow. 

"Jesus, Lillian, it wasn't like that," Chris defended with exasperation. 

"Oh, yeah," Lillian continued, "she's got a tight little body and a great big pair of milk-filled tits. I bet your dragon there would just love to 'help' drain them every morning. Grew up on a dairy farm, didn't he?" 

She shocked both Chris and Annabel with her unusual vulgarity but the vampire just snickered at them. 

"Why, yes, he did. So, when shall I pack my things and move out?" Annabel had joined in, enjoying her lover's discomfort. 

"I can't fucking win," Chris said with a sigh. "All I did was shake her hand and say hi." 

"You should have seen it, Annabel, she got all flustered when her dad told her he was the dragon she'd been gossiping about on Maginet. It was so cute, the little tart freaked out and ran upstairs because she was half-naked." 

"So, does she have a baby or something?" Annabel asked Lillian, wondering why the vampire had mentioned the Were's lactation. 

"No. Bovine Were females tend to produce milk year-round from the onset of puberty, even when they're in their human forms." 

"Interesting, how about it, Chris? Would you like that?" Annabel gibed, giving him a playful slap on his firm chest. "And don't just think I've forgotten about this house your building." 

"No comment." 

Thankfully, Chris heard movement out in the hallway and went to let Susan and Michelle in before the two women dug him any deeper into his hole. He gave Susan a brief, warm kiss before guiding a worn out Michelle back into the lounge to sit down. He returned shortly with a glass of water for her and waited while she drank. 

"So, what happened?" 

"We did it. We actually got them to agree to a full revelation and hashed out the initial terms," Michelle said with a tired smile. She'd had an understandably stressful day. 

Several beeps echoed around the room as all their Maginet devices fired up with a new notification. 

"Is that it?" Chris asked. 

She just nodded before resting her head back and closing her tired eyes. 

Chris collected his tablet and returned to the couch, Annabel leaning on his shoulder to look while he read aloud. 

<em>By order of the Synod of Beings:</em> 

<em>Due to the actions of an unknown group of conspirators, the Secret has been breached irreparably. Humans in positions of power have been made aware of our existence for several months, allowing them time to dedicate resources towards assuring a full revelation and liquefaction of the Secret.</em> 

<em>At this stage, revelation is the only option. As of yesterday, we are in negotiations with leading human officials to achieve peaceful terms which will be advantageous to both parties. This will require sacrifice on both sides to achieve and will no doubt rewrite the way we live our lives.</em> 

<em>In the meantime, follow the Secret strictly. The human governments need time in order to prepare infrastructure, for example, to set up the newly-formed Being Interaction Agency to interface between our worlds and prepare methods to manage the human population's reaction.</em> 

<em>A public breach of the Secret at this stage would be devastating. Any Being whose actions contribute to such an event will be met with our harshest judgement.</em> 

<em>As a show of goodwill, and in preparation for the changes this revelation will require:</em> 

<em>-All interaction of a supernatural or magical nature between a Being and a non-familiar human is hereby prohibited indefinitely. This includes, and applies especially to vampire, gargoyle, or any other form of human feeding.</em> 

<em>-The familiar-taking process is suspended under review and now requires Synod approval.</em> 

<em>-The memory alteration charm is banned from use permanently, on both humans and Beings. A global detection ward is already in place to notify us of its use.</em> 

<em>In the meantime, continue living your lives in Secret. Do not panic or despair, a revelation will eventually give us far more freedom than we live with today. However, vampires and any Beings whose needs cannot be met under the new conditions will be catered for by your local rulers until the revelation is achieved.</em> 

<em>A major blockage to human relations has been loss of life caused by Beings and the callous views we often express in our disregard to the worth of human life, a flow-over in many of our older individuals from the more savage, ruthless centuries proceeding this one. We must change our mindsets to see each other as equals, perhaps not in individual powers or capabilities, but as equal inhabitants of this planet. Therefore, in the future, Beings will be subject to human laws, backed up by Synod sentencing.</em> 

<em>Have hope and be at peace, Beings. The unknown awaits us, but we believe it can lead to a healthier, brighter existence if we work together towards that end.</em> 

<em>Updates will be sent out at least weekly and any further modifications to legislation will be broadcast forthwith. Please contact your friends and families to relay this message and contact your local authorities with any questions you may have. However, please have patience in this regard as they may not have all the answers to your questions. The Revelation is still a work in progress.</em> 

<em>Lord John Guthrie</em> 

Chris reread the message and looked up smiling. 

"Michelle, this is great! I never thought the Synod would agree to this, to change our laws so quickly." 

Michelle grinned back at the dragon, feeling genuinely happy to have his praise. It felt good after such a nerve-wracking day. 

"Oh, they weren't as optimistic as Lord Guthrie made them out to be. I think they're just trying to put on a good face." 

"Nonetheless, to have them come out like this, ban vampire feedings, and force Beings to treat humans with respect... it's groundbreaking," Susan said. "I can't help but think there's going to be some fallout, though. Not everyone is just going to take this lying down." 

"The Synod won't tolerate any signs of rebellion at this point," Lillian explained, leaning over the back of the couch above Chris and Annabel to read their tablet. Perhaps she was a little too close. His damnably tasty smell was thick in her nose, making her fangs itch and ache as her mouth automatically filled with thick saliva. "They can't afford to appear weak or merciful on such a big issue. I expect several examples to be made." 

"Examples?" Annabel asked with a frown. She hoped it didn't mean what Lillian made it sound like. 

"Executions of the first vampires to break the new rules," Lillian replied bluntly. "That would be my prediction anyway." 

The girl was so innocent and ideological. Sometimes the vampire couldn't understand what the dragon saw in her. Leaning down over Annabel, she felt a sudden, vampiric flash of jealousy and anger. It should be her at the dragon's side...! 

Lillian snapped out of it, withdrawing the hand which had already been sneaking to wrap around the young woman's slender throat. She was disgusted with herself, reaching to kill an innocent, friendly girl out of nothing more than her inner beast's desires. Desires she couldn't even act on because of that bitch-drow's stupid blood pact. Being reminded of it yet again only increased her misery and self-loathing. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 9|
--------------------------------------------
The vampire had a minor eureka moment then, coming to two key revelatory conclusions. 

Firstly, she was well and truly dragonstruck, head-over-heels for the masculine Being before her. Despite what she might like to try and convince herself, the cursed blood pact was the only thing holding her back now. 

Secondly, she was going to somehow kill Reyla Narlakis and nullify their pact. Then she'd be free to sink her aching fangs into the dragon's soft neck and suck greedily on his rich blood, never bothering to taste another ever again. With any luck, the dragon would be sinking his mighty cock deep inside her sweltering womanhood at the same moment, satisfying another equally delicious ache. 

"Are you okay, Lillian?" Chris asked, looking up at the distracted vampire. "Annabel asked you if it would make vampires rebel against the Synod." 

"Oh...Sorry." Lillian collected herself quickly, noticing she was highly aroused, to the point of conspicuousness. She retreated a little way. "No. Well, maybe. Only a few could rebel before they get scrubbed out. The vampire council must be onboard with the Synod's decision, which means anyone trying to rebel will have no backing from anyone in power." 

"It's like they're stuck in some sort of feudal system, from the dark ages," Annabel mused to herself. 

Chris did actually notice the enticing, honey-tinged smell of aroused vampire in the air and gave himself a secret smile. He wondered what the beautiful, buxom goddess had been thinking about. 

"Are you going to be okay with this, Lillian?" he asked. 

"Me? Don't be silly. There's no shortage of donated blood and I'm sure I could find a willing, delicious source to have on hand." She tried not to make it too obvious she meant him. 

"Actually, the President said that they would meet any shortfalls we have in our blood supply and agreed that consensual feeding would be legal after the Revelation," Michelle added. "I think that went a way towards sweetening up that ancient Transylvanian lord." 

Lillian laughed. The oldest vampire in the world was actually a big old sweetie... usually. 

"So, what's next, Michelle?" Chris asked. 

"Well, Lady Narlakis wants me to assist her for the next few weeks. She said the Synod is going to be meeting every day while they come up with a treaty outlining Being rights and the ways you can use your powers. After that, I'll be in charge of setting up and heading the first branch of the Being Interaction Agency, the Denver branch." 

"Wow! That's huge, Michelle!" Annabel exclaimed. "Aren't you excited, that's got to be a promotion, right?" 

"Yeah, I guess. It's all a bit overwhelming. It's such a huge task to prepare for this, to think of all the ways we're going to have to manage public response. For example, the President said they're not even going to bother getting every single country onboard with this, just all the biggest and easiest, relying on intimidation, shock, and Being support when they finally announce the reveal. The Synod seemed to think they could disable the militaries of any countries that try to hunt down Beings or start skirmishes." 

"You're certainly going to be busy, perhaps this is your calling. I mean you managed to capture and deal with me okay." 

Chris couldn't help but chuckle at the recent memory, how haughty and confident Michelle had been as she'd arrested him. He wanted to see the return of that woman. 

"Maybe," Michelle agreed, giving Chris a tentative smile. "I think my calling at the moment is dinner and bed, though." 

"How about we get some room service and watch a movie?" Susan suggested. 

"That sounds wonderful." 

"Michelle, what about Radek?" Chris had to ask. 

"He's gone, Chris. Completely off our radar and my boss at the NSA is still missing. We can only assume he was either on-board with Radek or that Radek has made him disappear. The Synod said they had their best people dedicated to finding him but that's all they're saying." 

*** 

They ended up having pizza, eating it on the very couches and armchairs they'd ordered it from as some sort of adventure/comedy film played out on TV. 

Michelle initially found it infinitely bizarre that Beings could behave like this; enjoyed watching human TV and movies, eating junk. Although, she guessed it kind of made sense. Beings still had to fit and blend into the human world, so why not take advantage of its comforts and entertainments? 

Susan and Annabel took the opportunity to cuddle with Chris on the sofa while Michelle lazed in an armchair, as did Lillian, visible again after sunset. 

Michelle almost fell asleep a couple times, looking over to watch the two women pamper the young man with kisses and pets as he swapped his attention between them. They weren't even pretending to follow the movie. She thought he must be in heaven. Two beautiful women happily sharing his affection; wasn't that every guy's fantasy? She had to admit, it was kinda hot. 

Suddenly, after a little whispered conversation, Susan got up off the couch and hurriedly dragged Chris into her bedroom. Annabel was left to her own devices, looking a little put out. 

"You just let that happen, with your own fiancé?" Michelle asked. 

Annabel straightened herself out a bit before answering, meeting the older woman's eyes. "Yes. I'll have him to myself tonight when we go to bed. But it's okay for now. Oh, and I'll have him in the morning, too." 

"He can do that?" Michelle asked, disbelievingly. Her own sexual experiences indicated that sex was a one-and-done affair, not necessarily providing much pleasure for herself. 

Lillian smirked before explaining. 

"Dragon males are considered superlative lovers amongst Beings. They have neigh unlimited stamina and pheromones to drive a woman into unbelievable states of arousal. That's not to mention the magical transfer properties of their semen or the sexually addictive stimulant they can inject to induce fertility. The fact that there are only seven alive gives them almost mythical status." 

"No way. You're kidding me." 

"Can't you tell he's attractive, has some sort of draw which constantly pulls you towards him? Don't believe me? Why don't you ask her?" Lillian pointed at the blushing young woman left alone on the couch. 

"Well?" Michelle asked when no answer was immediately forthcoming. The subject had arousal dewing her inner depths. She couldn't help it as her imagination ran wild without confirmation or denial of the vampire's ridiculous claims. 

"It's true," Annabel whispered before getting louder, pride entering her voice. "We took each other's virginity but I can't imagine there could ever be anything better. He... ah, well, I'll just say it... his cum makes you orgasm as soon as it hits you, no matter where. And it's very... palatable." 

"Get out of town," Michelle whispered in shock, making Annabel and Lillian laugh aloud at her turn of phrase and comical expression. 

"Oh yes, Annabel here is the envy of every unspoken-for, red-blooded woman in hundreds of miles. If you had magical senses, you could see her and that little tattoo glowing with his energy after every time they go at it. Which, by the way, Annabel, is in no way discrete with the amount of noise you two make." 

Annabel blushed even more but was happy, smiling at the thought that the dragon was hers and other women envied her. 

"Is he... oh, God. Is he... you know, big?" Michelle couldn't stop herself, the sex talk was sucking her deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole, emboldening her. 

Annabel giggled, shaking her head. She couldn't control herself enough to give a straight answer, didn't know if she even should. 

"Is he?" Lillian asked, eager to hear the verdict now that the question was out in the open. She had her own suspicions, but as a woman of unusually tall and large stature, she had a preference for well-endowed men. 

"Of course," Annabel managed to blurt out before falling into hysterics. 

"Wow." 

"Details, woman, details!" Lillian pushed, squeezing her thighs together and pushing her temped sex into the cushion below. 

"Uh-uh. Now way," Annabel laughed. What was she supposed to say, that she never quite managed to get him all the way inside her before he butted against her womb? That she struggled to wrap her lips over the flare of his cockhead? That he even got slightly bigger in his half form? 

"So, Lillian hasn't?" Michelle asked. 

"No," Lillian answered, keeping her voice as steady as possible. 

"But I thought... oh." 

"You know I'd let you, right?" Annabel started nervously, she didn't know how the vampire would react but she could see the drawn, slightly pained look on her face and wanted to relieve it. "I see the way he looks at you..." 

Lillian was rocked by Annabel's assertion, her generosity towards such a selfish and dangerous creature. 

"Annabel, it's not that simple. I'm not allowed to, and if I ever did couple with him I wouldn't be able to resist drinking his blood. From what I've heard, my vampire would become addicted and I'd never settle for anything else. It's hard enough just being around him all the time." 

"You want to, though, right?" Michelle prodded, missing the seriousness of Lillian's confession. 

"What do you think?" the vampire sighed. 

*** 

In the bedroom nearby, Susan was busy enjoying her allotted time with Chris. 

She'd let him undress her, slowly, exploring her breasts and teasing her neck and tummy with his wicked lips, enjoying the wonderfully sexy little nibbles with which he pampered her skin. 

He was currently attempting to convince her she should allow him to give her oral, rubbing his nose in her full bush and kissing her thighs as she stood with her legs closed to him. 

"No," Susan breathed as he continued to chip away at her resolve with his sinful touches, making her insides quiver and leak slightly between her thighs. She was already drenched. 

"And why not?" Chris chuckled, muffled slightly as he tried to worm his mouth towards her core. Already his face was misted with her essence, his nose and mouth full of her womanly scent. 

"I said, I want you to fuck me." 

Susan gasped as he managed to snake his hot tongue deep enough between her legs to brush her clit. She pushed his head back and pulled him up by the hair until he was standing above her again. Leaning forwards, her full breasts squishing delightfully into his broad chest, she wrapped her arms up around his neck and nibbled his ear playfully. 

"I need you inside me, right now," she added in a husky whisper, falling backward onto her bed and pulling him along with a happy giggle. 

Her legs parted as they righted themselves after the tumble, playfully struggling against each other for a moment. Suddenly he was looking down at her so seriously, barely inches away with his satisfying weight pinning her to the bed. 

"Hi," she whispered, reaching up to brush his cheek as they studied each other. 

"I love you so much, Mom." 

"I know, baby," she breathed, feeling her emotions overflow. He'd made her so happy, falling into their new relationship so thoroughly. 

Guiding his head down to kiss him gently, she could feel his erection laid across the heat of her mound, up through her forest and onto her navel. It felt so hot, she could've sworn it was pulsing. She needed him. 

"Show me. Now, please, Chris." 

Chris felt her hand brush down his side, making him shiver as it reached between their excited bodies to grasp him. He pulled his hips up and back, giving her the room she needed to align them. Her legs were splayed high and wide, he could feel her slickness against his crown as she briefly rubbed him between her plush labia. 

Suddenly he was in position and he couldn't hold back. With only a little restraint, his hips pushed forwards and he groaned in ecstasy as his cock pierced deep into her. So soft, clingy and hot. 

"Oh fuck! Oh yes, Chris! Yes!" Susan screeched in delight as his thickness slid all the way home in one quick, long thrust. She didn't care about the twinge of pain she felt as her insides stretched to accommodate him so suddenly, she only cared that he was inside her again. Right where he belonged. 

He held himself still for a moment to deliver a kiss to her panting mouth before he started thrusting with mind-bogglingly pleasurable strokes, slowly out and quickly back into her core, as deep as she could stand to take him in her quivering little pussy. Angling his hips occasionally, she cried out as he kept her guessing where his girth would push and rub at next, emphasizing her pleasure. 

Susan keened with each thrust, so satisfyingly full with the only man she loved, feeling so complete and cherished. His hands rubbed up her flanks or down across her thighs, sending little shivers of sensation across her skin as his erection stirred a climax into existence in her molten core. 

He wasn't being gentle anymore. He was really giving it to her, grunting in satisfaction with each of his long thrusts. Susan felt her entire body quickly rise and tense, pleasure building behind a flimsy barrier. She gasped for breath as he pinned her to the bed and fucked her, her breasts mashing up into his chest. 

Chris felt her near her limit. She was so sensitive to him and it felt so damn good to be inside her. His lips toyed across her neck and up into her damp hair, finding her tender little earlobe to play with and nibble. 

"Come for me, Susan, just let it go." 

Instantly, her limbs froze as her body obeyed his low command. He thrust deep one more time and held still as she came alive. 

"Ahh! Hhoouu! Keep going, baby, please!" Susan begged as the damn burst inside her and pleasure overflowed her banks. Her body bucked and shook, arms and legs locked around his torso as he began thrusting again at her request, pushing through the rhythmic tightening of her slick vagina. 

It was almost too much. She nearly begged him to stop, but moments later she was thankful for her perseverance as another huge wave of pleasure crashed over her. All she could manage was an unintelligible, disbelieving moan in response. 

Chris didn't even bother trying to hold back; fucking her through an orgasm was a doomed endeavor. She was so hot as she came, clutching him in a frantic grip with both her pussy and her limbs, locked around him to prevent his escape. 

His dragon roared, preparing to release a blast of energy to their lover. He felt himself expand, his abdominals tensing in that glorious moment at the brink, his eyes shut tight in pleasure as he thrust as deep as he could. 

Then he released. 

"Fuck!" he growled into her shoulder as he felt his first pulse of semen race the length of his shaft, feeling those indescribably mingled pleasures of delicious tension and exquisite release. He felt the added sensation of the magic flowing through him, setting his body alight before it all somehow flew out the tip of his cock with his seed. 

It was quickly followed by more powerfully jetted squirts. On cue, Susan whimpered, her orgasm renewing as his scalding, thick ejaculate first peppered then flooded her cervix. 

She went limp in his arms as he finished, amazed how long he continued to spurt. Each shot triggered another set of contractions from her quivering vagina, which in turn sent another bolt of pleasure across his over-stimulated cockhead and down his shaft. For a moment, he thought it would never end. 

"Holy fuck!" Chris breathed against her skin as he finally finished. "I...I don't think I've ever come that hard before. You're amazing, Susan." 

He kissed her neck but felt no response. A little worried, he pushed his weight off of her with shaky arms and sat back on his ass. 

"Mom?" 

<em>Give her a moment,</em> his dragon advised. <em>She's just a little overloaded</em>. 

Her head lolled to the side against the pillow without his support; her eyes were closed and her breath came heavily from her heaving, sweaty chest. 

Chris couldn't help but chuckle, feeling his firm penis twitch inside her overfilled depths, their essences leaking thick and white from their mated sexes. He leaned back over her, resting on his elbows so their bodies touched but he wasn't putting as much weight on her. Kissing across her cheeks and unresponsive lips, he smiled in pride. He'd fucked this gorgeous witch silly. 

A few moments later, she began kissing back weakly. Her eyelids fluttered, revealing beautiful, confused blue pools. However, confusion quickly melted into pure lust and love as she came into her surroundings again, feeling him and his essence deep inside her, his magic coursing her body to the point where she thought she would burst. 

"Hi," he said, smiling cockily down at her. 

<em>What are you supposed to say to that?</em> Susan wondered as she processed the sluggish, heavy happiness flowing through her veins, making her weak and sleepy. 

Smug satisfaction was written all over his handsome face, and she couldn't exactly tell him not to let it go to his head. He'd just given her three quick-fire orgasms until she'd passed out. He should be proud of himself; she was proud of him. 

"That was unbelievable, Chris," she said honestly as her breathing slowed. 

"Thanks. I think it was the most intense I've ever felt." Chris lazily rolled them onto their sides, still joined by their sticky, satisfied sexes. 

"Mmmhhh, I can tell. I'm absolutely overflowing with magic. You've got to stop putting so much into me or I'll... " 

"Explode with pleasure and be knocked unconscious?" Chris laughed, his movement teasing them both. 

"I'm serious, you could fry me," Susan warned as she felt him begin toying gently with one of her nipples. 

"Buy a surge protector," he quipped back, giving her a firm tweak. 

"You're terrible." Susan blushed. "Not going to let me forget that, are you?" 

"No, Mom, of course, I'm not. I made you pass out. You don't really want me to forget though, do you?" 

"No, baby, I want frequent reminders. I love you, and that was phenomenal." 

"I love you too... Want to go again?" he asked hopefully, still firm inside her heat. 

"Oh, fine." Susan pretended to be put out before smiling and kissing her son's lips affectionately. "Just let me grab a crystal out of my purse. I brought some home from work just in case we did it tonight." 

Susan crawled off his erection with some effort and a lewd, squelching pop, her body sluggish and unresponsive. She felt empty as her insides readjusted to his absence while she rummaged at the edge of the bed for the small, clear, quartz crystal. When she returned he spooned behind her with his wet, swollen, penis against her ass cheeks. 

As she grasped the crystal to her chest and began draining his excess energy, he slipped himself back inside her, thrusting languidly into her depths and forcing a moan from her throat. 

"Oh my God, Chris, you don't even know what you're doing to me," she groaned, his cock filling her again, forcing pleasure into her body. 

The crystal pulsed purple as he turned her head and silenced her moan with his lips. 

"I'm fucking you, Susan," he murmured into her hot, smooth skin. 

"Mmrrm oohhhhh, Baby, yes, you are. Don't stop." 

He didn't. 

They made love slowly like that for what seemed like hours, neither in any sort of rush. They lay unmoving for minutes at a time, just enjoying the feeling of their union while they kissed. Eventually though, they would start moving against each other again, building their pleasure until they gently came together in a hush of whimpers and whispered, loving promises. 

Susan barely managed to drain what he'd given her the second time into the crystal before she was nodding off with his softening penis still inside her. Chris eventually slipped from her spent womanhood and tucked her under the blankets.

--------------------------------------------
Emerging into the living room somewhat sheepishly after dressing, he discovered Annabel asleep on the couch. It was quite late already. 

He hoisted her slender form in his arms and took his sleepy fiancé to bed, cuddling up behind her, savoring her warmth and soft, vanilla scent. He and his dragon were at peace, content with their lot, surrounded by loving, beautiful women. 

The crisis with the humans was averted for the moment and although his dragon had some reservations, Chris could see the benefits a successful Revelation would bring, now that it seemed to be a real possibility. It really would lead to a much more open existence for Beings if their magic didn't need to remain hidden. 

His happy musings were interrupted when his phone buzzed on the nightstand, the upturn screen indicating that he had an incoming call. He had half a mind to let it ring out but reached over Annabel and answered tersely. 

"What?" 

"Christopher?" came a feminine voice down the line. 

"Yeah, who's this?" he asked less crossly. 

"This is Petra Godran, sorry for ringing so late. Elizabeth said you'd be expecting my call?" 

Chris's stomach fell away into the bowels of the earth and he exhaled deeply instead of answering. 

"Christopher?" 

"I'm here," he replied. "Yes, Elizabeth said you'd call but I wasn't expecting it so soon. To be honest, with what's been going on with the humans, it faded to the background a little." 

"I understand. John Guthrie filled us in on your involvement, it sounds like he was very impressed with you." 

Chris chuckled at that. All he'd done was run when he'd seen the opportunity and perhaps overstep his bounds with the Synod. It didn't feel very impressive in the aftermath. 

"Thanks, I guess. What can I do for you, Petra?" 

"Well, she would never admit it but Claire is very anxious to meet you. I guess we both are. It might be hard for you to understand but as a female dragon, we really don't have much desire to mate with other species. She's already rejected the other dragon males and gave up hope of finding a mate in her lifetime. She's been so excited since she heard that Elizabeth thought you would be a good match. I know it's sudden, but could we drive up and meet you the day after tomorrow?" 

Petra waited with baited breath; it really wasn't only her daughter who was anxious to meet the young male. 

Chris pinched the bridge of his nose. "I've got quite a lot on my plate at the moment, Petra. But heck, why the hell not. What harm could two more women do in my life?" 

"Spoken like a true male dragon," Petra mused happily. "We're in San Diego, so we can get to you in the evening if we start driving really early." 

"Okay, I'll send you a link to my address in Laramie. I think it would be better to meet there instead of at the Denver Compound." 

"Oh, is there trouble in paradise?" Petra asked. 

"Not really, I think my dragon would feel better about meeting you two on home turf, though." 

"I've got a good feeling about you, Chris. I'm really looking forward to meeting you, Claire is practically bouncing off the walls." 

"That's a somewhat daunting expectation to live up to. I hope I don't disappoint." 

"I'm sure you won't, dear. Goodnight." 

"Goodnight, Petra, call if you need to sort out any details. I'll see you day after tomorrow." 

He set the cell phone down with an exasperated breath. 

"Whossat?" Annabel mumbled sleepily. 

"That was trouble, calling to arrange a date on behalf of her daughter." Chris couldn't help but be sarcastic about his fate, to be drowned in a sea of women. Still, what better way to go? 

"Being silly," Annabel scolded half-heartedly, her other half was asleep. 

"I know, baby, I'll tell you tomorrow. I love you, Dee." 

"Love you," she murmured back as he switched off the lamp and tried to fall asleep, falling back into his aspect instead.

Chapter 6 -- LTPC

<em>Hi folks,</em>

<em>Sorry about the wait. Thanks for the encouragement over the years.</em>

<em>I'm still working on chapter 8 and will release 7 once I'm happy with it.</em>

<em>A thanks to WideAwakeNow for helping with editing.</em>

***

"Annabel, wake up," Chris gently shook his sleeping girlfriend.

"Hrmm? What is it?" came the sleepy reply.

"Open your eyes."

Reluctantly, Annabel forced her eyes open and was met with an unfamiliar and altogether unsettling sight.

As she blinked away sleep, everything looked strange; greyscale and transparent where there should have been colour and texture, lit with an otherworldly purple light she couldn't place the source of.

The Ether.

She jolted, her body shedding its blanket of slumber instantly; sitting up in bed to face the culprit of her inter-dimensional travel. A gasp past her lips as she laid eyes on her lover, positively radiating with the purple essence of his aspect.

"Chris... you, you look... you're glowing."

"Thanks Dee, you don't look too bad yourself," he chuckled, scooching closer and running a hand up her side to cup one of her small, naked breasts playfully.

"You know what I mean," Annabel held his hand against her chest, interlocking her fingers with his. "You're pulsing purple."

"That's just the dragon soaking up energy. How's Bartholomew?"

Annabel found the excited enchantment prancing around her thigh, letting out puffs of smoke across her skin, apparently quite chuffed about being in his creator's aspect.

Looking around, she was stunned by the absurdity of her current position. The room was the mirror image of their bedroom back in the Norm, but everything looked like it was made of milky shadows.

She was in another dimension, herself and Chris the only 'fleshed out' objects visible.

"How is this possible, Chris? We took science together, didn't we? How are they going to explain stuff like this?"

"I don't know, Dee, perhaps no one does for sure. Clearly the universe is larger and more complicated than can be defined by our current understanding. Isn't that scientific enough?"

"No," Annabel wasn't convinced. "How did you get me here?"

"Well, when I did it with Michelle, I felt my dragon surround her in a layer of energy so that I would be responsible for the drain required to maintain her in the Ether. I did the same thing for you and the cost is manageable; plus I'm absorbing energy around us all the time."

"It might have been nice to be awake," she protested.

"Hey, I was just trying to find somewhere to put you so I didn't have to listen to your snoring, another dimension seemed appropriate."

Laughing, Chris fully expected to receive a blow about this sensitive subject, together they'd only just begun to explore the joys and problems arising from having a permanent bed mate.

"I," whack. "Do," whack. "Not," whack. "Snore!" Annabel beat out a rhythm on his barrel chest as she pushed him back on the bed until he captured her in a hug and kissed her into submission.

"Yes, you absolutely do, babe, but it's cute as hell. It's not even loud."

"Hrmmph," was her only reply as she stilled her play-struggling.

"Don't be like that," Chris chuckled. "I love it. Hey, check this out."

Chris released her and got off the bed, walked over towards the door, passing straight through the wood with little resistance.

Alone for a moment, without the extra purple light he seemed to shed, Annabel was gripped with a jolt of fear until he poked his smiling face back through the door so just his head was sticking through.

"Cool, huh?"

"Okay, that's pretty cool, goofball. Just don't leave me alone in here, it's pretty scary."

"Sorry. Come try it."

"How does it work?" Annabel asked as he took her hand and dragged her through the door into the ghostly hallway. "If we can do that, why don't we just fall through the floor?"

"Both beautiful and smart," Chris praised her for noticing the inconsistency. "As far as I can tell, it's all about what you intend to do. You want to walk through the door, so you do. Unconsciously, you're expecting the floor to support you, so it does. Does that make sense? I'm still trying to figure it all out."

"Surprisingly, yeah. Now I just have to stop myself from thinking about falling through the floor."

Chris took that moment to show off what he'd learned in the last few days during his limited explorations of the Ether.

Leaping into the air, he dove headfirst into the floor, making Annabel squeal in concern as he disappeared. Half a second later, he resurfaced as if the floor was a pool of water and proceeded to swim laps around her. She couldn't help but laugh, he was obviously in his element, like a duck in water.

"That is so weird," Annabel mused. Her mind wandering to the almost limitless applications this ability could be put to. "Are you sure it's safe for me to be here?"

"The Ether has its own dangers but I think it's pretty safe, you're here with me and I can take you back whenever you want. I'm using my energy to keep you here but I think with training, you and Bartholomew could learn to enter the Ether on your own. He looks pretty happy here after all."

"He does, doesn't he?" Annabel watched the tattoo dragon, now glowing bright purple, strut around her torso, spreading that tingling warmth she was only just becoming accustomed to over her skin. "Okay, it's just, I feel uncomfortable here. Like I'm out of place and something is pushing for me to leave."

"I suspect that's because we're working against the natural order to bring you here. It's my aspect so I don't feel anything like that. Now, do you want to go for a walk or go straight back?"

"I'm naked."

"You don't say?" Chris teased, "Who's going to see us? Lillian's over there in an armchair and she probably wouldn't notice if you sat on her lap."

Annabel balked at that image before going over to inspect the statue-like vampire. She could have been sleeping, or just sitting dead still with her eyes shut.

To Annabel, watching the voluptuous bodyguard sit unbreathing seemed like an invasion of privacy, like she was observing a personal moment of weakness. Her hair had been let down from its usual, practical pony tail or bun, falling softly around her pale face. Framing those luscious, wide lips.

"She's so beautiful," Annabel murmured, bending to get a closer look at Lillian's ghostly form in the strange light.

"So are you, Annabel," Chris whispered as he wrapped his arms around her slender form from behind. She could feel his semi-soft penis twitch against her rear, agreeing with his words. "Now, let's go explore a little."

"It would feel strange walking around naked."

"Come on, Dee, I've been dying to get out of the apartment. Besides I'd love to watch you walk around naked."

"Flatterer."

Chris hugged her more firmly, nuzzling against her ear as his arms caged her waist and stroked her flanks. He practically enveloped her with his larger body.

"It's true, you're completely beautiful, I could watch you for days."

Annabel was touched and thrilled by the contact, the deep seductive purr and sincerity of his voice. How could she resist that?

"Mmmm that feels nice, baby. Okay, let's go take your midnight stroll, so long as you only pee against trees."

"Unh, fine," Chris grunted, "go get my collar and leash."

"Now there's an interesting idea."

They left the apartment, passing through the door with no resistance. Chris was surprised to note several unknown arcane runes protecting their room but they didn't hinder their passage, on the way out anyway.

Annabel initially balked at walking through the lobby of the hotel naked but she held Chris's hand as they even passed right through a clerk and walked out into the night.

He couldn't help but be captivated by her beauty.

Sure, he'd seen her naked in their bed and knew the exquisite pleasure she allowed him as he held her and took her again and again on said bed. But there was something about seeing her stroll naked through his ethereal playground which struck the dragon as the epitome of beauty. The way her skin shown milky white in the strange light, the way her body moved and flowed as she walked at his side. He especially loved her exquisite ass and the little dimples on her back as she moved, the hints of her ribs, and the cutest tiny jiggle that ran across her small, firm breasts with each step. He was lost in her.

The Being district was a much more interesting landscape that Chris was used to. Clearly, it was a hotspot of energy transfer between the dimensions due to the concentration of magic.

Magical scripts and wards littered some walls like graffiti and there were an abundance of Ether dwelling plants making a living where they could. Chris identified them to the best of his ability for Annabel but was stumped by several of the scrubby bushes, lichens, and weeds growing out of the very pavement or climbing the buildings.

A couple of fist sized balls of pulsing green energy even streaked over their heads, apparently giving chase to each other. Further down the street, a large web covered the entrance to an alleyway, its sizeable, many legged occupant munching on one of the unlucky orbs.

Annabel didn't liked that one bit.

It was much more lively than he had expected, noises occasionally split the quiet; magical humming, scurrying, or the squeaks and snarls of the tiny Ether inhabitants which mostly chose to remain hidden in the presence of the dragon and his beautiful escort.

They were, however, momentarily swarmed by a cloud of tiny yellow and red flies; so small only his dragon's instinctual knowledge allowed him to identify the insets. Chris held Annabel close as the collective examined the newcomers, eventually moving off once its curiosity was satisfied and they were identified as something other than food.

"How do they all live here if we never see anything like this in the normal world?" Annabel asked as the swarm buzzed way.

"These are purely inhabitants of the Ether, they feed off the energy we all leak through into this dimension. It's not much but it adds up." Chris explained to the best of his understanding as they passed a magical storefront, its shadow form practically glowing.

Several healthy looking vines grew across the window, basking in the radiant energy whilst something resembling a small rodent was poking its snout from its burrow near the doorway.

"Do they ever cross back over into our world?"

"I don't know. Perhaps, but I imagine that it would cost them a lot of energy and I don't know if any of them are intelligent enough or have control over magic. Everything we've seen so far has been of animal intelligence at most, I think. Susan says there are more malevolent things lurking in the Either, the husks of people who have been trapped and even things from dimensions we don't know about."

"How can that be right? How many other worlds are there?"

He pulled her close against his side as they walked, trying to explain his own philosophy about these questions; questions he'd mostly tried to not let bother him as his human life played out, waiting for his awakening.

"There's no way of knowing, Annabel. I try not to think about it too hard, their inaccessibility makes them pretty much irrelevant. When Susan first told me, I couldn't wrap my head around it either but she said that incursions between worlds are pretty much legends these days. The last major event happened many thousands of years ago, a huge battle between two powerful races spilled over into our world. There was no magic back then but that changed pretty quickly as they fought each other and even converted us to fight on their behalf. The Devines won, but were horrified how much they'd changed our world, how much magic was left behind. They placed a barrier on our dimension so that hopefully we would be free to continue on without any more interference. At least that's how the story goes."

"So even Beings don't know for sure?" Annabel felt a little better that she wasn't the only one but it still left her without an answer to the apparent existence of other dimensions, worlds, and sentient beings.

"No, I can't say that story is at all accurate but it's what we've got. Apparently it's passed down from the first Beings, the ones who fought in those battles."

"Hmm," Annabel thought it over as they continued walking a little way. It was certainly a long shot from the creation story she'd grown up with. They'd walked several blocks now and she felt that they had had enough adventure for one night.

"We should head back," she murmured.

"Yeah, Lillian will be pissed if she wakes up and we're missing."

"Thanks for pushing me to come, Chris. It was a bit scary but I want to be involved in what you do," Annabel squeezed the hand she'd captured as they started back.

"Thanks, Dee."

They took a different way back, completing a loop, walking mostly in silence, happy to be alone in each other's presence and soak up the other-worldly atmosphere.

With the hotel lobby in sight, a loud growl and a high pitched squeak issuing from a nearby building caused them to pause.

A blue steak shot out onto the ghostly pavement and attempted to escape up the street in a flutter of tiny wings. However, a much larger creature, about the size of a large dog, merged from the shadows with lightning speed and pinned it easily.

Chris and Annabel looked on in shock as the larger chimera-like creature played with its prey. It was hard to describe, but it clearly had dexterous forelimbs, a long blade-tipped tail, and a maw of sharp teeth. The hapless morsel screamed piteously, sparking Annabel's reaction.

"Do something, Chris! Help it!"

"I don't-," He barely started, not sure if it was right to intervene. Annabel made the decision for him however, pushing him forwards. "Fine. Hey, Hey! Shoo! Fuck off! Grrrrrrr!"

He advanced on the creature, hoping his flailing arms and exclamations would be enough to startle it. All it did was turn towards him with a warning snarl, its prey still helplessly trapped under claw against the concrete.

It did look quite ferocious and Chris was at a loss momentarily until his dragon provided the answer, unleashing a bellowing roar from his mouth directly towards the predator.

It didn't even look back, streaking off through the shadows with a hiss, yielding its morsel to the mightier Ether beast. Annabel shot forwards past Chris, kneeling quickly to rescue the blue streak.

"Oh my God, Chris, it's a tiny person!" She cried over her shoulder.

"Wait, what?" he asked, coming to look.

"A tiny blue person, with wings."

Annabel was indeed correct, the tiny blue woman, barely more than a foot from head to toe looked up at them in shock. She was completely anatomically correct, having the slim, tall build of an elf with proportional bat-like wings and conspicuously long pointy ears. Her rich, slightly wavy hair hung bedraggled around her body to her waist, concealing her in a blue so deep it was almost black.

"She's hurt Chris, look at her broken wing and the cuts across her thighs. Can't you help her?" Annabel pleaded, scooping the miniature woman up in her hands.

"Annabel, I think that's a sprite. I don't know how to help her and they're not always trustworthy or even good natured at all. They're intelligent and mischievous. She can understand us and is probably perfectly capable of helping herself."

Susan had mentioned sprites as one of the more problematic denizens of the Ether or whichever realm they chose to frequent.

"Please, Chris, can't you just use your saliva on her wounds? She's bleeding."

He sighed, knowing it was useless to protest. Besides, if the sprite was actually bleeding he could at least seal the wounds.

"Okay, pass her to me, gently."

The handoff went smoothly, only a few high pitched whimpers escaping the sprite. Soon she was sitting on his palm, bedraggled but with an air of maintained composure belying her drooping, broken wing. Chris brought her close to his face so they were eye to eye, helplessly noticing her perfectly proportional assets and even a tiny triangle of blue hair at her crotch. She was indeed a miniature beauty.

"I'm going to try to heal you now, okay? But I want your word that you won't try to cause trouble first."

He thought he saw a weak smile play across her face before she gave a nod.

Annabel watched on in awe as Chris closed the gap, lapping out across the sprite's thighs, across her navel, and up her chest, clearing the abrasions and deep cuts left by her encounter with the beast.

The wounds were tiny, but on someone her size, Chris could only assume that they were actually quite serious and certainly very painful. Her taste was pure sweetness, combined with an almost almond-like creaminess. Even her drying blood tasted delicious. He looked up when he was done with her front to see a surprised look on her elegant face, almost like she had rather expected him to eat her whole instead.

Turning her onto her belly with a finger, he licked as gently as possible across the broken forewing emerging from her shoulder, the leathery membrane quivering as she cried out in pain despite his care. She lay still for a moment, whimpering as the bone seemed to remesh in the correct position, a dragon's saliva proving to be highly potent on such a small patient. She appeared to have passed out from pain.

He tried to remember what Susan had told him about sprites but couldn't come up with much other than that they were very rare in modern times, that and they were always hungry. His dragon agreed, suggesting he feed her some energy. Sprites have such fast metabolisms that they were always at the brink of starvation.

"What are you doing now?" Annabel asked as Chris took on a very serious look, concentrating on the opposite hand to the one the sprite lay on. A spark slowly grew between his thumb and forefinger.

"Making it some food," he answered, pulling energy from himself and the Ether surrounding them into a perfect, purple cube about the size of a medium dice.

"She eats that? What is it?"

"It's raw magical energy. A tiny amount for me, what's actually difficult is putting it in a form which is stable and solid like this. This cube would probably be considered a high explosive. It's quite inefficient to make but my dragon is helping me."

He took the cube and ran it under the sprite's minute nose almost teasingly. The reaction was nigh instantaneous, her eyes fluttered for a second before her hands, suddenly tipped with nasty, retractable little talons, shot out and ripped the cube from his loose grip.

Her extended fangs glistened as she sunk her teeth deep and let out a moan, proceeding to devour the cube with disregard for her surroundings. It was as if the only thing in the world that mattered was stuffing her little face. It took her about a minute and by the end, her belly was swollen as if she was at half term.

Looking up at him with an appraising head cock, the sprite finally spoke.

"Thank you, dragon, I accept. I must rest now."

Without further discussion, she turned over to drape herself across his palm and wrist in a foetal position.

No amount of gentle prodding would rouse her. What did she mean by accepting?

"She's so cute!" Annabel excited.

Chris wasn't so optimistic. Sure, the sprite was cute, but he couldn't help but feel it probably wasn't the best of ideas to feed the wild animals.

Unwilling to just leave her in the open, Annabel insisted that they take her back to their apartment, at least until she recovered.

"She's not just a bird with a broken wing, Annabel. Sprites aren't really considered full Beings but she's a person, not a pet."

--------------------------------------------
"I can see that, Chris. Don't you think, though, that leaving her on the street would be dangerous with that thing lurking around? Besides, she'll be grateful for our help and maybe you'll have a friend to talk to when you come to the Ether at night."

"I hadn't thought about that last bit," Chris considered. It was true though, the sprite could probably teach him a lot, if she was so inclined.

"It's settled then," Annabel said with an air of finality.

They carried the tiny creature back to the apartment uneventfully, tucking the comatose sprite into some of Annabel's clothes in the wardrobe of their bedroom. Chris kept his reservations to himself for the moment, he would ask Lillian what to do about it in the fast approaching morning.

The couple ended up cuddling on the bed as Chris merged them back into the Norm. Annabel felt textures return to normal as regular colours bloomed back into existence across her vision.

Despite her initial reluctance, she was invigorated by their jaunt into the night. She was learning so much about this new world and even better, she was by his side as he learned. It only reaffirmed her desire to embrace everything she was confronted with and support him, rather than hold him back.

"Petra Godran called last night. She and Claire, her daughter, are driving up from California tomorrow to meet me," Chris admitted as he thought back to his conversation with the dragoness the evening before.

"So soon?" Annabel hugged him tightly, a frown concealed against his shoulder as she took a deep breath of the scent she'd become so used to calling her own.

"I know, I was surprised too... Annabel, if Claire and I do mate, we'll form a very strong bond. That can't be avoided, especially if we're as compatible as Elizabeth seems to think. I just... I love you and I always will, you are my First and I promise to never forget that or neglect you. If you have a problem, please talk to me."

"I know that, silly. It's just all happening so fast. I see the way women look at you and I know firsthand how easy you are to fall in love with. You told me from the start there would be other women in your life and that you'd be mating with other dragons. That's fine, nothing's changed for me so long as I'm still your girlfriend, someday your wife, and hopefully your favourite. I love you so much, Chris."

"Yes. Yes to everything. I'll never understand how lucky I was to find you, Dee," he whispered into her hair as they began to gradually relax, eventually getting a few more hours of delicious sleep in each other's arms before Chris's early morning start.

***

"I'm driving back to Laramie tomorrow afternoon. Petra called last night and arranged for us to meet tomorrow, I thought it might be better to do that at home," Chris announced at breakfast, they were sitting around the kitchen's central island again.

Annabel already knew but Susan's head shot up in surprise and Michelle gave him a questioning look as she finished her mouthful of cereal.

If Lillian had a reaction at all, it was invisible, as she was in the living room.

"Who's that?" Michelle asked.

"They're two female dragons, mother and daughter, who have been assigned to watch over him, seeing how young he is, and mate with him if they're compatible," Susan explained once she recovered.

"So what? It's like an arranged marriage?" Michelle clarified.

"Sort of, except that the only pressure to go through with it is saving our species," replied Chris. "Nothing will happen unless sparks fly though."

"So who's coming with us back to Laramie, we'll need to leave around two in the afternoon tomorrow?" Annabel asked, beginning to clear some dishes into the sink.

"You're going along?" Michelle was incredulous yet again at the young woman's elasticity when it came to the sexual exploits of her boyfriend. Annabel nodded. "Well I can't, I've got to stay and help out here with the Synod. Am I allowed to be alone?"

"Yes Michelle, but I'll get Tim to have someone assigned to look after you while we're gone," said Lillian from her favourite armchair.

"Rowan will be fine without me for a day or two, besides I do need to check on my plants back at home. Jethry has his heart in the right place but he's no green-thumb," Susan reasoned. Really, she wouldn't let another set of women move in on her son without making sure they were suitable.

"Okay, now that that's out of the way... Last night, Annabel and I rescued a sprite in the Ether. She's in our room, still asleep at last check."

"What?! Chris, I warned you about this kind of thing. Sprites are notoriously fickle and can be very dangerous when they set their mind to it." Susan scolded her son, although she knew it was his nature to protect things where he could. Given recent events, she hoped he wouldn't take any unnecessary risks.

"Where did you find her?" Lillian asked nonchalantly, stalking from the next room, towards the dragon.

"Out on the other side of the block," he admitted, flinching as he felt the invisible vampire approaching him from behind. He jumped when her hands ghosted up his arms and settled on his shoulders with undead strength.

"Disobey me again, little dragon, I dare you," whispered Lillian directly in his ear.

Chris shivered, she'd meant to scare him but anything Lillian whispered in his ear could only be exciting.

"What's a sprite?" asked Michelle, unintentionally easing the tension.

"You would probably know of them as pixies or fairies. They're definitely not all rainbows and granted wishes though. They have retreated from our dimension over the last three millennia after losing their war and as humans grew more prevalent. They're very rare these days and quite powerful if they can focus their minds to magic for more than five seconds. I'm ashamed to say that there have been sales of captured sprites in the past to be used as ingredients in powerful spells."

Susan gave the textbook explanation to the ex NSA agent, who was actually learning to take knowledge bombs like this in stride.

"She's okay though, the sprite?" Susan looked towards her son. "I can't recall hearing about any sprite females recently."

"We think so," Annabel answered for him. "She passed out after Chris healed her and we didn't want to leave her in the open with that thing that was chasing her around. It almost killed her."

"What thing?" Lillian's fingers twitched in annoyance against his t-shirt before she stood back and released him.

Annabel proceeded to describe the entire event in detail, painting Chris the initially reluctant but ultimately valiant hero who rescued the small damsel from the jaws of an inter-dimensional, flesh hungry predator.... "then he fed her a magic sugar cube and she pigged out and went to sleep."

"Sounds like a young wraith," Lillian mused, thinking about the predator. They were mostly harmless when they were that small, the older ones were problematic for Ether mages though.

"Did you have to go and feed her, Chris? She's going to stick around now that she knows you can give her magic-rich sustenance," Susan wasn't sold on the idea of a sprite in the house.

"She could help Chris learn about the Ether though," Annabel pointed out yet again as she picked out a banana for herself now that the dishes were mostly cleared away. "She'd at least be someone for him to talk to when he's in there alone at night."

"It's a risk, Annabel, and you might not be so friendly if she decides she likes him and sets her sights on Chris," Susan countered.

Annabel's eyebrows rose in shock quickly and a blush just barely started showing itself before she recovered.

"That's impossible. She's so tiny."

"None of that matters right now," Chris didn't want the conversation travelling any further down that avenue. "We should at least wait until she wakes up before passing judgement. She'll probably just go on her way. Besides, I've got to keep an eye on all of you without a sprite to worry about. Speaking of which, or should I say witch, what are you ladies doing today?"

"Ug, you're the worst," Michelle groaned. "I'm in a conference with a few of the Synod and some legislation experts in DC."

"I'll be at the apothecary, Rowan is showing me his potion recipe for light numbing and anaesthesia. Apparently it's been passed down since the seventeen hundreds," Susan was obviously enthusiastic about her new job under the aging magician.

"I'm going to scope out the school and ask some of the staff if there are any good restaurants to apply to for part time work at while I'm here," Annabel answered.

"And what are we doing, Lillian?" Chris asked.

"Training, then we'll go see Reyla when she's ready," replied Lillian coolly, still a bit miffed that he'd flouted her order to stay in the apartment during his jaunts into the Ether.

"What does she want?" asked Chris.

"Your tutor arrived last night."

***

Chris had been expecting an elf, Reyla said that he was her cousin, although she seemed to attach quite a lot of distain to admitting that. What he hadn't expected was a brown elf.

So when he hobbled his way into Reyla's darkened study, still sore from his recent punishment at the hands of the beautiful vampire; he was surprised to see a slender, long eared fellow with a quick smile and smooth, chocolaty skin. He didn't have much to compare to but it seemed strange to see an elf in jeans, a t-shirt, and even a pair of worn sneakers.

"Christopher, this is my cousin, Arvil, who I have attained at no small expense to teach you the ways of the Ether and instruct you in magic more generally."

Reyla introduced the two from her position in the largest, most comfortable chair in her dim study. She watched the dragon as he started forward, offering his hand. He seemed to be becoming more confident and purposeful each time she saw him. <em>Oh how he'd put the Synod in their place, bunch of self-righteous fools that they were most of the time.</em> She would remember the dragon's little outburst fondly for years to come, so would the Synod, though not with the same humorous outlook.

"Hello, Arvil, it's nice to meet you, and just Chris is fine."

"Well met, Chris. And may I say that it is an honour to be entrusted with your education," Arvil replied in his smooth, deep voice, accepting the firm handshake and examining the man before him with both physical and magical senses. "I didn't believe Reyla when she contacted me but it's really true; you are a dragon and the Ether is woven intricately into your being. A singularity. Astounding."

"I can't say I've ever heard of a brown elf myself so perhaps we have something in common?" replied Chris.

Arvil burst into laughter.

Chris looked around, noticing that Reyla looked even haughtier and more cross than usual.

"I don't get it."

"My boy, I have a feeling we will get along swimmingly."

Anyone who brazenly raised the subject of his heritage in front of another elf was a good sort in Arvil's books. He even took pleasure from watching other elves discomfort with his skin colour.

"He is the bastard progeny of forbidden love between Drow and High Elf," Reyla said with disgust dripping from her lips as she lent forwards. "A reminder to both that we are not the distinct species we would like believe we are. Because of that, he's hated and shunned by all. Although, I admit, he has his uses."

"That's terrible," Chris murmured, looking back to Lillian to confirm that it was actually true. The vampire gave him a nod.

"I accepted my lot a long ago, Chris," said Arvil. "Now tell me about yourself. My cousin says you have quite the tale and have been even busier since she met you."

Chris quickly recapped his story since his awakening, mostly leaving out his life in hiding with Susan.

"And there weren't any hints as to your powers before you awoke?"

"Well, I could always hear and smell better than normal. There was the thing with the gold, too, but I didn't know about that. That's all to do with my dragon though. As far as the Ether, I used to dream about it or in it, I'm not entirely sure. I guess that was a pretty big hint but neither Susan nor I realised what it meant."

"Excellent!" Arvil exclaimed suddenly, as if startling himself from deep thought. Chris got the impression from his mannerisms that Arvil was either a little peculiar or he hadn't had much contact with humans in the past hundred or so years. "You can already phase and manipulate Ether energy, that shows you have raw talent, your dragon's instincts are guiding you well. I would like to see you in action as soon as possible. Perhaps tomorrow afternoon, once I get my affairs in order?"

"I ah... Tomorrow afternoon wouldn't be the best, I'm meeting some other dragons," Chris glanced sidelong at Reyla, wondering if she would be upset in any way.

"You needn't try to hide it from me, Christopher," Reyla smiled with false sweetness. "Petra Godran called me this morning to arrange travel permits and accommodation for her stay. I know all about your plan for a country tryst."

Chris couldn't help but blush.

<a>"So, you've been paired with the Godran's? Haha! Lucky boy. I've heard their beauty rivals even that </a>of my beloved cousin here," Arvil spoke with an elaborate twirl of his hand towards Reyla. Lillian couldn't help but snigger, earning her a warning glare from the Drow.

"How about this evening then, Chris? I'd like to assess your ability and knowledge as soon as possible in order to come up with a teaching strategy. We could even just take a stroll through the Ether so that I can see you in your element, so to speak."

"He's already been quite exploratory," Lillian added, taking the chance to remind Chris of his recent transgression. "Last night he and his familiar waltzed around our district's streets, out and about on their own and even rescued a sprite girl form a young wraith. They ended up bringing the poor thing home with them like it's a pet."

Chris shot daggers at Lillian, one for ratting him out to Reyla; and two for painting the incident in completely the wrong light. He didn't get a chance to defend himself, though, because both elves were staring at him and Reyla had shot out of her seat.

"A sprite? Small, with bat-like wings and elven features? A woman?!" Reyla asked disbelievingly, cursing herself for not monitoring her surveillance equipment more closely.

It shocked her because although it wasn't common knowledge, what few sprite females there were left alive and "free" were kept and guarded in their last remaining stronghold; a mystical city in the branches and heart a giant oak somewhere deep in Europe. Only none knew exactly where it was, because the tree uprooted itself every night and walked to a new location.

"She let you touch her?" Arvil asked.

"Well, she was injured with a broken wing, I only used my saliva to heal her," Chris countered, not knowing why everyone was apparently upset with him.

"It must have been drawn to his presence," mused Arvil with a thoughtful scratch of his head.

"I must talk to her, where is she now?" Reyla continued, her hackles raised at the thought of another potentially very manipulative force setting its sights on her pet project.

Chris gave Lillian a questioning look but it was only bounced back at him, with added confusion.

"She passed out after I healed her and gave her some food, we took her back..." Chris tried to reply levelly.

"You fed her?!"

"What?" Chris asked, "Yeah, I guess. Who cares?! Why is this a big deal all of a sudden?"

"Incorrigible, even for a male dragon," Reyla murmured, ignoring him completely. "There's something about him cousin, just you wait and see."

"Only one way to find out if she did or not," replied Arvil as if they were completing each other's thoughts.

"Yes," Reyla said, finally looking Chris in the eye. "Picture the sprite woman with your mind's eye. Gather a little energy, not too much mind, and say, 'come to me.' Can you do that, dragon?"

"What the fuck is going on?" Chris was about to lose his cool if someone didn't answer soon.

"Just do it. It will answer your question," Reyla snapped.

Chris exhaled loudly, taking another calming breath before relenting. He hated when people wouldn't just take a few moments to explain things. His eyes closed, he thought of the tiny woman. Her blue skin, her cute little ears, her small wings, her perfectly proportioned miniature body, her surprised, thankful eyes.

"Come to me."

A tiny pop echoed in the silence of collective anticipation. He felt the release of energy, followed by a quiet whirr, perhaps of tiny wings. Chris didn't dare open his eyes for a few seconds, but eventually he cracked one eyelid cautiously to find his fears realized.

"Hello, Master," squeaked the beautiful sprite, hovering a few feet in front of him at eye level. She looked at him curiously before stretching and yawning. "I'm still tired, may I land on you?"

Chris automatically extended his hand toward the sprite, palm up. She alighted gracefully, sitting naked with her legs dangling over the edge of his hand as her wings daintily folded shut.

"Master?" he asked.

"Yes. You fed me from your hand and I accept, you will be my Master for one hundred years."

"As I suspected," Reyla hissed. "You sought him out you little trollop, tricked him into offering you food. I would have warded him a thousand times had I known you were skulking in my territory."

"I did no such thing," the sprite replied with a lot of backbone for someone so small. "I just about died, if he wasn't there I would have been eaten by a wraith. He offered it to me freely, even if he didn't know what he was doing. It's your own fault besides, had your race helped us ages ago, we would still be considered true Beings and I would have had to announce my presence to you."

The others looked on, following the conversation but having nothing to add or in the case of Chris, being too caught up in his internal argument.

<em>You knew, you knew this would happen?</em> he accused.

<em>It was a possibility</em>, replied the dragon calmly.

<em>Why?</em>

<em>She could be a useful ally, she is fun, and she is very lonely</em>.

<em>I give up.</em>

Reyla's eyes flashed as she cocked her elegant neck and examined the latest pain in her ass. Something seemed familiar about this little elfkin but it was so long since she'd visited their court, ancient history before their species was all but destroyed by that fateful war. It mattered not as her legendary temper began to bubble.

"I should put you in a glass jar and feed you to a spider. How dare you enter my territory and bind yourself to him!" She spat, her dark rage definitely getting the better of her. She was sick of others putting their marks on him when she could do nothing of her own.

"You hold no claim on him Dark One! And if you did that, he would see you for the sour, mean, old bat that you truly are!" snarled the sprite in return, hitting the mark. She knew enough about Reyla Narlakis to strike true.

That did it.

Reyla had had a stressful week, getting sassed by a sprite was the final straw in her murky mind. Before thinking about it, a bolt of shade-frost shot from her finger, streaking towards the pest in a gaudy display of blues and unnaturally cast darkness, like the contact of an arc-welder.

The dragon's reaction, for Chris wasn't really involved, was instantaneous, spinning so his back intercepted the spell, sending him flying across the room to topple into a low bookshelf with the sprite held against his chest.

He slumped for a moment before his body began the rapid transformation to his half form, his wings exploding out of his t-shirt as a bestial snarl left his throat.

Reyla looked at her hand in shock, a grey, ghostly afterimage of her spell still dissipating from her outstretched finger. She never considering that the dragon would risk his life to protect the little sprite.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
The sprite could probably have flicked aside the spell, having innate resistance to most magics. She didn't get a chance, though, as the dragon crushed her to his chest. She smiled happily, swooning, melting, she knew she'd made the right choice with the dragon.

Chris couldn't believe it, once he'd gained his breath back, he rose quickly and strode forwards.

Lillian, so used to protecting the elf, stepped into his way. He stopped close, their bodies almost touching, and stared deeply into her eyes for a moment as if their souls were talking.

To even her own surprise, she stepped aside after mere seconds of his baleful gaze, unconsciously admitting her submission to the dragon. Her whole body buzzed with a potent cocktail of excitement, fear, and lust as he brushed past her, that damnable scent clouding her mind.

Chris stopped a few feet from the elf, his entire body felt shivery and weak, frost burn radiating across his skin.

Reyla didn't acknowledge him or the tiny woman he clutched protectively. Her head was lowered, watching the floor, considering her rash action.

Pride and shame held her tongue, giving him a moment to compose his thoughts.

He took a deep breath, surprisingly calm given the amount of adrenaline and pain that was flooding his system. He was pretty sure his back had a chunk missing from it. By rights, he had the justification to end her, or at least try. There was no desire to do that though.

"I forgive you, Reyla. But I fear for us all if Beings as powerful as you are so arrogant they would take a life over a few words. Are you that hateful? That petty? How are we going to live with humans if we can't even control ourselves?"

Turning to Arvil, who was still gawking at dragon's half form and seemed rather nonchalant about all the growling and spell-slinging, the dragon managed a pained grimace.

"Maybe it's best if we wait a few days until things quieten down."

"Yes, of course," the elf grinned.

With that Chris turned and walked out, exposing the open burn on his back with blackened, vine-like tendrils snaking across his purple skin where it was visible through the tatters of his shirt.

He walked silently, straight back to the hotel through the underground passageways, holding the nervous yet jubilant sprite while the vampire followed along behind. People stared at his half form openly, gasping and pointing if they got a peak at his gruesome wound.

He didn't care at that point.

"I'm sorry," whispered Reyla, long after he'd gone.

"Oh hush, cousin. You haven't insulted him beyond repair else he would have tried to kill you," Arvil consoled. "You have bigger concerns perhaps, your vampire is no longer the loyal lapdog you once bragged to me about."

Reyla hardly registered that someone was speaking, aching inside as much as the dragon probably ached without. His words, so insignificant but without any shield or counter spell to stop them, had hit home. She felt small, wretched; a little girl again being scolded for maiming one of her playmates. Worst of all, she'd exposed her true, darker nature to him. She hated that nature, her darkness, her inner rage. Over the centuries, she'd grown to accept it as part of herself. It drove her to greatness but left something missing inside her. Perhaps she was broken.

Those thoughts made her feel anger in turn, for was she not a powerful sorceress, thousands of years old? What should she care of this new-born dragon whelp?

She sighed with a heavy breath. He was right, of course. Curse his good-smelling innocence. It was his damn fault she had trouble controlling herself around him, not her own.

***

"Oohhff."

Chris slumped onto the bed, dumping the sprite on the pillow next to his head so he could see her. He managed to pull the comforter partly over his shivering bulk as she righted herself, kneeling with her legs tucked underneath her tiny but perfectly sculpted butt.

"What is your name, little one?" the dragon asked.

"Immianthe. I'm sorry, Master, I shouldn't have provoked her like that but we have history," apologised the sprite.

"Perhaps not. My name is Chris by the way, none of this master business. Now, would you mind explaining what exactly you're playing at?"

"Chris," she rolled his name on her tongue. It seemed somehow inappropriate to use his name but it was an intimate gesture to allow her the privilege. "Fine, then you may call me Immi. You saved me from the wraith and healed me, showing far more kindness than I have grown to expect from Beings. When you fed me, I took the opportunity to bind myself. I am not playing at anything."

"Why though?" Chris asked. "Why be bound to anyone at all?"

"I have had a difficult life away from my people, Chris. I'm a runaway from a poor match selected by my father to further his relationship with the high elves. He was desperate to insure an alliance for the survivors of our race and was ready to sacrifice me as the price. I know it's usually the duty of a princess to serve for the good of her people but I just couldn't do it. I never would have survived my husband, he was well known to be cruel and manipulative, so I fled. I think it was the best course of action, for had I gone through with it, he would have used my continued wellbeing against my father. I've been scavenging to survive for the last twenty years, hiding in the Ether. When you and your mate healed and fed me, I knew it was time to come in from the cold, I'd found someone to live with who would be kind and gentle. Who'd respect me as a living Being rather than an object or trinket. I have felt a pull to come here over the past days despite the dangers of more populated areas, now I think I was drawn to you, Chris."

"I don't know what to say," Chris was tormented by her story, never imagining the complexities this new world contained compared to his previously simplistic life. To trade a daughter against her will like some sort of livestock, incomprehensible.

"It is the past, say nothing," She spoke softly.

That only worked for a moment as he watched her.

"So, you're a princess?" He asked with a sly smile.

The sprite nodded.

"I used to be at least. I suspect father exiled or stripped me of my title when I escaped though."

"It was the food that sealed the deal though, wasn't it? I've heard about sprites." Chris managed with a weak chuckle.

"Yes, the food may have played a part," Immi smiled back with a tiny wink, moving to lie on her tummy as she stared up at the half of his face not pressed into the bedding. "We sprites only have a reputation for being so voracious because we hale from a time long ago when magic was so plentiful <a>that what we required to feed ourselves was relatively a mere pittance. The word has changed much </a>since then and now we are considered not much more than greedy pests, a plague if our numbers ever grew to what they used to be before the war. This world's magic is so weakened, dragon. You are too young to see it but if you live a thousand years, you will begin to feel it in your bones, as we sprites do."

"A war? That's the second time you've mentioned it."

"It's ancient history, do not trouble yourself, Chris," She clearly didn't want to discuss it further.

"Hmm, I would be interested in you telling me one day. In the meantime, would you like some more, Immi?" Chris asked, it seemed wrong that this beautiful, playful little Being possessed knowledge so profound and ancient. Both he and his dragon were interested in learning more from her.

"Of course, Master!" the sprite chirped merrily. "Always."

Chris brought his hand up and began forming a little spark. It was easier this time, in his half form, but he didn't have the Ether's energy to draw from directly, plus he was wounded. The result was a slightly smaller cube of stable, purple-grey energy.

She didn't snatch or scrabble at it this time, rather moving to lay across his hand and nibble as they continued talking. She broke little chunks from the corners and brought them to her lips like freshly baked bread.

"This is the best I've ever tasted. You'll never understand how much this means to a sprite, hunger is always building inside us in these times of famine; to the point where we would eat nasty, disgusting things quite happily. It doesn't take too much energy from you, does it? How badly are you hurt?"

"No, it's fine and I will be too, I think. I'm really cold and sore is all."

He watched her eat daintily before her nudity became too much to go unchecked.

"Immi, don't you have any clothes, I mean, are you always naked?" he asked, feeling her breasts being pushed into his fingers where she lay.

"Of course," she giggled, tearing off another little chunk of magic and popping it into her mouth with obvious relish. It tasted like the spiced, creamy candy she'd loved when she was much, much younger.

"It's a little distracting."

"You'll get used to it, you can touch if you want. You are my Master after all."

It was practically a purr from her tiny mouth but he ignored her seductive tones.

"What do you want, Immi? What do I do with you? I've got a lot going on in my life right now and it wasn't cool to just bind yourself to me. Isn't there a way to undo it?"

"You don't want me," she murmured, turning her body away from his view. Her wings and shoulders began to tremble.

"Jesus," Chris muttered, there had to be some serous bad Karma for making a sprite princess cry. "I didn't mean it like that, Immi, I just don't know what I'm doing. I've barely been awakened for two weeks and I know almost nothing about sprites, magic, or anything else in this screwed-up world. Okay? I'm sorry for being untactful but... ah fuck it all..."

"I could teach you," she spoke softly over her shoulder. "Most Beings would be honoured to have a sprite princess bind themselves to them, even if I am only seventh in line. Females are very uncommon after the war, let alone royal females."

"It's not like that, Immi, I just don't know you. You don't even know me."

"I know enough to know that I'll be happy with you. And I know I can make you happy in return, if you let me."

She turned back to him now, entreating him, exposing her blue bosom with her darker hair flowing down across her perfect curves.

"Please, all I want is your kindness, your touch, and friendship, perhaps your love, in time." Her heartfelt plea tugged at his heartstrings.

Chris sighed, she looked so hopeful. How could he say no to that? His dragon certainly couldn't.

"Okay Immi, you can stick around."

"Good!" she laughed, crocodile tears quickly forgotten. "Because I wouldn't have taken no for an answer."

With that, she fluttered into the air, still clutching the last of her food, and landed in his purple hair. She tumbled around happily for a few moments before sitting up.

"You've made me very happy already, dragon."

"Great, another beautiful woman to satisfy," Chris groaned.

"Ohh, I'll get to watch you rut with them all. How exciting! Look at the size of you though, I wish you were smaller," she teased, pulling playfully at tufts of his hair.

The dragon's throat rumbled grumpily.

"Cheer up, I'm easy to please."

"You're going to be trouble, aren't you?"

"Of course, Chris. I'm a sprite after all." She leaned down and whispered right into his ear, "You can always punish me if I go too far... Master."

A shiver which had nothing to do with his recent encounter with frost magic spiralled down Chris's spine all the way to his toes.

Lillian interrupted them then, clearing her throat from the doorway.

"Reyla just sent this salve over, it's supposed to help counteract the burn."

The vampire didn't think much of the sprite flouncing around in her dragon's hair, lounging on the back of his neck. Honestly, she was still shaken by her encounter with him. One soulful look, his warmth so close, his breath arose her lips; she'd rolled over in submission under mere seconds of his commanding gaze.

Her treacherous body still shook with tremors of arousal while her vampire keened to run to him and gorge herself. Meanwhile, her human mind cursed herself for behaving like a hopeful little bitch around the dragon. Completely unprofessional. She expected to receive an angry summons from Reyla at any moment. It was certainly a good thing the Drow was too caught up in her own encounter with the dragon to be directly angry with her.

Chris groaned as he rolled over to accept the small glass jar of ointment.

It smelled inoffensive enough, and looked like it was based of some sort of tallow, dyed green perhaps by its active ingredients. He scooped a little onto his finger but soon found, with a pained intake of breath, that he couldn't tend to the wound just below his wing attachment himself.

"Help him, pointy-mouth," Immianthe demanded, walking down across his ridge of larger spine-scales to inspect her Master's wound; sustained so bravely in her defence.

"Could you? Please, Lillian?" Chris asked hopefully.

"Oh, okay," Lillian started herself from reflection. She wasn't sure it was such a good idea to be touching him at all but she went about quickly scoping a glob onto her fingers and rubbing it mechanically over the blackened gash below his forewing. She herself had been hit with shade-frost once, the boy was being very stoic.

"Not so hard vampire, it's a wound, not a piece of steak to tenderise," the sprite scolded from the side-lines.

"Sorry," Lillian murmured, it'd been quite a while since she'd done anything like this, it didn't come naturally.

"It's fine. I think I can feel it working already, thanks, Lillian."

"More over here," Immi called.

"Shut up, or do it yourself, seeing as you're so attached to him," Lillian snapped back, more like her usual self. None the less, she gently rubbed some where the sprite had indicated. "I think I'm done now anyway. Annabel can do it again later but you won't take too long to heal."

"Thank you, Lillian," Chris sighed in relief as she retreated out the door and down the hall to her own room. "Are you always so confrontational, Immi?"

"I'm nice," protested the blue little beauty. "I'm just testing her."

"Well, would you stop, please? You're going to get me in even more trouble. Besides, Lillian isn't someone you want to be on the bad side of, she's been through a bit recently."

"She doesn't scare me."

Chris had to chuckle gently at that.

"No, Immi, I can tell not much scares you."

***

Chris took the rest of the afternoon to rest and heal; eventually moving out to the lounge couch and lying face down. He passed the time surfing Maginet and filling Immianthe in on human technology and the advances of the last several decades.

Being a step removed from Beings in that they generally didn't try to blend into the human community, the sprite had much to learn but was catching on quickly.

Chris was already beginning to feel his heart soften towards her, his dragon had been right, she was fun.

She was also very tactile, simply lying on him like a piece of furniture and flaunting her nakedness openly. Later in the afternoon she seemed to become even more touchy, sitting astride his wrist as he showed her how to use his tablet. Her almond scent was strong in the air and Chris could swear he felt her squishing her hot little sex into his skin.

Finally, she leaned right over his tablet to see the image on the huge screen, exposing her heart shaped ass with her tiny vagina peeking between her thighs, glistening wetly. She had indeed left a wet spot.

It was right in front of his face and before he knew it, the dragon had the slits of his flattened snout mere millimetres from her sex.

Feeling the hot breath of the beast on her little treasure, she looked back over her shoulder and giggled mischievously at him, seeing the fight going on inside his eyes.

Chris had to deploy all of his resolve not to brush across her perfect, pouting labia with his forked tongue.

"Go ahead, I'd love you to," Immi crooned, wiggling her tiny buttocks back and forth teasingly.

"Stop Immi, it's hard enough with you crawling all over me naked. Don't tease me. It's not practical whatsoever."

"Silly dragon. Yes, your manhood probably weighs more than I do but there are other ways we could please each other. If you get too wound up, you can always take it out on your other broodmates."

"So you want to be part of my brood as well?" growled the dragon.

"I ... Yes," the sprite said firmly. "Please Master, lick me. I'll go crazy if you don't, your damn scent is too hard to resist."

The dragon breathed hot across her nethers and finally she felt the tip of his forked tongue contact her. Immi let out a pleasured, high pitch squeak at the feel of his hot, soft tongue on her pussy. It had been so long.

She shoved back hard on all fours, pushing back until her blue ass slammed into his purple lips. His tongue snaked out, lapping all around and over her fevered labia, her thighs, and even her tiny puckered anus. His dexterous muscle was so big and provided so much stimulation she couldn't help but moan and grind herself into him as a fire built low in her belly and she flooded his probing tongue with her liquid joy.

The dragon couldn't get enough. Her tasty little cavern was exuding copious amounts of her creamy, sweet essence in tiny squirts matching the rhythmic contraction of her insides. The delicious flavour reminded Chris of the taste of almond nougat at Christmas. Her bouquet had some richer, salty, creamy undertones which he relished too and it seemed that as he truly set to the task of pleasuring his miniature concubine, his whole body began to feel strangely light and a sense of almost euphoric wellbeing settled in his mind.

Her moans indicated she was clearly loving his attention, making him smile, he enveloped half of her ass between his lips and sucked greedily as he sought her tiny blue clit indirectly with his tongue.

The reaction was instantaneous, she exploded violently in his mouth, screaming at the top of her tiny lungs.

"0oohhh! Fuck! Don't stop, Master, its good!"

She didn't stop either, continuing to caterwaul her happiness for half a minute as he lapped at her gushing sex. Had she been a full sized woman, he suspected she would have soaked both him and the couch.

The dragon couldn't help but chuckle inwardly, watching her body quake and her little wings flap and twitch as he overloaded the miniscule woman with pleasure.

Immianthe cursed her birth as a sprite once he finally released her from his mouth, collapsing down onto the couch cushion with her glistening ass pointed straight up in the dragon's face. She could barely breathe; her entire body was flushed, making her blue closer to the dragon's natural purple.

Through all this, the spasms of pleasure still wracked her tiny, foot-long frame, and all she could think was that if she was a regular sized woman, she could have him inside of her.

Something probed at her sex again, making her head shoot up in surprise, she was too sensitive right now. She couldn't, not again. Could she? The question died in her mind as this time, the dragon managed to part her labia and push one of the forks of his tongue inside of her.

"No! No, I can't it's too much!" she cried helplessly.

The massive beast growled his disapproval at that idea, ignoring her pleas, instead pushing deeper and wriggling his tongue so it lashed the walls of her over-pleasured, needy cunt. The sensation was so intense she instantly changed her opinion on the entire endeavour.

"Yes! Yes! Ravage me with your big tongue you magnificent beast. Don't ever stop!"

The dragon smiled in smug pride around her butt. Her praises fell into unintelligible cries and wails as he stuffed her insides full of his dextrous tongue.

--------------------------------------------
That was how Annabel found them, having come home and let herself in to the confusing sounds of high pitched sex. Initially she'd thought Chris must be watching porn in fast forward but the reality was even more absurd.

Sneaking forward, she peaked over the back of the couch, taking in the Dragon in his half form with a healing wound on his back and the tiny sprite backing herself up enthusiastically onto his mouth. It was quite the strange sight.

She knew she should be angry... she wasn't.

It was rather arousing as the seconds tricked by. She'd tried not to imagine what her dragon would look like with another woman, let alone one so unusual. And after all, Susan had tried to warn her but the reality in front of her was exciting. Bartholomew bounced excitedly across her skin, mirroring her emotions.

"You move very quickly, don't you?" Annabel interrupted.

The little blue woman started, looking up in shock with trembling wings and blurting out a slurred apology.

"I'm sorry Mistress, I should have asked permission but I just couldn't wait. I couldn't resist him. I'll... ooohh! I'll be done soon."

"I know that feeling," Annabel smirked sympathetically, crouching down at the end of the couch to observe closely, meeting eyes with the dragon to convey that she was okay. He soon went back to enjoying his little morsel wholeheartedly. It was quite hot watching him ravish the sprite, practically devouring her entire ass. "I guess that means you'll be staying with us?"

"Yesss! I'm his... oh god... I'm to be his pet for... unggnn... a hundred years!" Immianthe barely managed, trying to leverage herself back harder but having nothing to really grab onto.

Annabel recognised the tiny woman's dilemma, having encountered it a few times when Chris took her from behind and she wanted to match his powerful thrusts.

"Here you go," she extended her hand onto the couch in front of the sprite, offering her finger to push against. Annabel continued to surprise herself, perhaps she didn't even consider the sprite competition at all.

"Th..Th..Thank you Mistress," Immi grabbed hold of the offered finger and pushed back hard. "Yes, dragon! I'm cuming! Oh god, I'm cuming! I'm cuming!"

Her face distorted and her eyes squeezed shut; she tensed suddenly and tears began to seep at the corners. Then she was bucking and screaming in a language Annabel had never heard as she continued to rock back into Chris's mouth, fresh droplets of her joy misting fragrantly in the sex-filled air.

To the sprite, the exquisite battle between the dragon's hot tongue and her own quivering warmth was a writhing tornado of pleasure. Trapped deep inside her flooded womanhood, the storm's power consumed her body and mind, her everything. She'd never experienced anything even close to this.

Oh how right she'd been to choose him, muttering thanks to whatever force had driven her his way.

To the two observers, her pleasured mumbling might have seemed like nonsense; but the infatuated sprite wove powerful covenants of servitude and protection around her Master in an ancient, almost forgotten tongue. She would be his for far longer than a measly hundred years, even if he didn't know about it. The intensity of the sprite's orgasm was astonishing, triggering Annabel to action. Having watched him dismantle the tiny woman with nothing more than inhuman pleasure, she needed the dragon too.

As the sprite melted into a blissful mess on the cushion, Annabel stood and began stripping quickly. Her t-shirt and bra were lost in seconds. Her jeans took a bit longer after her shoes and socks came off. Her frilly black panties were already soaked through as she scrabbled to get them off and bend herself down onto the couch next to the sprite.

The dragon sensed a flare of power in the air as the sprite came but he was too absorbed with lapping greedily at her delicious cream as well as the spectacle of Annabel's wanton strip. His cock ached, throbbing and impatient in his ensnaring jeans. He knew exactly how he was going to ease that pain.

Annabel spread her legs and arched her back enticingly, watching the dragon eagerly struggle with his pants over her shoulder. Finally, his beautiful cock was exposed; its pointed, flared crown atop his long, creamy shaft. The slim line of purple along the underside, travelling down his thickness until it met those large, close-hanging purple testicles, so full of his pleasure inducing seed. On the couch next to her, Immianthe was equally entranced with the vision of manhood.

"You are a very luck woman, Mistress."

"My name's Annabel," she replied to the sprite as the dragon came to kneel behind her, positioning himself at her entrance but only giving himself kisses with her moist lips. It felt Iike he was scalding her, toying with her.

"I know I'm lucky but he can be a terrible tease sometimes. Like right now, he knows I need him inside so badly but he just insists on playing with me."

"He's just a big meany, gowley, dragon, we'll pay him back."

"Oh yes we will," Annabel agreed. "What's your name?"

"I'm Immianthe, thank you for saving me."

"You're welcome. Now, I'm going to enjoy finishing what you started."

Annabel arched her back sexily and pushed against the couch, feeling his thick crown spread her labia and slip inside. She looked back and entreated him, "Please baby, come on, don't... oohhoo!"

Her words died in her throat as he pushed forwards slowly.

Chris savoured her tender, precious gift inch by inch; pulling back slightly every now and then to relieve pressure on her taught, expanded opening. He continued resolutely until he felt her squishy limit against his sensitive cockhead.

He was so fucking thick and hard inside her. She swore, as she panted into the leather couch, that she could feel his rod throbbing angrily, deep in her stretched insides.

He growled lustily in pleasure, holding them still by her slim waist, letting her adjust. She was always so ready for him; so hot and restricting, her pussy was already starting to try to massage him. She was exquisite, and the dragon wondered why he ever bothered to do anything but ravish her continuously.

She moaned her desires as he leant down and feathered kisses across her shoulders and the back of her neck. There, a light sweat was starting to dew, full of her natural, sexy scent.

He turned her head and kissed her passionately, their tongues interlacing soon afterwards as Annabel tasted what she assumed was the sprite's delectable cum in his mouth. What a nasty, delicious cocktail it was, no wonder he'd been lapping at her like a madman.

The thought didn't even disturb her anymore, it set her on fire.

Releasing her lips, his hands brushed her ribs, around and across her smooth tummy and up to her small, perky tits, capturing and moulding them gently between his taloned fingers. Annabel could only pant and murmur in pleasure as the dragon took his time with her tingling body, holding himself deep inside her.

"That looks so hot," Immi breathed, feeling another flush of arousal sweep up her tired body. The purple and cream beast was mounted deeply inside his smaller mate. Her body, delicate and pale, compared to the larger, stronger male leaning down on top of her, teasing her nipples so cruelly.

The dragon started to thrust gently, withdrawing only a few inches and sliding them back inside her slowly. From her angle, Immi could see his erection as he pulled back, slick with his lover's juices.

She wanted that. Wanted it to be her cream wetting his glorious manhood. Alas, there was no way he could ever fit inside her tiny body.

"Chris, please go faster, I need it!" Annabel cried, feeling the burning heat start to mount in her loins as he sheathed himself slowly over and over. He would occasionally bump her cervix and send a jolt of pleasure up her body, drowning any accompanying pain.

She wanted him faster now, to feel his entire length moving inside her, filling her so completely.

"I can't, Annabel," Chris gritted his teeth as he kissed the back of her neck again, seeing her beautiful flush spreading slowly across her porcelain skin. "I'm too worked up from Immi, I'm already about to blow."

She giggled breathlessly, he was being over-attentive again; like he'd forgotten that as soon as his thick seed hit her insides she'd explode in shivering ecstasy.

"Then let it go, stupid, come in me! I want to feel it!"

"I love you, Dee," Chris whispered in her ear, taking her narrow waist between his hands, he thrust deeply, driving almost his full length inside her and pulling back for another stroke.

He looked down and was overcome by the image; her perfect ass offered up to him with his thickness slipping quickly inside. Her little yelp of pleasure and the feel of tight warmth around his cock before he was drawing back again, his shaft glistening with white streaks of her viscous, creamy lubricant. Her labia dragging back with his movement, clinging to him in an attempt to stop his escape.

It was too much, he growled low in his throat and began thrusting frantically, making her cry out as he raced towards his finish.

With a grunt, his cock swelled and began spurting heavily inside her, each release addling his brain with jolts of pleasure as he simply kept screwing her through their mutual orgasm.

Annabel moaned as she started to climax, her innermost depths instantly coated with his semen as her pussy squeezed him joyously. She contracted tightly with each thrust and jet of his throbbing cock, coaxing more and more from him as she bucked and cried encouragement beneath him. She could feel it, so hot and tingly as his magical stuff pooled against her cervix.

"Oh, fuck! That's too good, Chris! Give me all of it, don't let it stop!"

"Arrhh, Annabel," he moaned back, grinding his pulsing knob deep inside her quivering little pussy and relishing every last exquisite ejaculation until the was nothing left to give her. He was left tense and breathless above her, breathing the scent of their sex as she tortured his oversensitive helmet with her aftershocks.

Panting together, they calmed. Chris began kissing her back again, holding her close against him as she rode out little waves of pleasure.

He was still hard, so he continued his gentle thrusting, coaxing her to begin that delightful journey towards another climax.

Annabel complied willingly.

"Yeah, go again baby," she cooed happily, following her encouragement with moans and whimpers as he started to stroke deep. He let her fall onto the couch and leaned back to watch her ass shake and jiggle.

They continued working towards their goal for several minutes, increasing their pace slightly and egging each other on. He grabbed greedy handfuls of her exquisite butt as he became more and more excited, leaving light red claw marks on her perfect rump while she gasped in pleasure.

Immi could tell they were getting close again, the dragon's wings seemed to twitch when he was about to orgasm, just like hers did. She'd been masturbating furiously since watching them come together, the mighty dragon spending himself deep inside his mate.

A mischievous, dirty idea popped into her little head. It might overstep her bounds but she didn't care in her aroused state. The thought consumed her, she had to try.

With a weak flutter, she raised herself into the air and settled on the small of her Mistress' sweaty back, facing the dragon with her pussy rubbing into Annabel's hot skin. It was strange, she already felt a strong kinship to the human girl.

"Please."

Immi stared up at the dragon as he continued to thrust, that look of stupid pleasure right before going over the edge covering his purple, snarling face.

Annabel glanced behind to see the little blue sprite sitting on her back, watching Chris fuck her. She didn't care, she was too caught up in the feeling of his cock rubbing deep inside of her and the orgasm which was about to tear through her like wildfire, the little tattoo latched tenaciously onto her teat.

"What... do you ... want... little one?" The dragon asked between thrusts, smiling down at the adventurous sprite.

"You know what I want," Immi replied coyly, leaning forwards to watch the giant dragon pound his mate while her own slick fingers worked on herself.

He was so damn big compared to her.

The dragon grinned evilly, his fangs flashing down menacingly at Immianthe in obvious excitement.

"You're a dirty little sprite aren't you? Greedy too."

"Oh Yes!" Immi squealed from her perch as she frigged herself desperately towards completion. "I'm your dirty, greedy little sprite!"

"Fuck! Yes!" he roared.

Annabel wasn't paying too much attention to what was going on on her back, she'd reached her limit. At that moment, her orgasm struck, tensing her around Chris again and releasing a throaty, ragged moan. She could feel Bartholomew writhing in ecstasy in his favourite spot, wrapped around her belly button and giving her little love nips as she came.

Her molten heat was too much for him, triggering his climax in mere seconds as she milked his cock for her reward.

"Rrrraaaaghhh!" The dragon bellowed, holding himself deep inside Annabel as his first massive stream shot off, splattering her already sperm-coated insides yet again. He let himself have one more spurt inside his mate before quickly withdrawing and laying his sopping erection in the valley of Annabel's glorious ass, pointed directly at the astonished little sprite.

Immianthe barely had time to be amazed at his size before she watched in delight as a jet of hot, thick, dragon seed fired point blank into her soft belly. She screamed and squealed joyously as he gave her more and more, each ejaculation hitting her tiny body with force and buffeting her around a little. She was silenced as a huge droplet hit her face.

Her orgasm began with the most delicious taste in her mouth, her body tingling and buzzing with more energy than she had known in her life. She collapsed, a quivering mess of pleasure in a shallow pool of his white seed. Her limbs flailed gently and her wings spasmed, she lost her senses momentarily.

When they returned, she was gripped by her baser instincts, her claws and tiny fangs extended, brought to the fore by such a magic rich food all around her. Jolts of pleasure continued to flow through her as the dragon's cock dribbled its last into the little poolet on her Mistress's sweaty lower back.

She spared half a second to see the dragon smiling down at her debauchery before she began gorging herself and writhing around in his spend. Immi had another urge and quickly acted on it too, scooping several handfuls of his still-hot-spunk into her miniature pussy, crying out at the tingling pleasure it brought her.

Too soon, she was full to bursting, her belly swollen like a pregnant cow and his sticky, thick stuff cooling all over her skin and Annabel's back. She was absolutely covered in it, but eventually sat up and looked around, seeing that both the dragon and Annabel were watching her intently. She smiled back dirtily.

"What?"

"That was something else entirely," said Chris in awe of the scene. The sexy little woman rolling around in his spunk while beneath her, Annabel's pale back was splattered with thick, white ropes, some reaching all the way up past her shoulder blades.

"Hot. Nasty hot," Annabel confirmed, having turned to catch the tail end of the sprite writhing around on her back. "I'm sorry I missed the first half."

Immianthe twittered happily as Annabel reached back to gently grip her sticky body and bring her in front of her face.

"Welcome to the family, I guess. You're certainly a bundle of fun and that was pretty cool for my first threesome."

With that, Annabel gave the sprite a big, sloppy lick up her front, shivering in pleasure as she tasted her lover.

"Hey! That's stealing!" the sprite protested, batting against the other woman's huge lips.

"Threesome? More like two point one some," Chris chuckled, giving Annabel a playful swat across her lush, glistening ass, narrowly avoiding his softening member. "To the shower, both of you."

He harried the two beauties until they were all under the hot water. Backing Annabel into the wall, he gave her a searching kiss, even teasing her lips gently with his sharp teeth until they were swollen and she was left panting.

He turned to the soaked little sprite, perched on Annabel's shoulder, holding onto her hair. Leaning down to be eye to eye, the dragon assessed her seriously for a moment.

"That was wonderful Immi, I'd be honoured to call you one of my brood." He leaned forwards, despite the impracticality, and gave the little blue woman a kiss.

She returned it wholeheartedly, running her tongue across his much bigger bottom lip, even nipping him.

"Thank you, Master," Immi said as she slid down Annabel's breast and clawed her way up the dragon's scaled, creamy chest and into his wet hair, laying prone on top of his head to look down at the two lover's slick, sexy bodies. "And thank you too, Annabel, for sharing him with me."

"You're welcome, Immi. I never imagined I would do anything like that but in the end it kind of came naturally. Are you sure you'll be okay here though? I mean you cant... you know ... have sex with him."

"No, but that doesn't matter, I'm going to grow fat and happy off his seed. It'll be my time to spawn before I know it! Besides, your fingers look nice and dainty, you'll be good to me won't you, Mistress?"

Annabel giggled euphorically, unknowingly still affected by some of the sprite's magic as well as her dragon's pheromones. Would she be good to the little sprite? It might be fun to pleasure her tiny body, have her completely at her mercy. Bartholomew seemed to think so too because he bolted to the tip of her fingers, itching to greet the beautiful blue woman.

Annabel reached up to the sprite, who watched the blue little dragon intently before her eyes widened in awe.

"A living enchantment?" Immi squeaked.

"Yes," Annabel explained. "Chris created him when we completed my binding ceremony, to protect me. He's called Bartholomew, he's quite mischievous."

"I didn't know what I was doing at the time though," Chris qualified.

"Amazing," the sprite also reached out to touch the little dragon on Annabel's skin. "I'd thought him just some sort of magical tattoo but once I noticed him with all my senses... he is so much more. Hello, little dragon I'm Immianthe, seventh in line to the broken throne, not that that means anything. You may call me Immi. We will work together to keep our Master and Mistress safe, no?"

Bartholomew agreed with an especially thick belch of purple smoke.

"Delightful," the sprite confirmed.

"Wait, spawn?" Chris asked, finally processing what the sprite had said before they'd all gotten distracted by Bartholomew.

"Yes, of course. If you'd do me the honour, you will prick me with your fang and impregnate me so our little spritelings can be let loose across the land."

Chris was at a loss.

"Spritelings? How many are there?" Annabel asked.

"Several hundred thousand."

"No way, all at once?"

"Of course, they're very small."

"I don't know what to say," answered Chris apologetically.

"You don't have to say anything. It could be several years away but with any luck, you'll grow feelings for me and be my first mate. You've made me so happy already, dragon."

"Oh, that's so cute. Sweetie, of course he'll do that for you," Annabel gushed. "We're going to have babies too, eventually."

Chris shook his head as the wet beauties conspired against him. There was definitely magic at play here and he couldn't help feeling guilty that he was unconsciously manipulating them. Regardless, the dragon rumbled approval deep in his chest at the thought of seeding another mate.

<em>Her species is almost as threatened as ours. This is a chance to save them too. </em>

"Thank you, Annabel. In the meantime, I'm sure I could find uses for his stuff, make sure it doesn't go to waste?" proposed the sprite, impishly sitting in her perch, half under a thick spray of hot water.

"I'm sure you could," Chris muttered, reliving the vivid image of the sprite being splattered as she writhed on Annabel's back.

Annabel slapped his peck, "You were thinking about it again weren't you?"

He grinned sheepishly, it had been very hot.

"I blame you, you've corrupted my boyfriend, you nasty little ... cum slut!" Annabel flicked some water the culprit's way.

"I can't help it! You know what he's like," the sprite pleaded innocence.

A playful, giggily shower battle ensued, the sprite using the dragon's bulk as cover from the human's grasping hands and hurling little shocks of electricity or cold at Annabel, harmless but making her scream nonetheless. They flung innuendo back and forth. Eventually, the dragon caught them both and made them make up, which they did happily enough after their play-fight. It ended up turning out into a ten minute make-out session between he and Annabel, after which the dragon took his time to wash their lithe bodies <em>very</em> thoroughly.

"He's having sex with her already?" Susan's voice raised in unconstrained worry.

"Well, in as much sense of the word as possible given the physical limitations," Lillian explained, drawing a slurp of blood through the straw. "Some of the old enamouring enchantments used to use certain Sprite...How do I say this politely, ingredients? If you remember, Susan. Now she's bound herself to him, apparently offering her food is some sort of magical contract. Reyla wasn't at all happy, she seemed very surprised that a female sprite was even in the area."

It'd gotten late and Lillian had almost picked up her phone to find out where the witch and the human had gotten themselves lost but they'd just walked through the door.

It was truly night outside now, the lights of the larger city but especially the active Being district shone up through the wide windows into the dimly lit kitchen where the three women conferred.

"Well that explains why Reyla was distracted today," Michelle said. "Things didn't go so well, she snapped at one of the legal experts we had in conference, threatened to curse his lineage if he didn't start thinking intelligently. Wait, she can't actually do that, can she?"

"Yes, but not without consequence after yesterday's decree by the Synod," replied the vampire. "Reyla is usually short-tempered at the best of times but today would have been especially bad. She was aggravated by this sprite and wounded Chris when she meant to kill little woman. To top it all off, I stood aside when the dragon could very easily have meant her harm. That he only ended up telling her off like she was a spoiled child is perhaps worse than if he had."

"What did she get Chris with?" Susan assumed her son's injuries couldn't have been too bad or she'd have heard about it before now. To be honest, she was still more concerned about him taking up with the sprite so readily.

"Shadefrost, he's been healing well today but it must've hurt like hell."

Susan's motherly instincts flared visibly as her demeanour stiffened. How dare the Drow use borderline dark magic on him!

Lillian saw her reaction and put a steadying hand on the witch's shoulder.

"He stood in front of her spell to protect the sprite. For what it's worth, Reyla seemed very put out about hurting him. She sent over a powerful salve to help him heal right away."

"He's in his room?" Susan asked.

"He and Annabel went to bed early with Immianthe trailing along. That's the sprite, and she's quite rambunctious. He said he's feeling okay, just really tired and still a bit chilled."

Susan didn't respond, resisting the urge to barge into his bedroom to check on him.

"So she can just get away with attacking him?" Michelle asked.

"Well essentially, yes," Lillian spoke. "Chris could have fought her or maybe demanded compensation of some sort but it's her territory. She has the power to punish and even kill her subjects with only marginal justification if she chooses so. She'd need more because he's a dragon but the Synod would only step in if things got really out of hand. She didn't even mean to hit him, the sprite was definitely asking for trouble."

"Huh," Michelle murmured. "Things are really going to have to change around here. I can see why we got almost nowhere today, we've been assuming you have some sort of justice system with sensible rules and laws, like we do."

"We do," the vampire flashed her fangs in a wicked smile at the human before sucking out the last of her blood bag obnoxiously noisily.

"How's that?" Michelle asked when no explanation was forthcoming.

"Don't get caught, don't piss off the powerful, and protect the Secret."

"So, what? Just fight it out? That's Barbaric."

"You can't apply human logic and laws to everything Beings do. We aren't human. Our system has worked for thousands of years, but you humans are in the process of toppling one of the constants every Being has known and clung to since birth; humans don't know about us. That's going to be hard for some of us to deal with, not to mention these new restrictions."

Michelle thought that over for several moments. Realising she needed to reconsider her vision of how the Revelation would unfold. She'd been hoping Beings and humans could be covered by a single set of laws but who knows how it was going to work.

"You said you let him past you when you thought he might hurt Reyla, how is that possible?" Susan noticed the importance of the vampire's admission and even managed to hold her fierce gaze until Lillian was forced to lower her eyes.

"I don't know," Lillian spoke very quietly. "It's getting harder.... sometimes I just want to taste him so badly."

"Oh, Lillian, I'm sorry," it was Susan's turn to provide comfort. She couldn't imagine what the vampire was going through but it must have been a terribly cruel hearted decision to knowingly assign Lillian to guard her son. The thing was, it had been good for him and they appeared to get on so well that Susan couldn't help but be a little thankful. "There must be a way, to break it I mean?"

Lillian's eyes flicked to the witch, trying to convey the danger of continuing the conversation in the monitored apartment.

"No, I must be released. Reyla and I have our differences but our bloodpact is useful to both of us," Lillian lied through her fangs, doing her best to act sincere for the sake of her own safety. She wouldn't put it past the elf to destroy her after today's transgression.

Susan was instantly ashamed at her mistake. She'd been removed from Beings far too long for her own good. Anything and everything could be used against you, she'd grown complacent in her time raising Chris.

Michelle was confused to say the least. There was suddenly tension and angst in the air. Words like bloodpact certainly had connotations she didn't like. Her inquisitive nature was about to force her to ask what was going on but Susan subtly moved closer along the kitchen island to grab a piece of fruit out of the basket and placed her foot gently on top of Michelle's.

As she bit into the crisp apple, Susan looked meaningfully at the NSA agent, the questions died in Michelle's throat, replaced by a surreptitious swallow.

"Well, you've had dinner, Lillian, so why don't I take Michelle down to the lobby café for some of our own?" Susan said. "I imagine that Chris and Annabel had the right idea going to bed early, we've all got big days tomorrow."

"I'm sure chaperoning your son on a date can't be too tiring," Lillian smiled.

"It's alright for you, Lillian. You're not the one handing over your lover to an untried dragoness," Susan said, happy that the mood had brightened almost instantly. Perhaps even quick enough for a nosy Drow to overlook the poorly veiled colluding.

"You can only blame yourself for raising such a lecherous, unfaithful, womanising, boy," the vampire shot back.

Michelle's mouth dropped open before she realised Lillian was, of course, joking.

Susan only smiled knowingly as she grabbed Michelle's hand and pulled her towards the door. Lillian had it all wrong, when you were with Chris, it was like you were the only thing in the universe that mattered to him and he was the only thing that mattered to you. At least that's how it felt to her. It was wonderful.

***

The sprite paced down his chest and out onto the ripples of the dragon's abdomen, putting a hitch in her hips for his benefit as she felt his big, reptilian eyes following her shapely, naked butt. She turned, pausing to put her words together.

"I can sense you, obviously from quite a distance now that I know what's pulling me. It's even stronger here in the Ether. Just look at you!"

"He glows," Annabel agreed, snuggling closer against his side, her head resting on his shoulder. He stroked a hand through her hair just the way she liked, resting it on her scalp every now and then and scratching oh-so-lightly.

"Yes. But he sticks out like a sore wing. It displays too much power. Anyone who wants to find you wouldn't have a hard time with the help of even an acolyte psycer or anyone in tune with the flows of the Ether."

"Radek," Chris murmured, making Immianthe's warm footing vibrate like a gentle massage.

"Exactly. A Being as dark and powerful as you've described him doesn't simply let you get away. If not him then someone else, eventually, will be looking for you. We must all be ready to fight back," Immianthe said as she paced back up his cream-coloured sternum, adjacent to her mistress's face where that delightful little tattoo was lurking behind an ear, eager to play.

"Even you, little Immi?" Chris asked with a grin.

Immi whirled on him, grabbing hold of his chin and leaning up to look into his eyes. "Yes of course me! Just because I'm small you big Beings disregard... oooohhh!"

Chris interrupted her with his dexterous, forked tongue, skimming her tummy and tiny breasts.

"Mmmhhh, don't stop, Master," she leaned closer across his lips so he could mouth her entire torso while his tongue slipped past her tiny bush, between her moist, warm thighs; giving her some wonderful stimulation. "We sprites... hhhrrrrm, are quite... yes keep going... formidable!"

She reached all the way up, pulling at small handfuls of his purple hair, gyrating enthusiastically on his hot tongue as it smothered her slickening, greedy, little womanhood. However, it seemed he was only playing with her as he moved it back up to her tummy and blew her a little raspberry. She giggled and retreated.

"My fearsome little warrior, defeated with a few licks," Chris chuckled after bringing his tongue back to sample her delightfuly addictive flavour. He blew cool air across her damp skin, making her shiver.

"Tease," the sprite accused, backing away to find a spot across his chest to lie down, kicking her legs up behind her as she rolled around a little and found herself face to face with Annabel. The sprite reached out an arm and touched her nose affectionately. "Back to the serious stuff, and no more distractions, dragon. How am I supposed to help educate you two when you divert me like that? I've got enough problems with my attention span as it is!"

"Okay, okay, Immi," Annabel soothed. "Continue please, I'll keep him in line."

"Well, as I was saying, it's important to learn to reduce your presence, not only for safety's sake but because it is a helpful exercise in the basic manipulation of energy. When using magic, you draw energy to the surface from your magical centre. Then you mould that energy into your desired outcome using images, intentions, incantations, or objects. When you release that energy, your magic takes form."

Immi paused to look up. The dragon's head was propped on some comfy looking pillows so he could watch her, which he was doing intently. Her little heart fluttered excitedly at having his eyes on her.

"To hide yourself," the sprite continued, "you essentially do the opposite. Focusing on the energy contained inside of you, force it down deeper, into a calm, quiet place. Then you must try to tame it and relax. It will be hard at first, but the more you practice, the easier it will be for you to access your magic at any time. This is an excellent exercise for beginners."

"So it's like stretching or yoga?" Annabel asked.

"What's y.o.g.a?" Immi spelled out.

"Hehe, never mind, Immi," Chris said. "Annabel means an exercise which doesn't necessarily make you better towards a specific goal but will improve your all around strength, flexibility, and fitness."

"Then yes, it's like that," the sprite chirped.

"But I don't even feel anything when Bartholomew uses magic. There's no warning, he just does it."

"He is responsive and intelligent, no?" Immianthe lectured, waving a hand at the boisterous tattoo as it played across Annabel's hand which rested close to the sprite on the dragon's finely scaled chest.

Annabel nodded with a smile as her little dragon turned to look up at her, hopeful for approval.

"Then you must learn to communicate with him and embrace the magic of this wonderful enchantment so that you are one Being."

Annabel's breath hitched at Immi's use of the word. Could she be... a Being? Perhaps not in the true sense of the word but that wouldn't matter to her so much. She could be something more than human. Something relevant, someone to stand beside a dragon and meet all challenges!

Chris's lips and nose touched down gently in her brown hair as if he'd sensed her thoughts, extracting a happy coo from her as he snuffled into her scalp reassuringly. She looked down at her hand where it rested beside the sprite and made a plea in her mind to her little dragon.

<em>Will you help me, Bartholomew? This is so crazy, I'm talking to a magic tattoo but they say you're alive, that you can change and grow... Together we could... Can we grow into something meaningful, someone who can make a difference? I want to stay with him forever but... Please, will you help me?</em>

He stared directly back at her. It was so intense that she felt sure he was weighing a decision very carefully.

Suddenly he broke his stillness with a tiny head bob and a puff of smoke.

Annabel gasped audibly as she felt a jolt travel her entire body. Heat leapt up her wrist from the tattoo, streaking painfully towards her chest, taking hold and throbbing. It intensified quickly to almost unbearable levels but thankfully the worst past quickly. She squirmed uncomfortably as slowly, the feeling eased, the heat cooling.

"Annabel, what's wrong?" Chris asked.

"He, he's... I can feel something, a spark in my chest," Annabel took a deep breath to calm her racing heart. "I asked him to help me. I... I think he's somehow merged more deeply with me."

"Whoa," Chris murmured as Bartholomew obviously nodded in agreement. He looked a little tired from the whole ordeal. Chris reached across with his free hand to stroke Annabel's skin where he was curling up to rest. "Thank you, Bartholomew."

<em>Thank you!</em> Annabel echoed at him in her mind.

He merely ruffled his little purple wings and wrapped his tail up and around her wrist. She felt the spark, for she didn't know how else to describe it, calm and pulsate gently as he fell asleep.

"He is a truly remarkable enchantment," Immianthe agreed. "Perhaps you two will be more in harmony."

"I hope so," Annabel said before turning her head to steal a soft kiss from her lover.

"Do you want to practice yourself, Chris?" Immi asked.

"Um, sure but you're going to have to guide me through it."

Chris was a bit apprehensive, the magic he'd pulled off so far had mostly come from the dragon, not his own impetus.

"Of course, Master. Just do as I've said, feel for your energy as if you're about to cast. Focus on it, only a little though, please. We don't want to blow a hole in the wall if you cannot concentrate."

Chris looked askance at the sprite but felt inside himself for that energy which lurked just below his normal human consciousness. He pulled at it gently, it was much slower than when the dragon was actively guiding him but he could feel it begin to focus in his solar plexus.

"Good, Chris, good," Immi encouraged him, feeling the magic coming to the surface right underneath her. "Can you hold it there?"

Chris nodded, but it was becoming uncomfortable. It was obvious the magic wanted an outlet. Once called upon, it was eager to find its new form, embrace its release.

"Okay, now try to push it downward, deeper. Contain it, try to calm it and relax yourself."

Saying that was all well and good, Chris thought, but it was a completely different kettle of fish to put it into practice when he'd never done anything like this before. He didn't want to try to talk and loose his concentration but his efforts to push the stubborn orb down inside himself weren't working. Frustrated, he tried making a mental shove at the imagined ball.

It only hummed louder, like an angry wasp.

"Relax, Chris, don't force it," Immi soothed as Annabel stroked a comforting hand across his skin.

He was really trying, but the energy was getting more aggravated as he stressed. He took a deep breath through his nose and swallowed anxiously, resetting his efforts.

To his relief, the ball shifted. He gulped again and tried to apply gentle pressure, pushing his own essence and magic deeper within himself. It was working! Ever so slowly the orb descended past the prostrate sprite, into his belly.

The further it went, the easier it became, and as he realised it was going to work he relaxed even further until the ball came to a soft barrier right by his belly button. He felt it notch into place of its own accord, sinking into a dormant or hidden state. He finally understood how the process could conceal one's power and aura, for the energy in his belly seemed far smaller to what he had been struggling with in his chest just moments ago. It still vibrated lazily every few moments but it wasn't a struggle to hold.

"Nice work," Immi praised as Annabel looked up to find her dragon smiling nervously. "The hard part is over but the mastery is in the art of holding, not pushing it down inside you. The trick is to become used to the sensation so that you don't have to think about keeping it there. The more of yourself you try to hide, the harder it is to hold and conceal."

"Do Beings just go around like this all the time?" Annabel asked.

"Some," replied the sprite, "but it is not as easy to maintain when distractions are present; engaging in conversation or even walking down the street might be too much for most Beings. In our world though, it is always wise to hold something in reserve."

"Isn't it a bit dishonest? I mean going around pretending to be weaker than you are?" Annabel didn't like the idea that any Being they met could be far from what they appeared to be on the surface.

"On the contrary, it helps to keep everyone honest," Immi said. "If you don't know for sure who you're dealing with, it's best to be polite and careful. But don't worry about it too much, most Beings don't bother. For someone like our dragon, though, it could be important. Besides, I'm running this lesson and it's a good place to start!"

"It's always good to have an ace up..." Chris started but spluttered and coughed heavily as the energy he'd been holding spotted a chance to make a break for its freedom at lower entropy.

Smoke billowed from his mouth as he coughed, carrying tiny purple and yellow embers upwards as both Immi and Annabel started backwards. It surged back up through his body, some escaping in where it found the opportunity but most settling back in his solar plexus where it was more stable.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
Chris watched his efforts go up in smoke, literally, and realised that Immi had been right, it was hard to maintain the concentration required to keep the energy in check, contained where it didn't want to be.

He would have to work at it so it was automatic, not requiring his attention every second. He swallowed, then burped out a final little mushroom cloud of soot before looking apologetically towards his audience.

Annabel was smiling brightly at him.

"You're such a doofus sometimes."

"It's harder than it sounds," he defended with a toothy grin.

"Yes. And you did well for your first time," Immianthe added.

"Thank you, Immi," he reached to stroke a finger down her back. "I really appreciate you helping us."

"It's the least I can do, Master," she crooned underneath his touch.

"I think it's time we actually got some sleep though. Tomorrow might be a bit... well, it's certainly a daunting prospect," Chris wasn't entirely sure how he felt about meeting the two dragonesses. He was certainly nervous though. To be honest, he wasn't sure he would get to sleep easily at all.

"It will be fine, babe," Annabel soothed.

"Thanks, Dee. Should we go back now?"

She nodded and he began pulling her with him as the colours and textures around them became whole again. The light changed quality quickly, now a soft yellow from the lamp in their room.

The air felt thicker and he breathed deeply the rich scents his sensitive reptilian tongue and nose had been unconsciously missing in the Ether.

Dominating his senses was his First's lovely smell, which he savoured as he pulled her close and settled them down into the bed. The sprite merged back of her own accord a few moments later and seemed happy enough with her position on his chest.

He ruffled his wings a little underneath himself and pulled the sheet across them all, enjoying the soft breeze it created at it settled and the light caress of fabric on his skin. With his other arm he reached for the bedside lamp, submerging them in darkness.

The burn on his back was barely a dull throb now, causing enough discomfort to keep his tired body awake for only a few more moments as Annabel's breathing deepened and Immi settled herself down.

"Master?" came the sprite's whisper after several minutes of stillness.

"Yes, little one?" the dragon murmured back.

"I'm glad I found you."

"So am I."

His hand settled gently on her delicate form and she wrapped her arms possessively around his index finger, giving it a tiny kiss as they all eventually drifted into a peaceful, deep, sleep.

***

Chris enjoyed the ruffle of wind in his hair as he drove with the window cracked.

He liked driving, hadn't had much of a chance lately though. It was a nice day for it, sunny and not too hot; they were about thirty minutes out of Laramie now, having just crossed the state line.

The drive had been quiet. Lillian usually wasn't much of a talker, Annabel seemed preoccupied, and Susan either didn't like the sprite or didn't like how quickly she'd been accepted into their lives. He couldn't be sure.

Admittedly, he should be more cautious about letting the tiny woman in, he'd have to talk with his mother about it later. Regardless, he trusted his dragon's instinct when it came to the tiny woman who was now sitting in his lap as he drove down the deserted highway.

The sprite was in love with modern music from the moment Annabel had turned on the radio in Susan's Subaru, dancing around the car, barely bothering to stay below the vision of other drivers. Her activity, along with the early afternoon sun had finally worn her out and she'd fallen asleep up against him after begging unashamedly for a morsel of food.

The warm air tickled his nostrils as he concentrated on the road, attempting to keep his mind away from the upcoming meeting. Scents of the surrounding countryside and road reminded him of his childhood and helped keep him calm.

This was nice, he thought. If it weren't for the sordid reason for the trip, it would almost seem like they were a normal family... Okay maybe not, the roles were a bit wrong. But who cared anyway?

He was about to be mated to a young dragoness, the youngest dragon alive except for himself. On top of that, if he hit it off with her mother, all the better, according to Elizabeth Guthrie. It was exciting, his dragon was chomping at the bit just to scent her, a nice little female, one of his own species. Not to mention how he felt about beginning the rigorous process of impregnating her as soon as possible.

On the other hand, Chris was terrified. What if she rejected him, just like she had the other six males? What then? Did that mean he wasn't good enough?

He knew he had to try, understanding that their species was on the brink of extinction. Sure, in the moment he would probably enjoy it but it felt very staged and unnatural to his human mind.

Lillian's intel had described Claire Godran as a fiery young woman, quick witted and tempered, passionate, and perhaps a little spoilt. By all accounts her personality matched her aspect.

Petra, her mother, was several hundred years older and much more level headed, a fierce protector of her adult daughter. They were currently under protection in the Western Territory, living outside the hub city of Los Angeles, in San Diego.

Petra had called again from the road that morning, expecting to arrive around five that afternoon at the latest. Apparently both women were excited to meet him too but it didn't help to know that. Chris had one hell of a bunch of butterflies brewing in his tummy now that his mind had wandered back to them.

So he distracted himself with driving the five of them home to Laramie, to see Jethry, and perhaps attempt to save his species.

***

The little dairy ranch seemed unchanged, there was no reason it would have, but it felt like he'd transformed so much since he'd left that he thought it might be different too. It seemed months ago he'd left this place but really it was a matter of days or weeks.

The old werecat was on his porch waiting for them and as soon as he parked, Chris was on his way to give his friend a sound hug.

"It's good to see you boy. You've grown some," Remarked the werecat, sizing him up as they broke away.

"Yeah, some things changed when I came back to my human form. I gained a couple of inches among other things, I'm much stronger now too, even when I'm human."

"Good!" Jethry chuckled. "I've got some work for you to do before your guests arrive. I hired that Simmons kid from down the road to fill in for you but he's a human, doesn't have your stamina. I'd have done it myself you see, it's just my back's been acting up, you know."

Chris eyed him suspiciously. Sure, Jethry was old for a human, but he wasn't a human. It wouldn't be beneath him to play up an injury to get Chris to do some heavy chores he didn't want to do himself, he'd done it before.

"Alright old man, at least you're smart enough to admit you're not up to doing everything around here. We wouldn't want you to hurt yourself," Chris quipped back.

Jethry almost rose to the bait, but simply smiled graciously and went to greet the others, wounded pride was better than lifting heavy objects.

"Susan my dear, you look even more beautiful," Jethry practically bellowed as he strode past Chris, making her blush a little as they met on the gravel driveway, giving her a warm hug. Chris' scent was all over her though and he stepped back to look her in the eye. "You two..."

"Yes, Jethry, we're together now," Susan replied a little nervously.

"Good for you! I'd backed you to resist him for about a month maybe two but it appears I've greatly overestimated your self-restraint and sense of decency," His Cheshire grin gave away his game completely though.

"Oh shut up," Susan laughed, batting him playfully. She was really happy to see him again, still the same old Jethry.

"Ahh, and let's not forget the loveliest girl in Laramie, the spring flower, Annabel," Jethry purred, ever the charmer. "My dear, Is he treating you well? You know if you have a falling out, I've got two perfectly good shoulders to cry on."

"I'm great Jethry, thanks. It's good to see you again," Annabel replied happily but with a new appreciation for the elderly werecat.

"Jethry's got a bad back Annabel, if we ever break up you should probably look for more stable shoulders to lean on," Chris added, drawing a playful hiss and chuckle from him.

"Young people these days, no respect," Jethry muttered, playing his age to the limit. "Am I right, vampire?"

"Indeed," Lillian said from invisibility, leaning against the car and assessing her surroundings. "It's nice to meet you in person, I've heard a few old stories about you I'd find hard to believe."

"Back at you my dear, how about we reminisce later on tonight so I can ogle your assets, I hear they're legendary."

"They are," Annabel laughed. It was true, Lillian's body and especially her bust was world class, if you got a chance to see them.

Lillian was just thankful her blush was currently invisible too.

"You can come out too, little one. I don't bite, much," Jethry turned back to the car.

Immi, peaked around the door and fluttered up to Chris's shoulder.

"Hello, kitty," she squeaked.

"You're cute, so I'll let you get away with that," growled the werecat with no real menace.

"This is Immianthe, Immi for short," Chris introduced.

"Uh hunh, and how did you two meet? I can see she's already quite drogonstruck."

"We found her in the Ether," Annabel explained. "She was being attacked by a wraith and Chris healed her."

"I took the opportunity to bind myself to him and now he's my Master," Immi said.

"Immi, call me Chris. Remember?" Chris coaxed with an embarrassed glance at the werecat.

Jethry could only shake his head.

"You're unbelievable boy, you leave for barely two weeks and come back with all these beautiful women hanging from your arms, fetching to add another two while you're here."

"Um... yeah," Chris' embarrassment was rising.

"Good work, son!" Jethry clapped the startled dragon on the back. "Well go on, all of you. I've got a roast to prepare for tonight's dinner. I'll be over a bit later to throw it in your oven, Susan."

They unpacked the car and spent the rest of the afternoon mostly relaxing. Susan checked all her precious plants and found that Jethry had actually been doing exactly as she'd instructed, they were still flourishing, if slightly overgrown.

Lillian, Annabel, Immi, and Jethry played a couple of rounds of cards while Chris did some chores, mosty restacking some hay bales which had fallen off the pile and splitting a stack of particularly knotty pieces of wood which Jethry had given up on. It was actually enjoyable to be back doing things he felt so familiar with, it took his mind off the dragons he was about to meet. His newfound strength lent a comfortable easiness to the tasks he had already acquired the finesse for as a human.

Meanwhile at cards, Lillian used her telekinesis to hold her cards in front of her chair whilst floating very stealthily around to look her opponents' hands, confounding Jethry and Annabel greatly until she took pity and admitted her deception to cries of supreme outrage and laughter.

The time passed much too quickly for Chris. Five o'clock had just come and gone and he was nervously sitting at the kitchen bar. Annabel came and hugged him close, kissing him desperately, successfully conveying all her angst, which made him feel even worse.

The tension was palpable and Jethry excused himself, tactfully realising he probably shouldn't be there, at least in the beginning.

Susan was busying herself in the kitchen needlessly and Lillian was sat on a couch, visible now that the sun was low enough not to penetrate into the house. Immi was perched next to her, the least effected, she was looking forward to watching the dragons meet and mate.

***

"How much longer?" Claire whined.

"It's not far now, dear," Petra said patiently from the driver's seat of their SUV.

"But why do we have to come all the way out here, there's nothing out here!" She gestured out into the flat alpine farmland. It really did look quite barren.

"Your potential mate is out here, that's why," Petra said, a little snappily. She was on edge herself and although she could understand her daughter's nervousness, the constant questions about him and how long the drive would take were wearing her down. She sighed. "Sorry baby, I know you're nervous but I am too. It can't be more than a few minutes now."

"Oh God, Mom. What if he doesn't like me? What if he isn't right for me?" Claire worried aloud, fidgeting in her seat and twisting a strand of her red hair between her fingers.

"Shhh, it's okay, Claire-bear. There's nothing not to like and as for the second part, you can't do anything about it if you two don't match. Just promise me one thing?"

"What?"

"Just be nice to him, please. Don't be mean, he's only been fully awakened for a few weeks. If he isn't right for you just say so and be polite. I'll tan your ass if you put him off of dragons for good, so will Elizabeth."

In the past, Claire had sometimes been quite rude to her other potential mates when their advances weren't accepted. She hadn't clicked with any of the six males and sometimes, she'd let them know. This was her daughter's last chance to find a mate until another male was born, it could be hundreds of years. She'd prayed to her aspect, the wind, that her daughter would find happiness with this young male. That possibly, she could too.

"Okay, I'll try. I know I've only got one shot at this," Claire straightened her spaghetti-strapped tank top nervously against her toned tummy. She brushed lower to pull her blue, pleated mini skirt down a little.

Would she finally have a worthy male to hold her down and take her? Her dragon was eager inside her, she'd been lonely for so long, her biological clock was ticking, demanding she find a mate. However, she wouldn't settle for anything second rate. He had to be the best to tame her fire.

Apparently, he was a class one. That was intimidating.

Claire herself was a low class two whilst her Mom was mid to high in the same category. A class one was so much more powerful, exponentially so.

Doubt swept through her again. What if she hadn't worn the right clothes? She'd tried to go for a look that would entice him, something he'd associate with someone his age, even though she was about 45 years older she probably looked like she'd just hit twenty-one. Qualms flooded her nervous mind, her outfit was way too showy, practically slutty. What if she liked him but he didn't like her? What if they did mate? She'd never done anything with a man, her dragon rejecting any advances.

"Do we have time to stop so I can change?"

Petra looked over at her daughter curiously then chuckled. She must really be a nervous wreck.

"No baby, he isn't going to care what you're wearing, which is very provocative by the way. He's going to care about what's underneath your clothes. How you look, how you smell, how you taste, how you feel to his dragon."

Claire wished she could have her mother's exterior cool confidence. She was so beautiful with her platinum blond hair and perfect full curves, looking so pretty in jeans and a tight little blazer without even trying.

Sure, some guys drooled for her own body type, less curvy but toned and slim. Perky and tight, athletic. Her red hair and fine complexion was apparently also big plus too but right then, Claire would have swapped it all for just a little more confidence and experience to dispel the snakes writhing around inside her stomach.

Still, there was no denying, it was exciting. Terrifying but exciting. She might finally have sex! To feel fulfilled after an orgasm rather than unsatisfied and cranky like her masturbation sometimes left her.

"Mom, if we do... you know. What do I do?"

"I'm sure you're familiar with the biology. It'll come naturally dear, don't worry. Just let him take the lead and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Let him know what you want if he isn't already doing it."

Petra was a little distracted, the GPS indicated that they were right on top of their destination, only there wasn't a house in sight, just a long dirt road leading off around a small hill. She slowed all the way down as they approached, there was nothing else.

"This must be it."

"Here?" Claire had expected something more flashy for a dragon, their house in San Diego was huge, a veritable mansion with luscious gardens behind high walls with big gates.

"Elizabeth mentioned he grew up on a ranch," Petra said, turning into the driveway and building up a little speed, she didn't want to go too fast in their SUV though, the road was quite narrow and bumpy.

"If he's a hick, I'm gone," Claire joked to ease her mounting tension, it was almost palpable in the air now.

"That's not nice," Petra chided gently.

"It was a joke, Mom. Hey, do you feel that? It's...

Claire couldn't really describe the feeling, there was something potently magical nearby though, a Being or spell. It made the back of her neck tingle.

"That's him, Claire."

"No way! I can't even see him."

"He's a class one, high in the category if I'm not mistaken," explained Petra soothingly, she didn't want her daughter freaking out now. The male's presence was huge though, so strong, it called to her dragon and Petra could only assume it was doing the same to her daughter.

"I can feel him," Claire breathed, her dragon was basking in his aura as they got closer and closer. She'd never felt this with any of the others, it was almost overwhelming.

A barn came into view, followed by two houses and a parking area with a station wagon and an ancient but obviously well cared for pickup.

Petra pulled up and took a moment to feel out the male's presence. Elizabeth was right, he was the strongest she could remember feeling, and he was only two weeks old as a dragon. She looked over at her daughter, her eyes were closed and her chest was heaving.

"Let's go, Claire, this is it."

Petra opened her door as Claire did, hearing the front door of the nearest house open. She met Claire at the back of the SUV but they both stopped in their tracks as a faint scent wafted across their sensitive noses.

It was smoky and rich, spicy, and oh-so masculine. Petra felt her mouth water and her nostrils instantly flare.

<em>Jesus he must be a big one,</em> she thought to herself as she went to nudge her petrified daughter forwards. However, a new scent blossomed from her daughter then, a ripe, sweet, earthy smell. Strawberries. Claire's mating pheromones smelt of the ripest, sun-hot strawberries.

"Oh baby, already?" Petra asked, releasing her pheromones indicated that her daughter wanted to mate badly, that she accepted the male.

Claire simply nodded.

"You don't want to see him first? To meet him?"

<em>I don't need to,</em> Claire thought, shaking her head, beyond words at the moment because her dragon was dragging her towards him. She smiled briefly at her concerned mother, turned and stormed up the stairs to the front porch. Completely ignoring the witch at the door, pushing inside to find her destiny.

Petra jumped into action, quickly following her headstrong daughter before she got into trouble. "Sorry," she apologised to the witch. "I'm Petra, that was Claire. She's a bit high strung at the moment."

"No problem. It's nice to meet you. I'm Susan, Chris's broodmate and surrogate mother," Susan replied, extending her hand towards the dragoness for a brief handshake.

"Should we go check on them?"

"I think that's a good idea."

***

Chris could hardly believe his eyes, the redhead advancing on him was absolutely gorgeous. Slim and just a little shorter than Annabel's 5'8''. You could tell she was an athlete, the way her midriff had perfect muscle definition with pale, silky skin over the top; her red tank top clung to her and swelled around her breasts.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
Speaking of which, already he wanted to squeeze and nibble them until she screamed for mercy. Her waist tapered ridiculously, and although her hips were a little narrower than Annabel's, instinct told him her ass would be superb and toned too.

When he finally forced his eyes track back to her face, she was right in front of him where he sat on the high kitchen stool, a severe frown marring her pretty features.

Her definition was superb, high cheekbones made her look a little elflike, but she had a fuller jaw than most elves, and plush, full lips. Her long eyelashes stood out to him as being exceptionally beautiful, tinged with her natural lighter colouring, they were downright seductive. Stunning russet hair fell to below her shoulders, flowing slightly wavily and framing her angry face perfectly.

He didn't know what she was mad about but thought it made her even cuter. His dragon was bouncing around inside him, finally forcing him to focus on the information his nose was pumping desperately to his brain, trying to get through the intense visual stimulus.

She was ready, she wanted him, she wanted to mate. Saliva instantly filled his mouth and his canines ached, just waiting to pierce her and inject his itch. She smelled like warm earth and hot summer. There was something else though, something delicious which made her stand out from the scent he remembered from Elizabeth... strawberries, it was so thick he could almost swallow it, drink it from the air.

She stood barely more than two feet away with her hands on her hips and a scowl on her face as Susan and the other dragon entered and closed the door. He paid them no attention. Everyone was silent for a few more milliseconds before Chris' human mind clicked back into gear, wrenchching some control back from the over stimulated dragon.

Annabel was still at his side staring at the sexy redhead whilst clinging to his arm.

Daring to take his eyes off the haughty dragoness for a second, he disengaged his fiancé's grip, gave her a quick kiss at her temple and brushed some hair away behind her ear. She gave him a searching look, he could tell she was feeling vulnerable but she gave him a tiny smile anyway. It hurt him to do it but he gave her a gentle push backwards so she was behind him and looked meaningfully over at Lillian. The vampire silently got up and pulled Annabel away, leading the poor girl up to his room.

Downstairs, the room was filled with palpable tension.

He turned his full attention back to the woman presenting herself to him.

"I'm Chris. It's..."

"Hhisssstt!" Claire's dragon spat as it surged forwards powerfully, finally getting some recognition from their mate. Animal instinct taking over completely as she began a flash transformation. It was all she could do to stop herself from going into her complete dragon from, her mother had forbade her from that.

His inactivity was infuriating. <em>Didn't he know what her smell meant? Why wasn't he inside her already?</em>

Her red wings erupted from her shoulder blades and started growing as tiny ruby scales zipped across her skin, lightening to pure white across her front. Her nose flattened and her teeth sharpened. Little canine fanglets extended in her mouth as the deep red colour spread across her beautiful face. Her pupils lengthened vertically, irises blazing red with golden mottles as the transformation completed in matter of seconds. Tatters of cloth were torn from her glorious body with sharp white talons, baring herself before her mate.

He stood still in astonishment, which she took for indecision, hissing and spitting at him, daring him to resist her beauty.

The male did nothing. <em>What did that mean?</em>

Hurt, anger, and shame welled up inside her chest at his rejection, her dragon pulled a clawed fist back to strike at him in retaliation but suddenly he was before her, pressing close and towering above her with an already purple hand gripped tight around her throat.

"Oh dear. Manners, Claire," Petra muttered in the background but was unheard by the lusty dragons, they were in their own sphere of existence now.

"Do we need to stop them?" asked Susan, worried as her son practically choked the smaller female.

"Not on your life," breathed the other mother, pride and happiness filling her. Her daughter had found her mate.

Chris's dragon was in control, it had heard its mate's call and leapt to respond. It was going to take this petulant little female for his own and lovingly ruin her.

He changed in record time, purple Ether fire flashed across his skin as he transformed. It incinerated his clothes in a smokeless flash, an ostentatious display of power. He felt his transformation complete as his wings fleshed out and settled into place, almost touching the ceiling above his head while the tips brushed his ass.

The female in his grip whimpered up at him, he barred his fangs and snarled right back, trailing off into a lust-filled, deep purr. She struggled weakly as his snout lowered to nuzzle behind her ear in her long red locks, tickling and scenting her deeply.

He pushed closer but she withdrew, playing at reluctance now that she had his attention. As a result, he crowded her roughly back a few paces into the wall, making Susan jump away with a squeak. A huge erection rubbed against her pale tummy between the little indents of her abs, already wetting her with precum.

The dragon placed his snout against hers for a moment, sharing breath as their eyes duelled. Yes, she would make a fine mate. She was truly stunning, full of youth, pride, and heat. He would tame her soon though.

She had some fight left in her, some challenge in her eyes that he couldn't abide. He turned her head and licked her neck gently, removing his hold. The female quieted then, instinctively knowing what he was about to do. His fangs absolutely throbbed now, dripping something sweet yet bitter into his mouth. Without further hesitation, he sunk them deeply into her delicately scaled flesh, infusing his addictive itch directly into her bloodstream, into her being.

Claire screamed. A bestial, primal roar that trailed off to a wail of pleasure. It was official now, they were mated. She wouldn't take another so long as his itch coursed her veins. It was heady, spreading through her body like slow fire, like gradually immersing in slightly too hot water.

She was aroused and ready before, now there was a need so powerful and deep inside her it drove to point of desperation. Her entire body undulated as several deep ripples dominated her body.

Her puffy nethers flooded with her own stimulating juices, he would never go soft inside her no matter how long they mated, at least until she let him. Best of all, she felt the potent magic in his venom pool and slosh in her womb, forming a warm sphere, unlocking her fertility and readying her for his seed, engorging her uterus.

Finally he retracted his fangs from her sensitive, flushed flesh, moving up with little nips and kisses until they locked eyes for a moment and crushed their lips together. Forked tongues met around fang and tooth, tasting each other with a hunger usually reserved for starvation. Indeed, to Claire it felt as if she had been starving her whole life, only now finding delicious sustenance in the way he smelt, tasted, and felt as she wrapped her arms around her mate and clung for dear life.

Several minutes later, Chris finally broke away from her soft lips with a groan, pulling his head back to remove the temptation of her addictive kiss. It was strange for him to see her draconian features but his dragon loved it, she was so pretty as he stroked her flanks and rubbed his hardness against her soft skin.

Claire protested with a moan as he drew away, gripping his sides possessively and looking up to see a short-breathed smile plastered across his face. She wanted to see that loving, happy look on his face whenever she could. Pressing her sweaty forehead into his firm, creamy chest and looking down between them, she saw what she'd been feeling for the last few minutes; his beautiful cock rubbing slickly against her abdomen, now slippery with his excitement.

It looked so proud and angry with its large flaring crown, the girth and length of his shaft, the lattice of veins she could trace under the supple skin and the heat pouring off it. She felt no apprehension at his formidable size, she was designed to envelop him, to hold and trap him, to coax him.

Her confident hand reached down to cradle him even as she looked back up into his purple and golden eyes, flashing her own satisfied smile at her mate.

"I'm Chris," he introduced for a second time, perhaps words weren't necessary at that point but his human side felt he should say something. He reached to brush her ruby cheek with his purple thumb, perhaps portraying his feelings better with a touch.

"I know... Claire," she replied throatily as her hand ghosted up and down his length slowly, her claw tips feathering his glans <em>very</em> carefully. With his itch in her veins, their mating was a sure thing but his delays were still agonising. There would be time to talk and get to know each other after the animalistic sex.

"I ah... I'm honoured that you feel so strongly about being my mate. You're so beautiful but it's not just that, my dragon is calling out for you. He thinks... we think you're perfect."

Chris tried to explain the depth of his instincts even as her hand sought to undo him.

"Yes," she whispered back, leaning into his touch. "I feel it too but please, I need you. Your itch, I need you inside me. Please."

He replied with a kiss to her forehead, taking her hand and pulling her gently towards the living room.

***

"What do we do now?" Susan asked a little breathlessly, the intensity of what she'd just witnessed left her flushed and hot. Mind you, just her naked son in his half dragon form would have left her in a similar state. Watching the two dragons together was something else though, intense and erotic.

"They're beautiful together, I want to watch them!" Immi squeaked as she came to flutter by the two mothers, she'd been rubbing herself furiously as the kissed and fondled.

Petra was startled by the appearance of the blue sprite, a rare sub-Being indeed, it seemed like he had already started to attract admirers. Although, they couldn't really be blamed... She wanted to watch them too.

No, what she really wanted was for it to be her he led away to ravage. It was a struggle to drive those instincts back, she needed to give her daughter time to settle with her mate before approaching the magnificent young male herself. She still couldn't believe how potent his presence was, how large and powerful his half form became, dwarfing both her and her daughter. The scent which clung to him was very enticing and his unique purple colouring was testament to his aspect, making an appealing blend with his cream-coloured belly.

Her dragon approved wholeheartedly. Imagined images flashed through her mind, forcing a shiver to sweep up her body; him lying behind and inside her as his fangs sank into her shoulder and she cried out in ecstasy. Him holding her still and thrusting, using her savagely.

Pulling herself out of the heated fantasy, Petra found both the witch and the sprite looking expectantly, she knew what they wanted and an all too lecherous grin grew on her lips.

"It can't hurt to make sure there aren't any problems, at least at the start."

The sprite gave a little whoop and flew off after the pair, Susan and Petra followed more sedately but no less enthusiastically. Susan touched the dragon's elbow to turn her as a thought crossed her mind.

"You're not going to... you know, as well as her?"

Petra recognised a mother's concern in the witch's eyes, it struck a chord with her.

"I dearly want to but I'll try to wait until they're settled and comfortable. This is all for her, I've already know the joy of a mate, I'd be more than blessed if your son accepts me as well."

"Thank you. I worry about him, not just selfishly. He already has Annabel and I. I don't want to see him pulled in so many directions by us that he breaks."

The dragoness nodded thoughtfully, realising the witch's concern was based on human experiences.

"A dragon's love is infinite," she began thoughtfully. "He treasures his brood both as a whole and as individuals. He may love many women but when you're with him, you'll be his entire world. My daughter won't make him love you any less, his heart will grow so that it may love you both."

That struck Susan as a rather profound explanation of a dragon's brood. She nodded and continued to the living room archway, pausing with Petra by her side, ready to watch her son's love grow.

***

Privacy was out of the question as Chris felt eyes upon them, to be honest he didn't care about that. Instead he thought the couch might be more comfortable for Claire than the floor.

As it turned out, she chose a mixture of both, nodding her approval and sinking to her knees beside him. She gave the side of his painfully hard shaft a few fleeting kisses before turning away from him and arching her rear, spreading her legs a little and angling herself for mounting. Her wings fluttered in excitement, the white tips of her claws resting just above her offered butt.

Chris was tempted by her offer but felt their first time should be more intimate, face to face at least... he could explore her like this for a little while though.

He fell to his knees behind her, running his hands over her smallish but sculpted round ass and getting his first look at her perfect little pussy.

The almost pure white of her belly colouring extended to her labia, currently plush and full of excitement, spread slightly to reveal deep pink and the squishy frill of her tight inner lips. Her whole hairless mound was slick and glistening in the late afternoon light barely coming through the windows.

He couldn't help it, his snout automatically honed in on her pungent snatch, thick with her fruity pheromones. He sniffed tentatively, looking up over her back to see her watching, impatient yet indulgent. Focusing back on her centre, he realised that she looked quite small, he was going to have to be especially gentle with her.

"Please," She murmured again, wiggling her behind at him and buffeting his head gently with one of her wings. She could feel his breath on her aching sex and it was killing her.

"Sorry, I got carried away, you're beautiful," Chris replied before sinking his lips onto her, almost completely covering her and sucking gently.

Claire shuddered and hissed at his hot touch, the pressure of his suction quickly followed by the slippery heat of his tongue delving into her, the first invader that wasn't a toy or her own fingers. It was wonderful.

Chris's mouth tingled at her wonderful taste. The strawberries her pheromones promised him were faintly there, sweet, musky, and oh so wet and juicy. His penis flexed and jumped to painful hardness as her magical stimulants hit his tongue, he snorted loudly and gave her a final lick, brushing her tiny peaking button goodbye.

Just moments later she felt cool air caress her again as he pulled away, she was almost disappointed until she remembered with the touch of his hands at her hips that he was going to fuck her. He tried to roll her onto her back but she resisted, extending her wings on either side to prop herself in place.

"No. Do it like we're supposed to," She demanded.

The mating instinct coming from her dragon was so strong as she felt him give in to her desire and shuffle forwards, butting his hot, thick cockhead against her and spreading her open. Rubbing up and down against her sex wickedly, wetting himself thoroughly in preparation for stretching her tight opening.

She reached underneath to hold him in place as he leaned down across her back, resting some of his weight on her just like she wanted. Her breasts were squashed into the leather couch and she rubbed her chest back and forth for stimulation. His staggered breath was hot in her ear and his hands gripping her waist firmly as he paused for some sort of final approval.

"Don't be gentle," her dragon crooned. "You've won me. Now take me."

Despite her baiting, Chris was going to try to be gentle. His cockhead tingled maddeningly as her pussy wet him, he'd never been this hard in his life. He gave a gentle push, feeling her begin to stretch open but resist him firmly. She was moaning underneath him as he gave another harder push and felt her yield slowly before he reached some critical point and popped slickly into her heat.

"Oh fuck!" he cried, holding himself still with just his head barely inside her. He couldn't believe how hot and tight she was on him, already he could feel her walls shuddering and attempting to draw him further in.

"More!" Claire roared, "Give me all of it!"

She loved his hot, pulsing crown inside of her. Pleasure, tinged with a little pain shot up her nerves to her brain. He felt huge but her little snatch was up to the challenge, sopping wet and eager to capitulate before her mate.

Her body was beginning to vibrate already. She felt him push gently again, sinking slowly deeper but not deep enough. That wasn't going to make a difference though, it felt too good, she was pushing backwards even as her body began to shake and buck. A hissing, strangled cry was partially smothered into the couch cushions before she bowed upwards and thrashed violently.

"Fuck! Oh fuck... c..c..cuming!" she screamed as her orgasm pulled her under and tossed her about. His penis still thrust against her contractions, sinking even deeper as his fangs sunk into the back of her neck with a prick. Biting her, holding her, poisoning her with his itch. Her human mind lost control in ecstasy, leaving only her ecstatic dragon.

It was all Chris could do to hold onto her, she was lean and supernaturally strong just as he was. Her joyous pussy felt like it wanted nothing else to do with him, attempting to push him out with its fierce spasms, trying to flush him away with a gush of her clear pungent essence. He had to push roughly into her to keep seated, gripping her bucking hips hard enough to leave bruises on a normal woman. His dragon told him to bite her again so he held her down, flattening her wings, and pumped more and more of his fertility inducing venom right into her blood as she rode her orgasm. She kept groaning and twitching as she calmed, taking him a little deeper with each rhythmic clenching and opening of her hot channel.

Claire was weak and heavy as she came back into her own. She wanted more, she needed his seed. Pleasure had overloaded her system, leaving her hot and gooey. He was inching deeper with his constant pressure and her little movements, parting her with his thick manhood. He suddenly swapped her hips for a firm grip on her forewings and was pulling her back onto his spear. It was an amazing feeling, ever closer and closer to that ball of energy she could feel in her womb.

She took a few seconds to push some of her own magic towards that molten sphere, feeling their combined aspects meet and mate, just like they were doing. It made her shudder and experience a longer, gentle climax as her head dropped down and she panted into the cushions.

It was so improbable, but she desperately wanted a child with this wonderful, attentive male who introduced her to pleasure previously beyond her wildest dreams.

Finally her climax abated and she turned her head. He released her neck and they shared a brief over the shoulder kiss as she felt him begin a gentle thrusting, pulling out a little before delving ever deeper. Hands dropped her wings and wormed underneath to caress the sides of her tits, she moved to give him full access, placing her hands over his, urging him to fondle and rub her excited, springy flesh. His slow strokes had her crying out in no time.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
"Unnghh! Yes... good, so good! Harder! Please, give me your seed."

Chris finally felt a resistance against his tip as he pushed deeper to the end of her hot passage, he'd expected it sooner given how small and tight she seemed to be. It felt a little squishy and giving as he held himself still inside her, letting her get used to him for a moment and getting a measure of how far it was safe to thrust.

She wouldn't have it, she kept pushing backwards on him, butting her cervix against his over-thick crown.

From his experience with Susan and Annabel, he held back against her eager pressure, not wanting to hurt her. He looked down between their bodies to find her lips splayed beautifully around him and a few inches still outside of her. She wasn't as deep as either of his previous lovers but that didn't matter. She felt absolutely amazing as he began to thrust again, picking up the pace a little, withdrawing his glistening length and steadily giving it back to her, filling her tight, hungry pussy over and over. It wasn't going to take him long as he started to give it to her a little harder each time, making her huff and pant, she was loving it.

Despite the wonderful sensation of his fat shaft stuffing her, a frustrated moan left Claire's parted lips. She knew he had more so why was he still teasing her? He was so thick and hard inside her, stretching and rubbing her towards another climax already.

Every stroke now he would just brush the giving ring of muscle that guarded her womb, she would push back when he came close but he never penetrated her fully like she needed, holding their bodies a little apart with greedy handfuls of her springy ass cheeks. As her pleasure built and built, she'd finally had enough of his stupid teasing. She had no intention of cuming again without his hot sperm spewing directly into her womb.

"Stop teasing me you bastard, put it all the way in," she snapped over her shoulder at him.

"I can't, Claire, I don't want to hurt you," Chris panted back, he was trying to hold himself for her orgasm, he could feel her getting tense but it was going to be a close thing. She felt unbelievably warm and taut around his shaft, flexing her muscles to drive him wild.

The pained look of restraint on his face jolted her to a realisation. He didn't know.

"Oh baby," she huffed, fighting against her short breath. "I'm not like regular girls... you need to... go all the way... It won't hurt me."

It was so sad he was raised away from his own species, he should know these things, his father should have had a chance to tell him. She would just have to give him a crash course.

"What? Are you sure?"

"Yes! It's part of... mating. Please hurry, I'm going to cum!"

Disbelievingly, Chris slowed at depth, feeling the squishy barrier and pushing a little more forcefully against it. She moaned encouragement, arching her back and pushing against him. He let out a gasp as he felt it give a little, stretching more and more.

"Harder, push past it... Go all the way! Please!" she shouted.

Presenting such a beautiful sight with her scarlet hair flowing down across her back and wings, he gave in. Grasping a fistful of that hair at the base of her neck, he pulled her up against him, panting in her ear as he pushed hard and felt the ring of muscle slip tightly over his thickest part.

"Grraaahh..." Chris exhaled incredulously as his last few inches slipped steadily inside her. Her butt squished against his pelvis and his cockhead felt like it had just been transported to another dimension. A hot, very pleasurable dimension.

"That's fucking unbelievable!" he growled into her ear as he held still, fully inside a woman for the first time since his transformation, enjoying the unique strangling heat on his crown. "How is that even possible, where is my cock right now?"

"You're in my womb, Sire. Mmm, please keep fucking me!"

She encouraged him even as she sprung her delightful trap, her cervix tightening wickedly behind his glans. It was intensely pleasurable for Claire, she hadn't done this before, was acting on her mother's knowledge and her dragon's instinct. Her body shuddered as she closed behind him, a huge orgasm tremoring just beneath the surface. He was so deep inside her now, filling her completely... he wouldn't leave until she was ready.

"Holy shit," he breathed as he made a tiny experimental thrust. He could feel her pliant cervix tightly wrapped around his shaft, her vagina squeezing him rhythmically below and his arrowhead crown nestled in her almost scalding uterus. His balls even pressed against her labia and clit. He was going to cum. He tried to pull back and thrust but found himself unable to slip back through her cervix, it wouldn't go back over the flared ridge of his cockhead.

He was trapped, being milked as she began to shudder and cry out. Gripping her hair tighter, he began giving her frantic, hard, short thrusts. Pulling back and fighting against her snare before shoving barely inches back deep inside her, all the while growling in her ear like a wild beast.

This was it. This was what she needed. She was so full, taking all he had and reaping the pleasure as his thick shaft whipped her insides into a flurry. She couldn't believe she done it.

"Yes! You're mine now, mate me, give it to me! ...Please!... Breed me!" Her cry trailed off barely ten of his little strokes into their locked mating as her orgasm hit, her body seized in unadulterated bliss as she felt him thicken and pulse in reply.

"Oh god, cum. Please cum for me, Chris!" she screamed as her eyes shut tight, her toes curled, her wings fluttered and flexed.

He was surprisingly lucid as her body shook. It felt like she was trying to wring his dick out to dry with her pussy. Only it was completely pointless given how she was absolutely soaked, gushing tiny dribbles of joy out around his shaft. Her clutching heat was too good, too tight, and too wet for him to resist any longer. Pleasure throbbed through his dick as she came beautifully on him. He shivered, releasing control and letting her take him away.

"I'm with you, Claire," he whispered darkly in her ear as with a final thrust his abdomen almost cramped. His larger body hunched forward on top of her, his balls churned, his cock flexed and jumped. He felt molten sperm race up his shaft as if under volcanic pressure and growled in delight, erupting in a huge spurt, eyes shut tight as his face twisted in ecstasy. Pushing his cheek into her neck, he again sank his fang into her flesh.

He came and came, feeling every thick pulse shoot wonderfully down his length, his dragon was giving her everything, powerful jets of hot semen delivered directly to her receptive womb.

"Mmrrnnn... so good! Chris, I can feel it," Claire moaned, savouring every spurt and acknowledging each with breathless little hitches.

The climax never stopped, her body was shocked into submission at the sheer quantity of magic he was giving her. This couldn't be normal, it was far too much, both his physical volume and the magic. It was wonderful though, she'd looked forward to this moment all her adult life, feeling her mate's magical essence squirt deep inside, the ball of energy in her womb churning, shuddering and tightening with his huge contribution.

This revolutionary experience watered the seeds of a deep devotion already growing inside of her. She mightn't be his first, but she would be his fiercest advocate, his most zealous supporter, his most eager bitch, and of course his most fertile breeder. She would give herself completely, taking everything he had to give in return.

He was still hard inside her as he finally finished with a shudder and a moan. The stimulant in her juices, now coating his shaft and thighs, saw to that.

Her mate collapsed heavily on her back, pushing her into the couch. His head lolled to the side and his face came into view next to hers, his eyes were still closed in pleasure. She smiled wickedly as they panted into each other's mouths. This was exactly how she wanted him, his manhood trapped inside her, ready to give her more. Her knees hurt a little from the carpet and he was pressing her wings into her back but she couldn't complain, a small price to have her mate seated in her core, giving her profound orgasms, and attempting to make her a mother.

Chris opened an eye slowly as he recovered, finding her looking at him across bare inches with a sexy smile displaying her smaller fanglets. He pressed in and kissed her, drawing out a happy coo.

When he finally extracted himself from her hungry mouth, he was momentarily lost for words. His dragon mate was so beautiful in her freshly fucked state, the hooded eyes, the sweaty hair, the flair of the nostrils on her delicate ruby snout as she caught her breath.

"That was incredible Claire, I don't know what to say... thank you for choosing me."

"You're welcome, but Chris, believe me... I've been waiting for you for so long."

A sharp-toothed smile made her features glow, her eyes searching as she closed the small distance between them. They met for another languid kiss, capturing a gentler moment after their passionate first mating.

"You won't have to wait ever again," he spoke against her warm, crimson skin with tiny kisses.

"Thank you," she sniffed happily, her emotions almost overwhelming her.

Not wanting to lie on her too long, he moved back to extract himself. However he quickly found that she still held him hostage inside her.

"I'm not done with you yet," she coyly explained as she followed him, leaning up off the couch, humping back onto his hardness, drawing out a groan from her partner.

"Oh really?" he was currently oversensitive but would be happy to go again in a moment.

"Yeah, and I'm not going to let you go until I'm ready. I hope you're up to it, mate."

She extended her wings backwards and hooked the tips around his firm butt to pull him closer, reaching back at the same time with her hands to spread her cheeks and push him to full depth in a leisurely thrust.

Chris groaned at the stimulation, taking hold of her forearms and holding her arms behind her back. He tried to pull out, testing the strength of her trap. He gasped as the sensation shot up from his compressed cockhead. It felt incredible and instead of stopping, he kept trying to pull out. Her squishy yet unyielding cervix felt amazing rubbing and stretching against his ultra-sensitive ridge.

Stuffed full and feeling a wonderfully intense pressure against her sensitive ring of muscle, Claire enjoyed the sensation just as much as he did.

"Uunnggg! Baby, that feels so good. Stretch me all you want but you're not getting out!" she cried, tensing her pleasured insides around his large shaft to prevent his escape.

A sinful chuckle rose in his throat, she was magnificent.

His hands released her arms to ghost up her toned tummy and cup her soft breasts, squeezing the pale flesh and teasing her candied-cherry coloured nipples. His lips found her ear, kissing and licking her into giggles before nibbling her cute little lobe as he began his slow, deep thrusting again.

"I wouldn't dream of it," he growled.

***

Chris lost track of how many times they made love, sometimes continuing right through their orgasms or taking brief breaks snuggling on top of each other on the couch.

They explored each other's bodies as best they could with their constant joining, Chris especially liked how she seemed to love the underside of her tits nibbled and licked and how her upturned eraser-like nipples seemed just a little too big and pointy for her small red areola. This was his mate, someday his child would suckle rich nourishment from these same teats. Eventually, they began speaking in more than moans and growls in these breaks, getting a feel of each other quickly and enjoying what they found.

She explained their unique sexual biology in detail, with hands on demonstrations. Her cervix, if it could truly be called that, was far more elastic, durable, and animated than a normal human woman's. At least it was when she was ready to mate. As well as the lower reaches of her womb, it was full of sensitive nerves, giving a huge amount of pleasure as well as allowing her full control over its tautness.

His distinctively flared glans with its exaggerated ridge acted as a barb, readily inserted but difficult to remove, requiring several minutes of concentrated relaxation on her part to loosen enough. She explained that male dragons were naturally well endowed to be able to pull off this feat and force a very snug fit. Although from her mother's description, Chris seemed nicely gifted to fit more than just his cockhead inside her womb. His size proved to supply some exquisite thrusting room as they took their evolutionary anomalies for a test drive.

The theory was that all this had evolved millennia ago to ensure long, drawn out matings with multiple inseminations. He could certainly attest to that. It was a good thing too, given how difficult it was for them to reproduce, how much energy was required as well as good luck to create new life as magically powerful as a dragon.

Eventually, completely satisfied that she had him trapped with more than just her incredible pussy, Claire relaxed and released his manhood, turning to cuddle and kiss her mate. She was astonished to feel the beginnings of a deep bond forming between them, on top of the chemistry their dragons obviously shared.

That didn't mean she was done with him though. As the hours rolled by and the sun finally set, she would tease him to hardness and have him back inside her in a flash, riding him with abandon or begging him to ravage her... but always demanding his seed with a hunger born from animal instinct. It was her first shot at real sex and she couldn't get enough. As their lust mellowed and the breaks for recovery lengthened, they talked.

Chris recapped his life for what felt like the five hundredth time in two weeks, giving her a more detailed version than he usually did, however. He even told her what he remembered of that blurry last night he saw his father.

"Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry," she said, stroking his cheek comfortingly as he finished his tale. "I lost my dad when I was young too, I was only eleven."

They lay facing each other on the couch, arms intertwined, lazily petting.

"That must have been hard, I mean I don't really remember much about him. I think it would have been harder if I'd grown up with him and formed all those memories only to then have him taken away, like you did."

"It was hard," Claire confirmed. "It screwed me up big time. For years I hated going anywhere; I was so scared I wouldn't even talk to other Beings except Mom. Then when I started to get a little older Mom got me into self-defence and magical training, that's boosted my confidence a lot. I'm still a bit of a shut in by most people's standards though."

"I'm sorry, Claire, that sounds really sad."

"It's okay, it was a long time ago. Besides, I enjoy all the training and working out. It's good to feel like I've got a fighting chance if someone ever came for me or Mom."

"Yeah, Lillian, my vampire bodyguard, has just started giving me some lessons. She's pretty rough though, usually wipes the floor with me. Maybe you could help out some time, you know, maybe go a little easy?"

"Haha," she giggled softly. "I could help, but I wouldn't go easy on you. There'd be no point. And besides, you're much stronger than me so that hardly seems fair."

"Unnggg," Chris groaned as she nuzzled her nose against his chin, "another woman hell bent on beating my ass."

"I won't do any permanent harm, it's such a nice ass," she made her point with a little pinch, making him jolt. She couldn't help but smile.

"So what do you and your Mom do, you know, day to day?" Chris enquired.

"Well, we both have part time jobs at a local twenty four hour clinic. It's run by the pack of werewolves who took us under their wing when we first moved to San Diego. We're honorary pack members now."

"That's neat but you make a living working at a clinic part time?"

"Oh, no, we do that to help out. It's a really good way for the pack to integrate into the human community and make a positive impact. Mom and I have our own business through Maginet in order to get by."

"Awesome, I was thinking about doing that too," Chris said. "What do you do?"

"It's pretty simple really," Claire explained. "As I'm sure you've noticed, dragons have very strong links to their aspects, giving us lots of available energy in the right conditions. Mom and I take orders on Maginet to recharge magical items."

"Huh," Chris was a little crestfallen, "I was thinking about doing pretty much the same thing."

"Don't feel bad, a lot of dragons do it. People always need stuff recharged."

"Damn, I guess I'll have to take up some of the offers I've had to pimp myself out instead," he smirked.

"You," she poked him in the chest. "Will," she poked him again. "Not," she kissed him quickly on the lips, drawing out a shocked little splutter. "If you need money, you can help Mom and I."

"Okay," he surrendered with a grin. "How does that work for you two though? I've only tried it a few times with Susan after... you know. She was the one who filled the crystals anyway."

"After what?" Claire asked knowingly.

"You know," he murmured.

"Say it," she threatened.

"Sex," Chris whispered, not quite knowing why he felt so bashful about it, Claire already knew.

"She's one of your brood, there's no shame. What you should be saying is... after you fucked your foxy step mom deep and hard. As any self-respecting dragon male would."

Chris felt heat rise in his cheeks and was thankful for the darkness in the room and his dragon's colouring.

"Hrrm?" she murmured when nothing was forthcoming.

"Yeah, I guess," he sighed before playfully tickling her ribs. "You're not nearly as ladylike as I was promised."

"Eeep! I don't know what you've been told but I'm no lady. You've been fucking me for the last three hours too, or didn't you notice?"

"Oh, is that what that was?" he replied cheekily.

"Typical, cocky, male dragon. Anyway, energy transfer through sex is written into your DNA, it's part of how you reproduce. I suppose you and I could recharge gems like that but at the moment I'm being greedy and holding on to everything you give me, to hopefully help provide the spark of life."

"I see," Chris said, it made sense.

"And let me just say, that you've given me so much already I can barely hold it, Chris. It's like you're stretching me on a magical level too and you're not being gentle about it. I really hope we can make it happen soon because I don't know how much more I can take."

"I hope so too," he leaned in to snuffle against her skin and she returned his gesture of affection.

"Anyway," Claire continued. "Mom and I channel energy directly from our bodies into the object being recharged. With gems and metals it's pretty easy but some of the other items like wands or enchanted trinkets can be quite difficult. At the end of each day, we usually drain ourselves into an object that someone's sent us before we go to our aspect to replenish."

As Chris listened, he pulled her back on top of him without protest and began stroking up and down the thicker scales closer to her spine. She seemed to love it, shivering slightly, all the way to her wingtips as she continued to explain the process.

"It's a win-win for everyone. In the past, dragons were one of the main inlets of easily usable magic into our world. With the hunting, readily available energy became difficult to find and any surviving dragons stopped giving it out. We dragons might have trouble mastering magic outside of our aspects but we have huge reserves at our disposal, only elementals really have the ability to recharge as quickly as we do and they have a lot of trouble converting that energy into other forms. For a while there, it was hard to get a hold of full gems, which is a big problem for magical humans and even elves to a lesser extent. Now that everything's settled down a bit, Mom and I have been going as fast as we can to keep up with orders. We could definitely use your help, although I'm afraid it will have to wait until you've knocked me up and we see if Mom wants to mate you too."

--------------------------------------------
Chris sighed, he didn't really appreciate her cavalier attitude towards his mating but his dragon clearly thought he really had no right to complain.

"Well thanks for the explanation, I'm not sure what I can tell you in return other than how a farm runs or maybe a few funny stories. I'm totally new to this life."

"That would be nice, I guess. Tell me a story." Claire would be happy to feel the vibrations of his speech through their touching chests and really concentrate on enjoying the little back massage he was giving her.

Chris started to describe his life growing up on the farm, she seemed to love it, resting her ear against his shoulder as she lay on top of him, listening as he talked and breathed.

Soon, dragonish urges caught up to her and she lifted herself into position and slipped him slowly back inside her warm, slick centre; lying back down on his chest and urging him to continue as she made little bucking motions with her hips and whimpered involuntarily in pleasure.

Claire loved his body. Everything about it, he was tall, broad and well-muscled. He dwarfed her but still let her have her way, being a little dominant with him at times. She would never have had that with any of the other males.

Mostly however, she loved his smell, his presence, and that as they talked he looked up to her, treating her with reverence rather than coddling her like she was still a child. Sure, not all of the males were that bad, Lord Guthrie and even Alexander had seen her as an equal but there was really no spark there whatsoever.

Chris was wonderful, playful, sexy and attentive towards her. There wasn't an ounce of arrogance or posturing in his bones, even though he had more reason to be that way than most. He was a class one for god's sake, she could feel the power oozing off him, knew first-hand how freely he gave staggering amounts of energy in his moments of passion.

When he finally flipped them over and took his time finishing inside her yet again, he had her heart melting. Her legs were still spread wide, wrapped up and around his butt as she recovered, feeling his latest hot, sticky deposit pooling inside her womb and his magic jumping restlessly between her cells.

He'd tamed her without even trying. Leaving her to float on a fluffy, post-orgasmic cloud as he flipped them back over so she was on top of him again and began to describe some of the antics he'd gotten up to with Jethry over the years.

She perked up as he told her about his stash of gold, the small debacle he'd had trying to pay for Annabel's dress with dragon gold. It made her laugh, he was so young and sweet on the outside but his dragon had strong ties to the older ways. He actually enjoyed hunting and panning for gold, that was old school dragon stuff, no one had really bothered in several centuries. Her own family treasure, contributed to by both mother and daughter was mostly gems and metals they'd traded for their services over the years, kept in a small vault in their house. It didn't have the magical potency or use in witchcraft of Chris's hard-won gold but it had begun to magically multiply over the years, treasure always did around dragons.

He kept mentioning the girl named Annabel but seemed hesitant to come out and say where Claire stood in regards to her, he was clearly smitten with his human First. Claire could see it in his eyes as he talked about her, he truly loved her.

A good dragon broodmate, Claire wasn't jealous of that, it wasn't in her nature. Besides, his love would come to her in time. Chris's happiness seemed to orbit closely around the young woman, Claire would make sure she didn't upset that.

In truth, she was eager to meet the woman who'd held her mate's heart before he was even a dragon. She wanted to thank her for safeguarding his happiness and shaping him into the wonderful Being that was currently holding her. She would have to thank the witch too, without her bravery, he never would have survived that terrible night his father was hunted down.

They eventually began talking about each other's aspects. Claire was a little disbelieving as he described the magic he'd pulled off so far, without any training! Especially the living enchantment on Annabel. She had to keep reminding herself that he was class one. His carefree, gentle attitude didn't befit someone of his power. He was barely two weeks old.

"It's so cool that you can just go back to the Ether when you're sleeping, or whenever, I guess," Claire said, looking down at him in the darkness with her chin propped on his smooth sternum. "They took us into the Ether a few times at school, that was quite a while ago now, but I've never really felt the need to go back. I didn't find it pleasant, always feeling out of place and having my energy seep out of me so quickly. I was always scared of waiting too long, getting trapped and depleted to a lifeless ghoul."

"It's weird how everyone describes it like that," Chris couldn't fathom what it must feel like. "I've never felt anything like that. It just feels right. Like warm sunshine."

"There must be a lot of energy for you to use, with everything in the Norm having a small presence in there. That teleport you did...three quarters of the way across America... that must have been huge. I can only do it within a couple hundred miles unless maybe I was standing in a fire when I started."

In truth, it made her feel a little small, something she wasn't accustomed to at all.

"Wait, you actually stand in a fire to access your aspect? Doesn't it burn?"

"Yes. And no, it doesn't burn, silly!" Claire chuckled. "It's my aspect, just like the Ether to you."

"Well I guess that makes sense but it still sounds crazy," he said.

"It's way less crazy than being the master of another dimension where everything has a ghost presence."

"Hrmm, you've got me there."

"Of course I do," she laughed, the motion making her pause a moment as their sticky sexes jostled against each other. "Fire's really not so bad. I have a huge outdoor pit at home, it's about eight feet wide and lined with stones. I hooked up a couple of gas elements underneath to help me light it. I usually make a big pyre of chopped wood and branches, set it going, and when it's good and hot, I get in."

She paused to see if he had anything to say, but he must have been shocked silent.

"As it burns," Claire continued, "I like to lie down in the embers and absorb all the heat until it burns out. I can easily go to sleep like that, just like you and the ether."

"But... but... what about your clothes?" Chris asked.

"Well, I'm naked, of course."

"It sounds dangerous," Chris murmured.

"No it's not! I've got a special permit and a fire-hose right nearby. I could just extinguish it by absorbing it all at once anyway. The only real downside is that I spend a fortune on firewood. I could burn almost anything flammable I guess, like coal or diesel, but there's something so nice about a good wood fire."

"Your Mom's aspect isn't as crazy, is it?"

"Well, she's a wind dragon or maybe they're better known as thunder dragons. She's the most elegant flyer you'll ever see and when she's up there, she absorbs static electricity straight out of the clouds. Oh, Chris, she's so graceful when she's in the sky, she loves it more than anything."

"Where does she fly? I mean, wouldn't it be risky that she gets seen flying around over San Diego?" Chris wondered.

"You're right, it would. But one of the first bits of magic her parents taught her was to hide herself, either becoming truly invisible like some of the older vampires can or casting a spell so that humans don't take notice of her."

"So she can fly wherever and whenever she wants? Man, I really feel like I'm missing out." Chris fantasized for a moment, re-living those childhood dreams of soaring through the air, swooping low over the fields of Jethry's farm to playfully terrify the stock. He'd only flown once so far, mostly by accident, and only for a few moments. "Wait a minute, why didn't you guys fly here instead of driving?"

"There are a few reasons actually," Claire explained. "Firstly, it would be quite a long flight and I'm sure I couldn't hold my invisibility for so long, though Mon no doubt could. Also, Elizabeth thought it would be best if we remained in our mostly human forms, in case that triggered you to change into your dragon before you're truly ready. We also didn't know how the meeting would go, how long we'd be staying, so we wanted to bring along some things, clothes, toiletries, and etcetera. I'd say that was prudent, given how well you and I seem to get along."

She giggled at the thought of what exactly how well they'd been getting along these past few hours, momentarily shifting her body forward to nibble his chin. It stirred Chris to bring one of his hands into her hair and guided her to a kiss, their warm breath meeting before the soft touch of lips, and eventually tongues.

He could tell she was feeling frisky again by the way she squirmed provocatively, pretending that she was trying to get away from his hold in her silky hair while her tongue explored his sharp mouth and told an entirely different and more believable story. Her rich, fruity scent dominated his senses, intoxicating him; however, he fortified himself and used his grip to pull them gently apart.

Ever the fighter, Claire now struggled to keep their lips locked, even gripping his top lip between her fanglets. As he used a firmer grip and it became clear she wouldn't win, she released him with a frustrated breath, looking down to see him smiling lovingly up at her. His hand released her hair and moved to brush her cheek gently, his thumb stroking across the corner of her lips. She nestled into his touch, cherishing the care she could see in his eyes through the dim word of her enhanced nightime vision.

"My mate," Chris whispered, more to make himself believe that this beautiful, fiery creature was his.

Her insides seemed to liquefy into molten, buttery goo at his innocent, adoring stare and his quiet declaration.

"Yes," She hissed turning to kiss his palm before moving to nuzzle into the side of his face, her lips finding his ear, breath full of passion. "My mate, my sire, my love."

"Claire," his voice grew apologetic, "I love Annabel... I..."

"Shhh," the beautiful dragoness cooed. "I know. It will come. For now it's enough that we are mated."

"Okay," he stroked the back of her neck, his feelings rather jumbled. It was like he was being pulled in two directions; his human loyalty and love for Annabel versus his new, very powerful physical match between Claire and his dragon. The pull, the intoxication of Claire was almost scary but he truly loved Annabel, Susan too for that matter. "Annabel is my First, she will always be my true love."

"Love is infinite, Chris, limitless. You will come to realise this soon enough. Humans seem to think it is a weakness, a vulnerability, but love is exactly what makes a dragon brood a nigh unstoppable force; Beings united, strengthened by love."

"That's going to take a while to get my head around, Claire. Thank you though, that was quite eloquent. I'm honoured that you feel that way, I feel dirty that I can't truly return your feelings right now, though. I mean, I'm going to marry Annabel."

"That's fine," she began planting tiny kisses across the contours of his ear and down onto his jaw.

"Claire, why me? I don't have anything to offer, I don't even know what I'm doing?"

She stopped her teasing abruptly, a low growl in her throat and anger flaring inside her, directed first at his insecurity or whoever had planted such stupid ideas in his head. However, those hard feelings dissolved almost instantly at his confused look.

"Chris," she soothed, looking deep into his gold-rimmed irises, her hands cupping his face. "Why do you need to offer anything? It feels right, doesn't it?"

"Yes," he croaked.

"Exactly," Claire stroked her hands down chin, onto his neck, appreciating the musculature under his cream coloured scales before coming to rest on his chest as she pushed herself away from him, looking down at her mate in assessment.

Her short claws suddenly gripped him dangerously, digging into his pecks, little spikes of pain. It was so unexpected that it startled Chris, sending adrenaline pulsing outwards from his heart as his lungs expanded in a huge intake of breath. He moved to intercept her hands but she hissed a quiet warning. However, there was a twinkle in her eyes that told him he wasn't in any serious danger.

"Maybe you don't see what I see, but there's plenty to offer here. I don't like you talking about yourself like that. You are a dragon, a powerful, unique dragon, and you're my mate. Yes, you are young, perhaps innocent. In our world you need to be confident in who you are, your abilities, your feelings. I'll work on that with you, insecurities can be very dangerous, I know that first hand."

"Okay," Chris nodded dumbly.

"Okay," she smiled, giving a playful twist of her hips against the semi-flaccid penis trapped between their bodies. She extracted her claws and hunched downwards to kiss each spot she'd pricked his flawless, tiny scales. Ten kisses, ten little flicks of her tongue before she looked up mischievously at her mate and popped his little purple nipple into her mouth, teasing it quickly to firmness as she held his stare. His hand came to play through her ruby hair and she could feel him hardening down below.

"Show me some confidence," she looked up at him submissively, apologetic for using her claws on him.

He made no response, one hand simply stroking through her hair, the other up and down the outside of her thigh where she straddled him.

A frustrated sigh was on the tip of her tongue when his hand suddenly took a vicelike grip on the scruff of her neck. A little excited gasp escaped her instead, even as her body practically purred in response.

***

It was late, pitch black outside as they spooned on the couch, naked, still in their half forms. Their parents had long since had dinner over at Jethry's house and gone to bed, only looking in on the pair briefly as they still humped like bunnies.

Only Immianthe stopped by for any extended period of time, getting introduced to Claire as she rode him. The sprite sat down on Chris's chest in front of her to get a 'close up view.'

Annabel didn't emerge at all and Chris was thankful for that, she certainly didn't need to see him having sex with another woman. He worried about what she must be thinking, doubting that she was truly okay with it, as she said she was. Going to check on her would be wrong though, this time was for bonding with his newest broodmate.

Claire was currently teasing him in her position as little spoon. She had his hard shaft stuck between her thighs as they talked, rubbing her hot, wet labia back and forth over him. She was overflowing with their mixed essence, despite the thick stickiness of his spend, it dribbled out of her onto his crotch, her legs, and the couch. She'd been filled too many times not to.

Chris wasn't sure whether he was going to have to burn the soiled couch or somehow try to immortalize it. He was too busy trying to form coherent answers as he lay in wait, ready to pounce if she made the slightest mistake.

She would rub her sex on his cockhead, come maddeningly close to slipping onto him only to angle away and giggle infuriatingly at his smallest thrust.

Now he was feigning indifference as he nibbled her ruby coloured forewing with this head propped up on his elbow. His other hand was completely relaxed, letting her guide it to stroke up and down her tummy.

"What about Annabel, what does she do?" Claire asked over her shoulder, continuing her tease. She loved playing with him, was delighted that he let her.

Exciting him onto action with her moist sex rubbing on his manhood had been her goal. She'd wanted to have him so worked up that he would spring into action and take her again, teach him that even though she played and teased, she would never deny him. Instead it appeared he'd grown tired of her game and given up.

"Annabel is an excellent cook, she's got a dream of being a chef so she's enrolled at a culinary institute in Denver for the start of the semester."

"And Susan works at an apothecary, right?"

"Yeah, she just got that job recently through connections with her growing hobby though. Hey, what are we going to do? Are you going to come visit me from San Diego or what?"

"We're going to move, silly. As for what I'll do, I really don't know. We can always earn our keep and turn a profit no matter where we are."

"Wow," Chris paused. "You'd really move to Denver?"

"Of course, you're my mate."

She accentuated her meaning with a lazy slide of her pussy all the way to the tip of his shaft.

Chris saw his opportunity and thrust forwards suddenly, piercing several inches into her surprised snatch.

"Oh you fucker!" she yelped in shock, as her eyes shot wide open. He was so damn thick inside her. She playfully squirmed to escape but he would have none of it, his previously relaxed hand suddenly holding her firmly in place as he pushed deeper and deeper, securing his position.

"Ah ah ah, no running away now," he chuckled as he met her cervix and pushed through gently, worrying briefly that he would now hold other women to the standard of her unbelievable biology. "You teased me for the last twenty minutes, now comes my revenge. I think you're gonna' like it."

He began thrusting even as his hand crept down her smooth stomach towards her bare, slick mound.

"No! Please, Chris! Oh fuck that's big... No, it's too intense!" she cried as his fingers found their joining, wetting his digits with their juices before capturing her engorged clit between two fingers, sliding them up and down. He kept screwing firmly into her from behind as he rubbed her up and down, back and forth with his slick fingers.

His skilled treatment of her little love button made her squirm and buck, only stimulating herself further on his thrusting erection as it plundered her womb. She moaned, growled, and yelped at him but he didn't stop, forcing a rapid climax from her sexy, quaking body. Finally, as it felt like she would be overcome, he came inside her for the umpteenth time that night, sparking a final noisy, shuddering orgasm from his mate.

Claire was absolutely spent. She was completely satisfied, tired, very sweaty and even a little sore. Feeling none of the frustrating unfulfillment she was used to from her experiences with self-pleasure, she sighed and pulled his hand up to kiss, getting a small taste of their mixed essence.

It was perfect. She could feel that warm ball of energy stretching her womb, pulsing and growing from his last deposit even as he slowly extracted his wonderful cock from her clinging sheath. She knew her girl parts were going to be a very achy tomorrow morning. She already anticipated the discomfort as a badge of pride and besides, it shouldn't be too bad with her healing abilities.

A little sleepily, she wondered how she was going to go about day to day with that huge ball of magic constantly growing inside her, it felt like she was going to pop. He'd force fed her so much power over the past few hours but she'd loved every second.

It was a strangely comforting feeling though, something she didn't want to give up now that she had it. It was going to be a constant reminder in the months and years to come that she was finally mated. She would just have to get used to it. Her body became even more relaxed and sluggish as she poured her last remaining free energy into that sphere. Depleted, she turned and lay down on top of him, kissing his neck and face, murmuring sweetnesses again and again.

--------------------------------------------
Soon they dozed as their bodies cooled. Chris enjoyed the feeling of her breasts squashed against his chest, his softening penis trapped against her tummy. There would be a lot of dried, sticky mess in the morning but he didn't care. Her steady breath against his neck, and especially her wonderful scent soothed his dragon into a blissful state of contentment, a new mate.

He pulled a throw off the back of the couch and draped it over them and around them, settling in for the night with her held closely in his arms.

***

About half an hour later, as he was finally drifting into a deep sleep, Chris felt her body tremble briefly before a wave of happy energy hit him like a stampeding unicorn; dazing him with a huge smile on his face.

Somehow he just knew he'd done it, overcome the all odds, he was going to be a father.

Claire woke with a start as the sphere of energy suddenly imploded inside her in conjunction with his one victorious sperm burrowing into her egg. The magic obliterated whatever cosmic barriers kept them apart and quickly infused and coiled around the new life, ensuring its survival in that most perilous moment.

The leftover energy exploded outwards, announcing the triumphant couple's success.

She shrieked joyously, sitting up on him to hold her tummy in disbelief.

They'd done it, it usually took years!

A fleeting jolt of uncertainty washed over her, was she ready for this? She quickly realised it didn't matter, she was so happy. There was plenty of time to prepare and she had all the support she could ever want. Looking down, she found him smiling, waiting for her reaction.

First she laughed, then she cried a little and began kissing all over his face, ignoring his weak protests and smothering him in her budding affection.

"Thank you... Thank you... oh, Chirs, thank you," she recited over and over between her smooches, kissing every part of him that was easily in reach.

He finally captured her tear streaked face and kissed her back deeply, searchingly.

<a>"I'm humbled, Claire. It's a surprise, but certainly a good one."</a>

He brushed her hair back behind her ears affectionately, holding her gaze in the darkness with his enhanced vision.

"I'll be a good mother," she assured. "A perfect mate. Chris, just hold me, please?"

He wrapped her back up in his arms and she lay herself down on his chest again.

"I know baby, I know," he whispered before there was a thump of rapid footsteps upstairs in the hallway.

"Claire?!" Petra called out to her daughter. She'd been woken by the powerful pulse of energy and her daughter's happy shriek. She thought she recognised the feel of the energy but didn't dare to hope, it was neigh impossible.

"Mom! I can't believe he did it, I'm pregnant!" Claire shouted gleefully.

"Wh.. what?" Susan stuttered sleepily from her doorway as she saw Petra streak past her from the spare bedroom in what looked like a white negligee. The magic had startled her from a very pleasant dream and now she couldn't believe her ears. Claire was pregnant? She switched the hall light on, blinking uncomfortably and followed the commotion downstairs.

Petra was hugging her daughter, crying happily with her even as they giggled and laughed. It distracted Chris for a moment, giving him a front row seat to the show their breasts put on, rubbing and flattening against each other with only Petra's sheer nightclothes between them.

His attention was quickly brought back as the older dragon suddenly bent down to smother his mouth in a passionate kiss, flicking her tongue against his lips and requesting entry. He was taken aback, having not even been properly introduced to her before her daughter had attacked him that afternoon. Still, he accepted her tongue for a few very enjoyable moments before she pulled away. Damn she knew how to kiss.

"Thank you, Chris. This means so much to us," Petra explained as she held her hand over her daughter's tummy, using her magical senses to confirm the presence of the microscopic life inside her. "I don't know how you did it, it usually takes years."

"I can't take all the credit, it was a team effort," Chris replied as Claire took his hand and held it over their child as well.

"Yes, it certainly sounded that way," Petra laughed. "I didn't realise my daughter was such a little nympho."

"Oh shut up Mom, you're just jealous," Claire teased back.

"Of course I am baby, but I'm so proud too," the older dragon cooed.

Chris's purple skin darkened in embarrassment but he hoped no one noticed in the low light coming from the stairwell.

"It's really true?" Susan asked from the archway, receiving enthusiastic nods from both women. She wasn't quite sure what to think... but the beginning of any new life was something worth celebrating and she soon realised that. "Oh my god, sweetie so soon? Congratulations! Ohh... we're going to be grandmothers, I'm going to spoil that little dragon rotten."

"Not if I spoil it first!" Petra laughed before turning to her daughter. "I'm so excited! Can I get you two anything or do you just want to go to sleep? Wait, I've got to call Elizabeth right now."

"A drink of water would be great, Mom. Let poor Elizabeth sleep, it can wait until morning," Claire said before looking down to her mate questioningly. "Then I think we want to be alone again for a bit."

"Okay baby," Petra got up to get them a pitcher of water, Susan knelt down and gave her son a quick hug too.

"I'm proud of you too, honey," the witch said lovingly. "Both of you. I recognised the intensity I saw between you this afternoon but I couldn't place it for a while. I saw it between your parents, Chris. I was worried about you mating with someone you didn't know but once I recognised what I was seeing I knew you'd be great together."

Petra came back with a jug and a few cups, pulling Susan gently away and giving her a hug before they made their way back upstairs and switched off the light.

<em>I'm a father!</em> his dragon shouted gleefully, echoing around his orgasm-emptied head like a gunshot.

<em>Yes, we're a father. How did we do that by the way? </em>Chris asked sleepily as he and Claire settled back down.

<em>I don't know, we gave her almost everything we had. It must have been enough. We are magnificent after all, </em>the dragon preened.

<em>I think we got lucky,</em> Chris mused more realistically.

<em>Do you feel it though?</em> the dragon asked happily. <em>The warmth inside, so deep and pure. The love for our mate and our child?</em>

<em>Yes</em>, Chris smiled relaxing back into the couch with said mate's heat and weight resting comfortably on top of his tired, pleasured body.

***

Lillian lay still as death on the bed as the young woman beside her sniffled into her pillow.

The happy news had, of course, been loud enough for Annabel to hear. It had been strange laying next to the human, she didn't need to rest but Annabel had said she wanted the company as she fell asleep.

Now the vampire felt unbearably awkward, doing nothing as the human cried quietly.

Compassion won the day and the ancient vampire reached out and put a consoling hand on Annabel's back. After all, she could still remember what it was to be a young, insecure, and in love. Mind you, Moscow in the fifteen hundreds was a completely different world.

Annabel leapt at opportunity for comfort. Uncaring of its source, she rolled over and hugged the vampire's side, resting her head on her shoulder as she hiccupped a little.

The reaction shocked Lillian, she couldn't remember the last time someone had turned to her for solace. Did the girl really think she could find it in an undead predator? The gesture actually touched her unbeating heart so... perhaps she could.

"I know it's a good thing. There are so few of them," Annabel whispered, "and I know he loves me. I'm even a little happy for them but I wanted it to be me. I wanted that in a few years' time but he's already got her."

"You still can," Lillian soothed, turning a little to stroke Annabel's hair tentatively. Her thirst towards the human was barely a tingle in the back of her mind with the dragon's smell saturating his room and bedclothes around her. "I see the way he looks at you, you're first in his heart no matter who else he has a child with. It's a duty he was born into. And yes, it's pleasurable but that doesn't change the fact that it started as a duty. You loved him before any of this, I'm sure he'll give you what you want when you're both ready."

"I know. I know I'm being too emotional but that doesn't make it any easier," Annabel sighed.

"It never does, does it?" the vampire chuckled. "Talk to him."

"Thanks Lillian, I will." Annabel paused to consider for a moment before continuing cautiously. "You know I meant what I said before."

"What?" Lillian asked even though she was pretty sure what Annabel was referring to.

"I don't think I would mind having you as a broodmate, you're not as bad as the bloodthirsty vampire who tried to scare me with her stories when we first met. I can see the little ways you two dance around each other, I won't stand in the way if he wants you too."

Lillian was lost for words.

Yes, she and the dragon had definitely been dancing, perhaps not intentionally but the tension was rife between them. The not so subtle scenting of each other, the sparks they felt between their bodies. The lingering closeness the held under the guise of defence practice.

Yesterday she'd made herself a vow to free herself from the Drow's dominance and have him... Now the girl was giving her permission to do exactly that. Offering her lover up on a silver platter... oh... no, any other sort of platter.

It was a disconcerting to think Annabel was so devoted that she try to fetch another lover for her dragon. The barriers between her and the delicious dragon seemed to be dissolving, she hardly even cared anymore that she would likely fall under his control, addicted by his perfect blood. However, the pact held her firmly in place, at least for the moment.

"Lillian?" Annabel asked, feeling awkward after hearing no response.

"Sorry. I was just thinking how fucked up my situation is, even for a Being. Thank you Annabel, it means something that you would accept me like that, share him. God knows I don't deserve your trust. It can't happen though, Annabel, not in our current situation, it's too dangerous. How about just friends for now?"

"Friends," Annabel confirmed sensing that Lillian didn't want to talk about it further.

The vampire smiled wistfully, she'd initially wondered what the dragon saw in this girl. Now she could see it too. She was sweet, gentle, caring, and selfless. The human was precious and Lillian undertook then and there to protect and guide her as she could.

"And Annabel, if it does by some miracle come to that, my promise still stands, too."

"What promise?"

"I won't steal him from you," whispered the vampire. "I don't think it's possible."

Annabel couldn't help but smile at that.

***

Chris woke with a start, one of those strange moments where it's like you were never asleep at all. He was rested but there was no grogginess or lethargy. His mind was focused, he was going to make sure Annabel woke up in his arms.

There was something warm already in his arms though, a feisty, beautiful dragon.

A pregnant dragon.

He felt a soaring of male pride inside himself and smiled, kissing the top of her head. She'd insisted on sleeping on top of him, it was nice once he'd finally found a position that his wings didn't mind. She was still asleep, her smaller body draped across him, her head on his chest, breathing cutely through her pursed lips.

It already seemed right to have her like that, familiar to him after just one night. Perhaps it was that they were both dragons. More likely however was that they were mated, very successfully one might add.

Against the odds, they had created new life together. His heart fluttered happily at that thought, they were bonded as dragons but he realised he was also feeling for her as a human. There was almost no apprehension at the thought of their child, they'd talked about it last night and there would be plenty of time to grow into their relationship and this ultimate responsibility.

She woke sleepily as he rolled her to the side and wiggled himself out from underneath her beautifully coloured body.

"Don't go baby, it's still dark," she cooed sleepily.

He kneeled beside the couch to stroke her cheek and give her an affectionate peck.

"I'd love to stay but I want to go check on Annabel, we have a thing where I try to be there when she wakes up."

"Mmm. I can see why, lucky girl. I'll have to strike an accord with her about those privileges."

"You can try," Chris chuckled.

"I know she comes first Chris, I don't have an issue with that. I truly hope she and I become close friends, go to her. I'll be waiting to meet her when you two get up."

"I hope you do too, she could use friends in our world. She doesn't want to be just my familiar."

"Can I have a kiss before you go?"

"Of course," smiled Chris, closing again to take her slightly thinned red lips in his purple ones, rubbing their flattened snouts together gently, sharing breath. He watched with his dragon enhanced vision as she closed her eyes and hummed happily in her throat. She looked perfect in the pre-dawn twilight, he felt a little guilty for abandoning her.

The realisation that she was pregnant jumped to the front of his mind again, startling him and making him feel a little giddy, he broke the kiss and lifted the blanket covering her naked body. He snuffled around on her belly, smelling their sex from last night and finally resting his mouth over her womb. He gave her a lingering kiss there between her tiny, defined abs, sending his love towards both her and their child.

Claire sighed contentedly, feeling his presence flush warm and tender around her, his love enveloping them.

Forcing himself to move on, he couldn't help but briefly kiss the top of her perfectly smooth mound, his devilish tongue seemed to have a mind of its own, snaking out and drawing a gasp from her as it wetly brushed over her little love-button.

"Go now or I won't let you leave," Claire huffed.

He snuck out from under the blanket with a culpable smirk, proverbial cookie crumbs smattered on his playful lips.

"Go," she watched him get up and stretch, giving her a full frontal of his impressive body as his wings spread to the side. It made her insides squirm just watching him; his power and strength, the play of muscle under his skin, his dangling, semi firm tackle. She melted as he started walking out of the living room, turning to smile over his shoulder at her. His butt was so cute, too.

She rolled over and replayed the last twelve hours, his magnificent body holding her, taking her, impregnating her. His presence and strength, the way he felt inside her, the way she could almost taste him in the air with her nimble, forked tongue. It felt so right, her body was vibrating with happiness. Grinning, she snuggled back into the couch for a few more hours of happy drowsing.

Chris estimated it was around four or four-thirty as he stood on the porch in the buff. Jethry would be up to milk the cows soon but he wouldn't be getting any help from Chris today.

It was cool but comfortable. He descended the stairs and walked quietly around to the back of the house. He found the garden hose he was looking for and turned the tap, cautiously testing the cold water.

It felt right to be outside with the water shocking and sharpening his body and mind. He cleaned himself as thoroughly as possible without soap, it wasn't so bad once he was used to it and it was certainly very refreshing, better than waking up everyone in the house with noise of the shower.

Dripping dry for a little and shaking his head back and forth, he went back inside and snuck upstairs to the linen closet to grab a towel. Once dry, he left it in the bathroom before finally heading towards his room. Towards Annabel.

Both the dragon and the vampire were startled at the sight of each other. Chris hadn't expected to find Lillian in his room, let alone sleeping face to face with Annabel, cuddling each other. They were clothed and above the covers at least.

Lillian hadn't expected to fall asleep, let alone with her arm draped protectively over the human. She woke almost instantly as he stepped quietly into the room and froze in shock. She definitely hadn't expected to see him stark naked.

They stared at each other for a few seconds, processing.

Lillian couldn't help but admire what she saw. Chris wondered if he'd caught the vampire in a rare moment of vulnerability. He hadn't realised Lillian and Annabel were comfortable enough with each other for the natural embrace he was witnessing.

They suddenly sprang to life, Chris covering his crotch with his hands and rushed over to his drawer to get some boxers while Lillian extracted herself from Annabel and sat up on the edge of the bed with her back turned to him. He got his boxers on hastily and sat down on the opposite side of the bed, looking to see that Annabel was still asleep.

"Sorry," he murmured. "I thought you'd be in the spare room. Thanks for staying with her though. Is she okay?"

Lillian sighed, still collecting herself. She was actually more shaken from waking up like that than seeing him naked. She very seldom slept, never in bed with someone else, no matter who. That wasn't to say she hadn't enjoyed the view she'd just been given, it only reaffirmed her resolution to have him eventually. His rush to clothe himself reemphasised his youth and innocence, characteristics which belied his body. Most of the males she knew would have stood there just to make sure she'd seen it. There was no doubt now that he had exactly what it took to make her squeal.

"She's an incredible young woman," Lillian finally replied quietly as she heard him nervously fidget in his seat. "Don't you dare hurt her, Chris, she's too good for that."

"You think I don't know that?" he choked quietly, turning to look at his fiancé.

"She'll be fine, I think," the vampire replied, sufficiently satisfied with the emotion in his response. "I'm glad you came back now, I'm sure it will mean a lot to her. Congratulations by the way."

"Thanks," He said half-heartedly. "I didn't realise you two were close, I thought she was a bit scared of you."

"I'm just as surprised as you are believe me. We talked a bit last night, she needed some comfort."

"That's good," Chris whispered, his throat felt a little thick with feelings of guilt.

"Anyway, I'll leave you two together. Seriously Chris, I know you love each other and she's accepted you and Susan but having a child with another woman is a big stretch, even if it is to save your species," Lillian stood and made a few steps towards the door.

"She heard, of course she did," Chris stated.

Stopping the vampire to turn back towards him, "Yes."

"Fuck, I should have come up here. I thought she would've come down if she was awake."

"And see you in the arms of another woman, celebrating something she deeply wanted for herself?" Lillian raised an eyebrow.

"I didn't plan that, Lillian," Chris whispered with his head in his hands.

"That doesn't really matter though does it? Not when it happened anyway."

"I'm an idiot," he murmured.

"Maybe a little," she smiled. "But you're young and she forgives you. She knows it's your duty."

Lillian began to walk the final few steps towards the door before pausing again.

"She's gave me permission to be with you too because she thinks that's what you want. That's how devoted to you she is."

"Jesus, Annabel," he breathed before turning to the vampire nervously. "What did you say?"
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 11|
--------------------------------------------
Lillian paused at the portal, not looking back as she spoke in case he somehow saw the lie in her eyes.

"It doesn't matter, Chris. It's never going to happen," she closed the door.

Chris didn't know what to feel about that.

Instead of lingering on it, he picked up Annabel gently and pulled back the covers. She murmured and woke up but he didn't say anything until they were under the covers and he had her up against him in a loving embrace.

She didn't move or acknowledge him, just let him manhandle her silently. She was still wearing yesterday's t-shirt and her short skirt, it stood out to him because they were never not naked in bed together. It seemed symbolic of what he'd just put her through. He hated it.

"I'm sorry," he murmured as she looked up at him in the dim light. She didn't reply. Instead pulling away from his embrace and rolling away from him, moving around under the covers.

Tears began to well in his eyes and his throat thickened painfully, closing off his airways so that he almost gasped. He rolled away from her onto his back as his chest ached, struggling not to sob. He didn't care that his wings were folded uncomfortably beneath him, he'd finally done it, he'd finally made her run from him, just as he'd feared.

It was his own damn fault too. His dragon shrieked pitifully inside his head.

He could still hear her moving a little, assuming she was about to get out of bed and walk away. He shut his eyes so he wouldn't have to see her go.

Her naked skin pushed back against his side and he let out a startled sob, pulling her next to him roughly and crushing her into his chest, panting into her soft hair. He was beyond words with relief. His heart, having been so close to shattering, felt like it began beating again as her comforting smell seeped into his lungs, easing his painful congestion.

He'd feared the worst, jumped to conclusions, but it had given him a precious insight into his world without Annabel.

She struggled a little, perhaps surprised by the intensity of his reaction but he didn't let her go.

"Baby, I can barely breathe," Annabel croaked.

"Sorry," he sniffed, releasing her from his bear hug and wiping away the few tears that had barely escaped.

She sensed something was wrong when he pulled her so closely into his crushing embrace, now the thickness in his voice made her suspicious. Confirmation came when she reached up carefully in the low light and felt his face, a little wet.

"What's wrong, Chris?"

"Nothing Dee, It's just... I thought..." He didn't get a chance to finish as she quickly moved up and ran her tongue over his cheek, collecting his tears.

The emotions trapped in those magical droplets of brine flashed through Annabel's mind. Just like their first day together, in this very same bed, she experienced the intensity of his feelings towards her again. Such heartbreak, loss, and guilt it made her give a strangled groan when he'd stupidly assumed she was getting out of bed. Such relief and love when she'd snuggled back into him. The power of his emotions was overwhelming, creating an out of body experience for a few moments. As it faded away, the afterglow of his happiness lingered a little.

<em>Oh Chris, what am I going to do with you?</em>

She gave him a quick kiss before laying her head on his chest again. He sighed and put his arms back around her, less forcefully this time.

"You're a real turkey sometimes, babe. You know that, right?" She accented her words with a kiss just above his nipple, right over his heart.

"Yes," he snorted. What a thing to say to a guy.

"What did you think, that I'd walk out on us just like that?"

"Maybe. Yes, I guess for a moment. I was worried about how you feel about Claire and I."

"Well that's dumb. I'd be mad right now if I hadn't just felt how broken up about it you were for a few seconds. I said we'd work this stuff out. I love you, I'm not going to go running away. Haven't I proven that already?"

"I'm sorry, Dee. It's pretty much my worst nightmare, I keep thinking I'll do something that makes you snap and walk out. I'm obviously pretty insecure about that, I don't know what I'd do without you."

"Oh baby, I'm fine okay? Yes, I was a bit shaken up when I heard that she was pregnant already. I wanted that to be us in a few years time but it's still a good thing. You're going to be a father and there'll be another beautiful dragon in the world. You have my official permission to make as many dragon babies as you like. That was the entire point of this remember? Your father's sacrifice and Susan's devotion. I was just shocked by the timing, I thought I'd have years to get used to the idea and that we'd probably start trying for our own kids before you ever managed one with Claire. I thought it was supposed to take ages?"

"I thought so too, I don't know what happened."

It was true, he had no explanation for Claire's astoundingly rapid conception.

Annabel just giggled.

"What?" he asked.

"You happened, silly."

"What do you mean?"

"Come on turkey boy, do I have to spell it out for you? Fine. All I'm saying is that it's been established that you're pretty exceptional, even for a dragon. Well, that and a girl could probably get knocked up off half a whiff of..."

"Stop it," he pleaded.

She couldn't help but tease him, laughing at the look she could barely make out on his face in the light that was starting to seep into the room.

"Wow, I think Immi is rubbing off on you, Dee. Seriously though, I don't think virility has much to do with it, we just got really lucky."

"No babe, it's definitely something about you. What is it they say? If you meet a few assholes, that's okay but if everyone you meet is an asshole, it's you who's got the problem. Well this is like that but with the opposite of assholes. Incredible things keep happening around you, Chris, you must be to blame for it."

"An interesting theory, eloquently presented, Miss Somerset," Chris joked with mock seriousness in imitation of what he imagined was an old English gentleman's accent.

"I'm serious!" Annabel complained happily. Then a mischievous smile flickered at the corner of her lips and she stroked a finger teasingly down his smooth, cool flank before she whispered, "Miss Annabel Baryst."

"Hmm," he murmured. "Getting some practice are you?"

"Exactly," She replied. "What's more, I'll pragmatically consider what you just did to Claire practice for what you're going to do to me once we're married."

"Very gracious of you," he said with a provocative stroke of her slim tummy.

"How was it, with... with Claire?" She asked tentatively. "Did you even bother talking to her?"

"It was great. We did it a bunch of times, mostly quite vigorously with our dragons taking the lead but we also had a few more mellow goes. Our dragons seem to be a great match for each other. She also... well her... let's just say I got a lesson on some dragon biology I wasn't aware of. And yes, we had some time to talk too. She's eager to meet you."

"You gonna' tell me about it?" she asked with a playful wiggle against him.

He responded by tracing lazy circles and figure eights on her lower back, making her shiver even more.

"Maybe later, you don't need to hear the gruesome details right now. What I really want to say is that once again you've amazed me. I love you, Dee. Perhaps I don't deserve you, but I love you. I couldn't have foreseen that Claire would get pregnant but I certainly don't regret it. She's my mate now too but that doesn't change how I feel about you one bit. I've already told her that you're my First, that you'll always come first."

"I know that, Chris, I love you too."

They were silent several long moments, just enjoying the contact between their bodies and the love between their souls.

"By the way, Lillian mentioned that you gave her approval to come after me. What's up with that?"

"Oh, that whole thing. I don't know Chris, I guess I like her. I can see that there's tension between the two of you. She's strong on the outside but I can tell she's so lonely. When you're not looking she stares at you like she's longing to reach out and touch but something's holding her back. I told her I wouldn't stand in the way if that's what you both wanted."

Silence dominated again as Chris collected his thoughts.

"I'm not really sure what to say, Dee, yeah I guess there's been a bit of chemistry between us but I think most of what you're seeing is her instinct to feed. She must have a really hard time with it around me. I still can't believe Reyla assigned her to me, she must have known it would be terrible for her. Anyway, yes, she's very beautiful and yes, she excites me but I don't think it's meant to be."

"It's not just her instinct to feed Chris, trust me. And all I was saying was that if she does like you, I won't try to stop her. She's stunning and I like her, even if she is a bit scary sometimes. You could do a lot worse."

"Are you sure you're not a time traveller from the sixties or something? What's with all the free loving?"

"Peace and freedom, baby," Annabel snorted.

Chris considered a real reply for a few more moments.

"I don't have some master plan that keeps dropping women in my lap Dee. It just seems to happen and soon enough my dragon starts caring for them and loving them before I'm even aware of it. It creeps up on me so quickly. It happened like that with Susan and I can already feel it starting to happen with Immi and Claire. I guess it's a little bit like that with Lillian but we're holding ourselves back because it could be so dangerous."

"That's okay Chris. I signed up for this and I love it, I love you. Bridges baby, bridges."

"If nothing else, you are a champion bridge crosser," he chuckled appreciatively into her scalp before planting an appreciative, loving kiss.

***

Annabel and Chris ended up sleeping through dawn and several hours into the early morning. Even after they woke up, they spent a half hour lying in bed, mostly just staring at each other and enjoying the warmth and closeness.

With Chris holding her like that, facing each other on their sides, stroking gently up and down her ribs and over her hip with a finger; her insides turned into dark, creamy, melted chocolate.

His dragon responded to their relaxed state and released its hold on his physical form, his reptilian features faded rapidly until there were just two humans lying snuggled in bed.

Finally they got up and Annabel sauntered after him for a fairly straight forward shower. His faithful morning pride was conspicuously absent, making her comment that he must be all worn out. His dragon promptly had him to rise to the occasion just to prove a point but overall there was very little sexy business other than an occasional wet grope or a soap-slicked tweak.

She did however, insist on having her hair washed by him, her morning pampering was becoming a ritual she wouldn't easily give up. Chris didn't mind at all, taking any excuse to get close to a wet, naked Annabel and make her coo in pleasure.

Once they were done, they dressed in some of Chris's old stuff and came downstairs hand in hand to find, as they'd expected, everyone up and waiting for them.

Susan was preparing breakfast on the stove, ready for the day wearing a nice snug pair of jeans and a waist-clinging long-sleeved blouse. A nice little yellow apron protected her from her work. She was heating pans and whipping up some eggs when she saw them enter.

By the looks of it, Immi was being a bit of a pest, flitting around Susan as she tried to cook, sampling things before they were anywhere near done and offering a lot of unrequested advice.

"Finally," Susan said in that tone unique to mothers which conveyed love, annoyance, and humour all at the same time. "I was about to send Lillian upstairs with a glass of water to pour over you two."

Chris rolled his eyes and pulled Annabel close against his side, bringing her around the kitchen island to introduce her to Petra.

The statuesque dragoness was looking up from her Maginet tablet to study them.

"Annabel, this is Petra. Petra this is my fiancé, Annabel," Chris intoned politely just as Susan had taught him all those years ago. The two women shook hands firmly, the chestnut brown and the platinum blond assessing each other.

"It's nice to meet you," Annabel spoke when the moment became a little unreadable.

"Likewise, Annabel. And may I just say that I can see exactly why he fell in love with you," Petra smiled, reading the human with her magical senses and seeing almost uncorrupted goodness, not to mention the human's slender but very attractive figure.

"Thanks," Annabel replied. "You're very beautiful yourself."

"Oh hush now," Petra scolded. "Talk like that will go straight to my ego. And we dragons are notorious for being at least a little self-worshiping, aren't we? I'd like to apologise to you though, about the timing of our joyous news. I know you haven't had much time with him yet but..."

"It's fine," interrupted Annabel. "I talked with Chris about it this morning. I understand how wonderful and extraordinary the conception of a new dragon is and I'm happy. Happy for all of us."

"Oh dear, you are a perfect First. Thank you for accepting this and for finding and loving him before we ever could," Petra got up to embrace Annabel in a warm hug, given on behalf of every dragon, before relinquishing her back to Chris and turning to Susan. "And you, Susan, I don't know how we can repay you for your bravery. Claire explained some of what Chris told her. We have so much to thank you for."

"You're welcome, Petra, but I think he's all the reward I'll ever want," Susan said mushily from the stove as she blew a kiss at him.

"He's blushing," Petra whined girlishly, an act not befitting her species, age, or power but incredibly sexy nonetheless.

It only made Chris's circulation problems worse so he pulled up a chair and sat to watch Susan slaving over the stove in her little apron.

Annabel plopped into his lap a moment later and whispered up into his ear.

"You can give me some long, hard reward later."

With their backs turned, everyone in the kitchen didn't notice anything unusual about the sounds of approaching footfalls from the living room. It wasn't until Chris felt firm breasts pressed into his back and the sensation of stiff nipples, too firm to be separated by more than just his shirt, that he realised Claire was still naked.

"I want some more reward too," she cooed seductively in his other ear even as Annabel pulled back in shock, leaning away in his lap.

Their eyes met, ruby versus doe-brown for a second before Annabel's began to track over the naked, scarlet and white body. Claire took the opportunity to flounce around into the kitchen actual and fetch a glass of water for herself from the sink, her hips swaying and her toned, draconian perfection on display.

<a>Annabel wasn't quite sure what to think other than it was a bit of a bitch move. Strutting around naked</a> in front of everyone and clearly trying to get a rise out of Chris. A new firmness under her lap seemed to indicate that it might be working too.

Regardless, she was beautiful. Her half form was majestic, it made Annabel think of a sports model or a gymnast. She had that soft muscle definition that Annabel used to envy before she became comfortable with her burgeoning body, yet still looked absolutely feminine and particularly squishy and taught where it counted.

After seeing Chris in his half dragon perfection, she realised this was his natural counterpart. Claire's wings and colouring made her so exotic too, like one of those renders of too-beautiful science fiction women you come across occasionally on the internet. Annabel was tempted to feel jealousy for a moment before realising there was just no point. Chris needed to be with other dragons, it wasn't their fault that they were beautiful together.

Claire enjoyed her little show, trying to excite him, waltzing back around to sit in the chair next to her mate. He was now surrounded with Petra on the other side. His first, Annabel was staring form her prized perch on his lap, her head now resting under his chin.

"Hi," Claire started, unsure how to make the moment any less awkward.

"Hi, Claire," Annabel replied.

"I ah... I wanted say thanks for letting him be with me and sorry for sketching out yesterday. He overwhelmed me a bit and my dragon took over."

"It's okay, Claire, I can definitely understand that," Annabel smiled, having a little flashback to the first time she'd encountered the dragon. "I trust it went very well between you given the happy outcome?"

Everyone else in the room had paused to watch the exchange, to see how the two women would settle; Chris was barely breathing as he held Annabel.

"Oh my god, yes! I hate that I waited sixty four years to have sex! What a waste. Well, okay maybe about 42 years because I was too young but whatever. I can't believe I'm pregnant, I keep checking every other minute just to be sure."

"He was your first?" Annabel was surprised, she'd assumed that someone like Claire would be a sexual dynamo.

"Um... yeah," Claire looked sideways, obviously embarrassed about it.

Annabel quickly realised there was a woman in there with the sexy dragoness, she'd felt those same insecurities herself not too long ago, still struggled with them now.

"Me too," Annabel replied.

"He told me you awakened him on your first time together? That's so romantic, you're lucky."

"Yeah, it was awesome," Annabel's tone was getting friendlier and Chris began to release his pent up breath quietly. Annabel sighed in return, "You're having a child with him though."

"I never thought it would happen straight away, I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry about that," Annabel reassured. "I already told Chris to have as many dragon babies as he can. All I really want is a few human ones of my own someday."

Claire lurched forwards to hug Annabel tightly, almost pulling her out of Chris's lap with her busty embrace.

"You'll have as many as you want and until then, you can help me with mine. Thank you, Annabel."

Annabel relaxed into the hug, feeling somehow more sisterly than competitive and not understanding why.

"Claire, don't take this the wrong way or anything but... I don't hate you. I thought I might but I don't."

"I know. It's him, he's somehow doing this to us," Claire whispered back.

"Doesn't that worry you? I mean, don't you want to fight it?" asked Annabel.

"No."

"Me either but um... you're naked."

They broke apart smiling, an understanding had been formed. They might not have much in common, mightn't have similar backgrounds or even be the same species. What they did share however was deep love and devotion for the man right next to them. Perhaps that would be enough to bring them closer together.

"You'd better put some clothes on. Jethry will be coming for breakfast and there's no telling what he'll do if he sees tits," Annabel warned as Claire's naked body assaulted her eyes again.

"I tore mine up yesterday," Claire admitted sheepishly.

"And I suppose you don't want to brave the outdoors to go get your bag form the car?" Petra smiled over at her daughter, pleased that the encounter with Annabel had gone so well. "Oh fine, I'll get it. Play nice now girls and Claire, go have a shower."

"It's not that bad, is it?" Claire asked Annabel conspiratorially.

"Like a brothel," giggled Annabel.

Claire gasped in mock hurt before giving Annabel a wink and following her mother out of the kitchen, off to find the shower and wash away the residues of her mating.

"Well, that couldn't have gone any better," Chris finally breathed easy.

"Yes, that was very big of you, Annabel, I'm proud," Susan came over and gave her quick hug.

"It was easy," Annabel explained. "I think I like her."

***

Michelle thought things were going well. She'd been on her own for a full two and a half days now and nothing had eaten her or even gripped her heel from the shadows as she descended any of the open stepped staircases in the Compound.

Her job involved a lot of sitting and listening. Listening to immensely powerful creatures voice their insecurities and problems about being exposed in broad daylight to humans. It was ironic, they were scared of the very people they looked down on as inferior. Perhaps it was always the way with the individually powerful and the masses.

It had gotten better and better since that first emergency Synod meeting at least. Now there was less unconstructive fear mongering or bickering and more discussion of real issues.

How would the general populous be managed to avoid widespread panic?

How would Beings mesh into human society and what rights and laws would apply to them?

How would they convince governments around the globe to go ahead with a worldwide revelation without one of them spilling the beans or outright declaring war?

These were the big questions. Michelle brainstormed, scribbled, and took notes furiously whenever they were the focus of the conversation.

She'd been with Reyla for several days now, had gotten used to the dark elf's moods and so far managed to avoid her permanently simmering temper. She did seem a little subdued since Chris had received that nasty burn a couple days ago, though.

They held video conferences twice daily for several hours. During which she would be called on occasionally to give opinions or suggestions but mostly she was trying to record what it was that Beings hoped to gain from this. What terms would make the Revelation acceptable to them?

She also talked extensively with members of the growing team working on the human end of things. Helping to organise the initiation of the Being Interaction Agency was one of her main duties. Yes, there were plenty of jokes about its acronym but somehow it was sticking. As well as that, filling in some of gaps in human knowledge or quashing misunderstandings when it came to Beings was a vital part of her role, one she was uniquely qualified for.

The rest of her day might be taken up with researching and educating herself about Beings in general. Reyla sometimes helped but tended not to have much patience so Michelle turned to whoever was available, mostly Timothy Garrill.

The head of security had taken her under his wing and escorted her around the compound whenever she needed a guide. It was convenient for both because he liked to be present for most of the meetings that went on and he could conduct most of his duties over the phone if he was helping Michelle in the library or answering her questions.

They'd grown to like each other quickly, recognising dutiful professionalism and a passion for the good morals behind the law. The elemental was astounded that she'd acclimatised to life as a familiar so quickly, it was obvious she had dedicated herself to seeing the revelation through and making sure it was a success for both sides.

Michelle enjoyed her independence but the massive hotel suite seemed empty at night. Things tended to catch up to her in those lonely nights. The death of her team, her friends, at the betrayal of a Being she'd once called an ally. She even had trouble sleeping, tossing restlessly as her mind refused to shut down and let her rest, keeping her up an extra hour or two every night with a simmering rage that made her throat feel thick and clogged.

She missed being able to talk to Susan and Annabel candidly in the relative privacy of the suite. She especially missed the dragon, being able to take comfort from his presence and strength and know that he was there to support her, to back her up like he'd done in her integration just days ago. Even having him hover near her, assuring himself she was okay or that she didn't need anything.

That feeling of dependence was a shock in and of its self. She considered herself, at least previously, to be a strongly independent person. It was strange that she now had someone to lean on even if it was a forced arrangement, it was even stranger that she liked it.

At night, she tried to rationalise these feelings into something that made sense to her analytical mind. Perhaps being thrust into this new world and bound to him as a familiar had actually changed her. Honestly, she knew better. With what she'd learned about dragons recently the answer was obvious. It was his magic. But what could she, a mere human do about that?

Whatever her emotions and their origins were, she recognised that she was now in the right place to do the most good, for both sides. She could be thankful for that at the very least.

On the afternoon of the day everyone was due back from Laramie, Michelle was quite nervous. That morning there had been a full video meeting of available Synod, territory leaders, human government officials, and pertinent staff.

The president was there as well as the prime minister of the U.K. and the German chancellor. They'd discussed many issues, making good progress on setting up infrastructure around the globe to deal with the revelation.

That was all well and good. What made Michelle nervous was a suggestion by one of the president's staff that as part of the effort to maintain calm and help put the public's mind at ease, they should prepare in advance, media packages portraying real Beings in a positive light. These dossiers could then be released however it was deemed appropriate. Someone even suggested television advertisements and detailed interviews or documentary miniseries. When the time came, it was hoped that this would raise awareness without promoting panic or hysteria.

Someone even thought that after the revelation, having certain Beings available to the public would be vital to help connect the two societies. They would create opportunities for humans to see Beings or access information about them in a controlled manor, so that misinformation and rumour didn't run too rampant.

The few media experts present loved these ideas, perhaps seeing dollars signs already as they had the scoop on what was going to be the biggest event of the millennia. The problem was, they latched on like rabid terriers and it appeared they wouldn't easily let go.

In fact, everyone seemed to like the idea, and so did Michelle, until the President piped up and said that Chris would be his first choice as the subject of such a campaign.

"An upright, good looking, young American like Christopher is perfect for the role. He's a dragon too, which I understand makes him likeable, if not loveable," were Robert Falconer's exact words.

There were several smirks about that.

"I don't know if that is such a good idea," John Guthrie had replied reasonably. "He is very young and it would put him under a lot of pressure, let alone expose him to further potential dangers. He is the future of our race after all."

"Nonsense," the haughty Fairy Queen rebutted, her tiny calculating smile could easily be seen across the video connection. "He is a perfect candidate. Have you not been spouting that older beings are the most problematic, having lost touch with humanity?"

John Guthrie could not counter that point easily for he had indeed, with good reason, expressed his concerns about older, generally more powerful Beings taking to the terms of the Revelation less easily.

However, Michelle remembered that the fairy representative had seemed to be one of the most indignant Synod members when Chris had effectively overridden their authority only days before. Her concerns were only validated when a blond elf, her least favourite Synod member, spoke in support Chris' nomination. The same elf who had lobbied for destroying her mind after her initial interrogation.

It had then been quickly agreed upon and Reyla had ignored a concerned, meaningful look from Michelle, leaving her unsure of the drow's intentions towards the dragon. Before she could muster any real protest, the job of informing Chris of his involvement fell heavily in her lap.

As his familiar, of course she was the best suited to break the news to him they'd reasoned. As she'd looked around the video screens for any form of help, only Lord Guthrie gave her an apologetic look through the connection.

Michelle had to admit though, he was perfect for it.

Young and only recently a Being, he still connected strongly with his human roots and could relate to modern humans in ways that some of the ancient Beings could never manage. He was kind, only a little introverted, generally happy, and yes, he was good looking. It seemed like he had no desire for fame, which made him even more suited to the role.

Her mind mulled this over on her walk 'home.' The thing was, this could actually work in Chris' favour.

Therefore, as she approached the apartment at the end of the day, expecting to find that they had arrived back already, she was a fretful about breaking the news of his predetermined involvement.

When she stepped out of the elevator however, the activity at the other end of the hallway took her attention. Her training instantly kicked into assessment mode. It appeared someone had moved into the other guest suite; the new occupants were in the process of leaving to go somewhere.

As she continued down the hall towards the door to Chris' apartment and the women approached from the opposite direction, her suspicions grew. The timing was too fortuitous and these beautiful ladies seemed to match the general description she'd been given by Timothy. A mature, tall platinum blond and a young athletic redhead; both with refined, stunning features and perhaps an air of coolness or distance.

But if they had moved in next door already, that meant...

"Hello, Michelle," the young redhead greeted her as Michelle held her key card at the ready.

"Hi, ..."

"Claire, Chris told us about you," Claire supplied. "This is my Mom, Petra."

Everyone shook hands.

"I see. And you've taken the other room... so that means?" asked Michelle tentatively.

They didn't seem cold or aloof, in fact they both seemed to be vibrating happily, perhaps it was because they knew she was his familiar.

"Yes! We're mated," Claire emphasised with an excited bounce on her toes. Her fiery ponytail bouncing around as well as other body parts.

"She's pregnant too, but we're keeping that under wraps for a few days," Petra leaned closer to whisper conspiratorially.

"Pregnant!" spluttered Michelle before her hands reached to cover her gaping mouth. "Oh, sorry... Pregnant? Already? Annabel said it takes years for you to... you know."

"Yes! That's why this is so wonderful," Clair said. "Come on, let's go in so we can talk. I want you to fill me in on your life. Chris said you worked for the NSA and now you're involved in the Revelation. I'd love to hear all about that."

"Give her a break, Claire, it looks like she's had a long day," said Petra.

"It's okay," Michelle assured as she swiped the card and opened the thick, heavy door. "It's nice to have someone to talk to and perhaps you two could help educate me a bit more about Beings. I've been told I'm doing well for having only been truly exposed to your world for a few days now but sometimes it feels like I'm floundering."

She held the door and the two dragons stepped inside before she shut it and checked the lock.

"Of course, Michelle. Ask me for help any time, you're doing a huge service with your involvement," Petra replied.

"I don't know about that," Michelle was a little embarrassed.

"Nonsense," spoke Chris from the end of the foyer. "She's been great."

There was an awkward moment when Chris and Michelle approached each other. For a moment it looked like they might shake hands but Chris opened his arms tentatively and Michelle eagerly took his invitation to a hug.

"Was everything fine while we were gone? I was worried about..."

"Chris," Michelle interrupted him. "Do you remember when I arrested you with a S.W.A.T. team?"

"Well, yeah, of course," he didn't get where she was going with this.

"I can look out for myself, though I appreciate the sentiment."

"You have a point," Chris smiled, releasing her and giving Claire and Petra a nod of acknowledgement. "You'll have to hear that story in full some time, I'm still sure Michelle was tempted to clock me."

"Is that stir-fry I smell?" Michelle's nose provided a timely distraction.

"Yes," Chris replied, "Annabel and Susan are teaming up for dinner so it should be great."

"Now there's something I actually missed while you were gone, good cooking," Michelle threw back at him.

"I know," Petra agreed. "Annabel sure can cook and Susan is no slouch either."

They all sauntered into the kitchen, congregating around the kitchen bar while the two cooks busily scuttled around each other and fragrant steam belched from the cookware they worked over.

Petra explained that she was pleasantly surprised with their guest accommodation, and while it wasn't as lavish as their home in San Diego, it would do nicely.

This made Chris feel his country roots strongly for a moment, to him, Reyla's guest quarters were classier than anything he'd ever experienced. What must the two dragonesses have thought of the farmhouse they'd just left? Hopefully, it didn't fall anywhere lower than being described as "quaint."

He was soon distracted however when Claire sidled up behind him were he sat watching his two lovely cooks at work. She wrapped her arms around him, sniffling against his neck and letting out a contented, animalistic croon that was somehow both a little disturbing and incredibly arousing.

Claire rubbed herself against him like a cat, savouring his lovely scent and meeting his lips with her own as he turned to look at her. She kissed her mate passionately, feeling her heart swell and her core moisten as their tongues teasingly met in her mouth.

"What about you? Are you happy to get back to civilization?" Chris asked as she bit her lower lip provocatively after their kiss.

"Yes, it's nice to be back in a decent city but your farm wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It was just too quiet all the time. I guess I'm just a city girl at heart. But, what I'm not happy about is that I have to settle for living down the hall."

"Well Michelle needs a room and Lillian and Susan have the other two, I don't really see a way around it, sorry, Claire."

"Mmmm," She smiled, perhaps he didn't realise she was toying with him. He was so cute sometimes. "I could sleep on the couch, or on the floor but maybe you're right... It could be best if I'm in the other apartment, I'll just have to steel you away to my lair in the middle of the night while Annabel's asleep."

Chris looked a little poleaxed for a moment before frowning and realising she was probably winding him up.

"Well, either that or I just sleep with you and Annabel," she laughed. "Think about it."

"Dinner's ready!" Annabel called, having overheard only snippets of their conversation but judging by the blush on Chris's face, she knew Claire had discovered one of her own favourite hobbies... making him squirm. She shot a tentative smile at the stunning redhead, who returned it eagerly.

Annabel was still coming to terms with having Claire fawning over her future husband but over the last few days on the farm, they'd developed a genuinely friendly and sometimes even playful rapport, united in their devotion to both the purple dragon and the slightly dorky, caring young man.

Susan bustled them all into the dinning room and took her place at what was quickly becoming a more and more crowded table.

Dinner was indeed a spicy delight. Annabel's tender beef and crisp fresh vegetables simmered with a perfect blend of garlic, ginger, and sesame had the compliments flowing and several asking for seconds. Instead of adding traditional chilli, Susan insisted that Annabel incorporate a small amount of fireroot that she'd brought back from their trip home to the farm. It magically attuned itself to be however spicy the eater desired after a short incantation on the witch's part.

Susan had also made a delicious berry cobbler for desert and while they ate, Michelle filled them all in on the latest news about the Revelation. Perhaps the biggest was that there had indeed been a few incidents where Beings had breached the bridging regulations put in place by the council just a few days ago.

As Lillian had predicted, vampires were the offenders.

Michelle said that the Synod had been angling for several hundred years imprisonment but the vampire representative had insisted that execution was the only way to make a firm example, given that three humans had lost their lives to the stupidity and disrespect of a couple upstart vampires. An example needed to be made.

Michelle wasn't entirely sure how the humans took this news but there could be no doubt that the Synod acted swiftly and with a heavy hand. It was clear that their resolve to meet the human's conditions for equality in the value of life was firm, at least when it came to the lives of their lower subjects. Perhaps it was more about flexing their own muscles and making sure Beings knew they were serious.

Waiting in the wings of the ensuing conversations about vampire hierarchy, Michelle finally worked up the courage to broach the subject she was dreading.

"It doesn't really matter if you believe all life has equal value, Annabel," Lillian explained. "Despite the moral flaws and pitfalls you come across in discussing the value of life, let alone when you add ancient, powerful Beings to the equation. A Vampire of less than 100 years is more a wild animal more than a person. None of you can understand how severe the cravings can be and how seductive the beast within us is. Only the strongest learn to control their instincts and even then we live balanced on a knife edge sometimes. The girl Amanda's attack on Chris is a perfect example of this. All vampires must be treated with a heavy hand, for deep down, that is all our inner beast understands.

Everyone was a bit sobered after that explanation and in the thoughtful silence that followed, Michelle pounced.

"Well, on the human side, today some of our media guys brought up an interesting idea. They want to prepare media packages portraying real Beings and humans positively together and have them ready to go when we're all set for the reveal. Short clips for TV add slots, detailed interviews, and even documentaries."

"Ooo, that sounds like a great idea," Annabel enthused. "People will gobble that sort of stuff up, even if it is a little propagandaey, especially younger people. They will just want as much information as possible."

"Yeah, the idea could work well in theory," Michelle continued with a nervous glance towards Chris who was thankfully busy with the last of his dessert. "There was even talk of having limited meet and greet opportunities for the human population to interact with Beings in a relatively controlled environment. The President really likes the idea. Of course, he says you need to get the right Beings involved."

A loud clatter from the head of the table startled most everyone momentarily as Chris' spoon dropped onto his bowl and a morsel of cobbler executed a lazy flop onto the table top. Chris sat frozen bolt upright, hand half way towards his moth.

"What's wrong, dear?" Susan asked.

He ignored her as he pierced his latest familiar with a surprisingly steely gaze.

Michelle tried not to squirm but after a few seconds she couldn't help a little fidget escaping her hips, then she couldn't stop herself look away.

<em>Damn those eyes of his!</em>
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 13|
--------------------------------------------
"No," he simply stated.

Annabel, Claire, and Susan looked befuddled but Petra and Lillian, having had more experience with Being politics quickly connected the dots.

"I'm sorry, Chris. If it helps, I wasn't involved in the decision. At least John objected but the Synod overruled him. I thought it was a terrible idea too, at least to begin with," Michelle apologised.

"That's because it IS a terrible idea," Lillian hissed.

"I won't do it," Chris was adamant, anger rising inside him like billowing smoke. "If this is some sort of petty revenge for what happened with the Synod the other day, they can shove it right up their asses."

"Wait, they want Chris to do it?" Annabel caught up.

"Yes, and you can be sure that it is aimed as a punishment," Lillian said. "If not a round-about death sentence."

"There's just no way I'm agreeing to that. The publicity would ruin all our lives and put us in so much danger it isn't even remotely funny. I'm about to be a father for Christ's sake," Chris' dragon was becoming startlingly unsettled as his mind raced. He was being backed into a corner, choices taken away from him. He couldn't do this, he wasn't strong enough to protect them if this was forced upon him.

Immianthe fluttered out of his bedroom into the dining room just then, stifling a tiny yawn after being awoken by the kerfuffle.

"Master, what's wrong? You're making ripples in the Ether," The sprite murmured.

Chris just grunted in frustration, his mind busy trying to come up with ways to get out of this.

"Sorry, Immi. Look, everyone just calm down and listen to me for a second," Michelle pleaded. "I was worried about it too to begin with and I know it will expose you all to danger, even me. Just think about it though. Chris, you're actually perfect for the role and I'm sure that's what the President was thinking when he put your name forward, not out of malice."

"I don't care if your President is in love with him, it's my job to keep him safe," Lillian smouldered.

"Exactly! Everyone knows it will expose him so he's going to have the best protection money and magic can buy," Michelle countered. "Chris is a dragon, he's young and newly a Being, he's powerful, handsome, and he's already in a healthy relationship with a human. He can relate to regular humans because he was one not so long ago. He's also kind and good-natured. It doesn't get any better than <a>that for this role, you'd have to be blind not to see that."</a>

"Let's put aside the direct danger of all the crazy's out there knowing exactly who and what I am for a minute," Chris muttered dangerously. "You want me to become some sort of poster boy? Our life stories would effectively be turned into entertainment. How are we supposed to live our lives?"

"Chris, don't you see? If you play this right, you'll be able to live your life however you damn well please," Michelle begged.

That caused a long pause.

"What do you mean?" he asked warily.

Michelle looked around the room, trying to judge the level of support she could find, surprised that only Annabel wasn't looking at her distrustfully.

"I meant what I said. Think movie star meets politician. If you use this to your advantage and navigate whatever hurdles come up along the way, you will gain neigh untouchability on both sides of the Revelation. You'll be able to name your price and use this to slingshot yourself into any career or position you can dream of. Yes, everyone will know you and some people might try to target you but there are people out there right now who deal with that every day because with worldwide influence and recognition, comes immense power."

"Not to mention that we'll be doing some good for everyone, Being and Human," Annabel added quietly.

"Have you two lost it?!" Chris exploded. He couldn't help feeling incredulous, surrounded, and betrayed. It showed in his tone. "It's bad enough that Beings want to dice me up to use in spells, you want to put a bulls eye on my forehead for every nut and religious freak out there who I guaran-fucking-tee you will think I'm some sort of devil-spawn once this comes out."

Something about this triggered Michelle. Where had her confident, self-assured dragon gone? The dragon who had stood up to the most powerful conglomerate of Beings on the planet in her defence? It made her so angry. Couldn't he see that sacrifice on the personal level was exactly what it would take to make the Revelation work at all. He was in flight, she needed fight.

"Listen to yourself," she scoffed, not considering the words as they spilled from her mouth. "Buck it up, cowboy! All that shit is going to happen anyway when this comes out. You were what? Going to bury your head in the sand? This is an opportunity. Christ! Who'd have thought a dragon could be such a pussy!"

"Michelle!" Petra warned from across the table as she felt the stirrings of a vast amount of energy coming from the boy.

"No!" Michelle snapped. "He needs to hear this. This was always going to be hard, Chris! Everyone has to give up something to make it work. Think of my colleagues who lost their lives for this. I almost lost mine as well, and instead I was basically committed into slavery! What are you willing to give?!"

There was a solid second of pure silence as everyone held their breath and all eyes turned towards Chris.

Michelle's hand rose to cover her mouth, her mind catching up to her tongue and attempting to stem the flow. What was wrong with her?

The air shimmered around him, sizzling as if sitting above black-top on a summers day. He wasn't conscious of how much energy he was drawing. He felt trapped, backed into a corner and attacked by unseen dangers. His dragon raged, they weren't strong enough to protect their Brood. Not with this shoved upon them, not like this.

A collective gasp broke the silence at the dinner table as he simply disappeared in front of their eyes, a deep, sad growl the only trace he left behind, echoing in the room.

Everyone turned back to Michelle, who shrunk in her chair under the intense and varied emotions she saw in the eyes of the other women. Compassion, rage, sadness, disbelief, and most surprisingly, a delighted twinkle.

The high-pitch melody of the sprite's giggle broke the silence.

"Good work, human," Immianthe squeaked as she fluttered her wings in preparation to follow her master. "Silly dragon, he needed that. Fear not sisters, I will go to him!"

<em>Hi folks,</em>

***

Between fight and flight, Chris was indeed in flight. Well, free fall, anyway. He plunged downward through grey nothingness, nebulous swirls of thicker shadow occasionally illuminated in passing by his purple aura.

Anger, fear, and frustration had taken him into the Ether whilst a fierce internal debate raged between his dragon instincts and his human fears.

Michelle's words were simply the trigger, the proverbial straw on top of his ever-growing burden of responsibility. Responsibility to protect and provide whilst his once simple goals in life were thrown to the wind and he found himself inexplicably involved in world changing events. In short, Chris was afraid. He wanted nothing more than to retreat from it all, to take his brood someplace safe and ride this out, even if that was the cowardly, ignorant thing to do.

His dragon had different ideas. Strength was the key to staying alive, to protecting his loved ones. Burying one's head in the sand would only work if everyone left them alone. To truly make sure that he and his beloved brood were truly safe, they must embrace their rightful power together. Too long had dragon kind been hunted. Too long had greed and short-sightedness dominated both human and Being society. Something needed to be done, they needed to help. What sort of world did he want his children to inherit?

They needed to grow stronger and Chris needed to embrace his non-human heritage rather than babble his toe in every now and then. Objectively, Chris knew his dragon was right but it still scared him. It took only a few more moments of slightly gentler coaxing and encouragement, the dragon promising guidance and friendship, a sharing of his burden. Chris ceded control, fully this time, trusting the dragon.

He merged back into the Norm. An ominous crackle of purple energy heralded his sudden arrival, tendrils of raw magic leaping between thin air molecules in a raucous flash.

A chill shiver racing up his spine was the first sensation he noticed. It was bracing but also exhilarating, it felt right. With detached curiosity, his eyes opened. He was high, high above an enormous range of snow-covered mountains, with the ocean to his left. Something buffeted him lightly as he fell, gaining speed now outside of the Ether. The air was so thin it only whispered around him. It didn't really bother Chris though, he was in the back seat and his dragon had firm control of the wheel. Trust; if they were to be one, they must trust each other.

Clear membranes slid into position across his eyes, protecting him from the thickening atmosphere as they dove earthward.

It was night but from this high up, he could see a golden glow on the western horizon.

The curve of the world stretched away to either side but was becoming flatter as he plummeted, his wings swept back like a falcon, striving for swiftness. Magic began to well up from within, the dragon burning it like a volatile fuel, sacrificing it to produce speed. He shared in the dragon's delight, their first real flight together. Now he was going too fast, way faster than terminal velocity. Instead of being cool, the air fought them, becoming warm and thick, behaving more like a syrup as they battered their way groundward. At this speed it seemed like he'd hit the ground in a matter of seconds.

Something swept up at him from the ground like an angry hornet. It raced directly towards him, leaving a barely visible hazy trail in its wake. At the last moment, the dragon contemptuously rolled to the right, narrowly avoiding the fast but less manoeuvrable object which swept past with a snarl.

Chris thought the whole thing very unusual in a removed sort of way but gave it no more thought as the approaching land marks registered in his memory. The Alaskan Peninsula stretching out into the ocean to his left. Below him, a long lake surrounded by great snowy peaks spread out, his enhanced vision let him see every detail even as he approached with unnerving speed.

He began to worry as he dropped level to the tops of the mountains, the rich conifer forest taking over from snow and scree on the great slopes. If he ditched into the lake at this velocity, it would all be over in a flash.

His dragon had other plans and his wings gradually extended. Little by little, his headlong dive turned into a glide. Wing membranes shuddered, his muscles burned under the tremendous load as speed shed and he flattened out. His whole body strained and his back burned from the effort. For several moments, all he could hear was the angry howl of the air he so rudely disturbed, reverberating harshly down the great valley. With mere moments before impact, they levelled off, body shaking in relief. It felt joyous though. The pleasure of flight was a pure, instinctual draw and the dragon made sure that his first real experience would not be forgotten.

A bellowing roar issued unbidden from his throat as he finally soared above the still, dark water. It felt too loud to have come from him, but somehow triumphant, defiant.

Low he swooped, almost caressing the water. In fact, an extended splash and an unfamiliar, cold sensation shooting right up from the base of his spine caused him to sweep his neck around in surprise. There, slicing the water and creating a small wake behind him, was a tail.

Things got weird pretty quickly after that.

He had it all wrong; his neck wasn't flexible enough to look down and back like that. His wings seemed much too big stretched out to either side. He balked, suddenly feeling dizzy, faintly nauseous. His mind questioned for familiar responses but in a body so foreign, many did not connect correctly. This body felt deeply alien and it was a very unsettling feeling.

In an attempt to calm his discomfort, the dragon relinquished some of his control, sharing the reigns with the confused young man. It would be a lengthy process for Chris to adjust. Unfortunately, Chris was not at all prepared for even the slightest role in managing flight. The strange sensations from novel nerve connections intensified, overloading his already struggling brain. His vision darkened, flight faltering, mind retreating. It was his human consciousness that needed to adjust. Indeed, in this form, even his brain was structurally very different.

Thankfully, the dragon was there to catch him. They weren't far from the lake's edge now so the mighty creature flared his great wings with two stalling flaps before plummeting into the black, frigid lake.

***

Back in Denver, everyone was still at the table. They were processing the harsh words and Chris' sudden departure but it seemed no one wanted to speak first.

Michelle's phone practically blew up, startling everyone and breaking the silent stalemate.

She mumbled a curse and picked it up off the table, looking at the caller ID. She grimaced; she really didn't want to answer right now but this was her high priority ringtone.

"Hello?" Michelle's mood did not improve as she listened to Robert Falconer splutter apoplectically for a few moments before gasping and standing from the table. He proceeded to recount that somehow, a purple, fully fledged, forty-five foot dragon had narrowly avoided being shot down over Alaska.

She tried to explain the argument between herself and Chris. That he felt cornered into this involvement in the Revelation and unready to face the dangers and responsibilities. Heated words had been exchanged and he had dramatically disappeared.

However, there was a disconnection between said argument, the deployment of a three and a half million-dollar surface to air missile, and the satellite images President Falconer was looking at of a very large reptile resting on the shores of Chakachamna Lake.

To cut a long story short, Chris had a lot of explaining to do.

***

Chris yawned lazily as he awoke.

A burst of wonderful scents blossomed into his mind as he closed his mouth. Everything was so intense and recognisable, from the smell of nearby vegetation to a whiff of the delicious, edible deer that had drunk at the lakeside hours ago.

Mmhh...deer. He felt like he could gulp down at least two, maybe two and a half if he was greedy.

The waters of the lake lapped his lower half gently, caressing him with a cool touch.

He didn't want to get up but he knew it was time, the sun must almost be rising. He was just so sleepy though. Besides, lying there in what should be a freezing cold lake, fantasizing of chasing deer just seemed so comfortable and lazy.

<em>Wait, what!?</em>

Chris snapped out of his dragon induced stupor with a startled snort, his head rearing up to assess his surroundings like a submarine's periscope.

<em>What the fuck!</em> He shouted internally, half panic, half amazement.

<em>I thought we agreed?</em> His dragon answered sleepily. <em>We needed to be stronger.</em>

As he carefully inspected his new, sleek, reptilian body he couldn't help chuckling, a deep breathy rumble emanating from way down in his throat.

"I didn't imagine it would feel like this," He spoke. He knew the words came from his own mouth but they couldn't be reconciled against the rumbling sibilant voice he heard.

Before he could debate any further with his other half, he felt a warning tingle on the back of his neck. Instinctively, he knew someone or something, was approaching.

Reactively, he leapt from the water he'd been using as a bed with a snarl, presenting his side towards the trees where he felt the danger approaching. Hawk-like vision swept the undergrowth for the threat. His foreleg raked the earth and stones on the shore in warning as his lithe purple tail swished and arced.

Internally, he marvelled how the dragon controlled this body. So long as he just relaxed and let it the dragon have control, it was seamless. He felt so effortlessly powerful. The great, bone-white spines his tail's end slashed dangerous in the air. Both ends of the dragon were ready for a fight, his wide-mouthed, snake-like head held low and ready to strike. This was a natural defensive stance, presenting a large, imposing figure whilst having his two weapons ready to bare against anything foolish enough to engage him.

His musing was cut short when the growing presence abruptly popped into existence in front of him, flapping her little blue wings tiredly as her dark blue hair trailed behind.

"Alaska! Why did you have to run so far, Master!? I've been flying all night," Immianthe began to complain before she realised she was talking to a giant dragon.

"Oh!" She squeaked, halting her advance to hover for a moment before hesitantly inching forwards with clear awe on her beautiful little features. "Master, I... Oh... You've..."

"Yes," Chris laughed in a deep rumble as his posture instantly relaxed. "Yes, I have. Come here little sprite."

Immi let out a delighted squeal and fluttered forward to his outstretched paw.

Chris curved his long, serpentine neck to look down at his diminutive companion and was thankful to notice that he still had all his digits in this form. He could even manipulate them like a hand... albeit a rather large, clawed, and exquisitely scaled hand.

As she landed, Immianthe couldn't help but swoon as the great serpent swept his head down to her, a look of concern somehow visible in his gold and purple eyes. He sniffed her carefully through his silted nostrils before flicking his great forked tongue out in her direction, waving it back and forth in front of her and just barely feathering her with its tips. She giggled and batted them away playfully.

Satisfied that his sprite was okay, he swept her up with both paws and sat back, upright, using his tail as a handy support. He let out a great sigh, accompanied by a startling puff of smoke as he looked out across the lake with her.

"Master?"

"Go ahead, Immi."

"Are you okay? I mean... It couldn't have been easy to hear what Michelle said, even if she was right. You know that, Master. You must embrace this so-called Revelation and do whatever it takes to see it through or it will surely fail. All Beings must."

"I realise that, Immi. It's not as if I didn't know it before - I just don't want to put any of you in danger. You have to understand, I may be a dragon now but a few weeks ago I was just an average human. I was sure that if they forced this role upon my, I wouldn't be able to protect you and someone I love would be hurt. I was terrified of my inexperience. Still am, I guess."

"What about now, Master? Your transformation is..." the sprite trailed off. She looked up at his new body as it towered above her. If she thought he was big compared to her before, now he was positively monstrous.

"This is a good start," Chris looked down at her with a smile, which translated into the exposure of a wide row of terrifying razor-like teeth.

"A start!" Immi spluttered once she got over the frightening thought of him devouring her like a tasty crumb. "You do not understand because you have no point of reference. Your power is immense and quite frankly frightening. I followed you here through the Ether like I was being drawn to a raging bonfire. As I got closer and closer it got so intense I had to close my eyes and follow my other senses. I was stopped and nearly eaten twice along the way until I explained that I belonged to you."

"It's not a lack of raw magic I'm worried about, Immi. In truth, I feel an almost primal energy raging inside me. It's the things I cannot control which scares me the most. How can I protect my own when I've only just opened my eyes to this world, when I have some much to learn? There are so many things to worry about, from a zealot with a gun, to this Radek character, or just a pissed off Being. I've barely learned to stand up and I'm being told to sprint."

Immi considered his words, running a tiny hand softly across the scales of his own before she replied.

"All of what you've said is true. Yes, you have a lot to learn but you will be astonished what you can accomplish if you let your instinct guide you. I and others will help. Simply ignoring these threats is placing all our lives in the hands of fate. It could end up being far more dangerous than facing them head on. Besides, you are a dragon, a hoarder and greedy protector. You will not easily let anything that belongs to you come to harm."

Her words struck a chord and he hummed a noise of approval deep in his chest, making the tiny woman shiver in delight.

"I suppose that includes you?" He looked down fondly at this little creature who influenced his life so greatly already. He caressed her naked form delicately with the back of a claw.

"Yes, Master, I strive to be one of your most precious belongings," Immi whispered breathlessly as the great beast manhandled her with his terrifying talon. Yet he was so tender that she was quickly aroused.

"Hhmmm," the dragon mused teasingly. "You have some value, little one, but I would always consider replacement, perhaps a fairy?"

"No! Never! Filthy creatures!" Immi shrieked indignantly, fluttering quickly up to his head to pound upon his snout with tiny fists.

All troubles of their previous conversation were momentarily forgotten as mock battle ensued between the two unlikely opponents.

"Okay, okay, I relent! No fairies." The dragon surrendered in pretend fear as the blue streak zipped angrily around his head, coming to a breast-heaving hover at his words of capitulation. "Besides, what dragon in his right mind would want fairy when there's sprite on the menu?"

"Exactly!" She agreed, smiling from ear to ear as she fluttered back down to her perch in his hands once again. "And don't be shy about getting a refresher on just how good I taste."

"Mmm, a delightful thought but highly impractical in my current form."

"I don't know," She replied impishly. "I could always ride your tongue all the way back to Denver."

Chris had to laugh at that image.

"Creatively greedy and mood lifting as always, thank you, Immi. You never seem to disappoint."

"You're welcome, Master. I do try my best."

Chris looked to the horizon, the sky was getting rapidly brighter.

"Speaking of Denver, I suppose we should head back soon. I don't want to worry the others."

"It may be a little too late to avoid that, Chris. However, once they see your magnificent new form I am sure all will be forgotten. In fact, I am almost certain that hot, steamy, dragon-sex will ensue," Immi chirped.

"Well, that's about the best possible outcome I guess. However, I can think of several others which involve me being beaten within an inch of my life," Chris said quite sheepishly for a giant dragon. "So before we go, let's get some breakfast."

"Yummy! Yes please, I'm starving after flying all the way here!" she chirped enthusiastically.

"You're always starving," he replied humorously. "But it's somewhat endearing."

He was about to start drawing magic in the usual way he fed Immi but he felt an instinctual tug from his dragon and decided to follow it.

Placing Immi gently on the ground beside him, he raised his reptilian arms in front of him and felt a tingling sensation in his fingertips. Little tendrils of purple energy sprouted forth, traveling a short distance before coalescing into a pulsing, black orb about the size of a soccer ball.

This was all well and good Chris supposed but he didn't understand what it meant. He was acting under the dragon's prompt

He glanced down at the Sprite briefly who was watching in open mouthed shock at the frivolous display of magic. Following the feeling further, he aligned his head with the orb, opened his wide jaw partially and watched in amazement as what could only be described as two beams shot instantly forward into the dark orb.

They were bright purple, almost pink. An intense heat was building in his mouth where they originated, one on each side of his tongue from tubes he was suddenly aware of for the first time. They lead back to some sort of special glands towards the back of his jaw which he could feel pulsing. This certainly wasn't how dragons breathed fire in the books Chris had read growing up!

Thankfully, the beams extinguished after a few seconds and he closed his mouth experimentally. He willed the orb closer, until it hovered just above his paws. To his astonishment it was emanating an intense cold and he got the feeling it would be a bad idea to touch the substance directly.

However, he found himself releasing his hold on whatever spell had created the dark orb and it faded away. A smaller core of greyish-purple was revealed in the dawn light. Solid and highly volatile, faintly pulsing energy.

Immianthe was spluttering as he turned and placed it gently in front of her. The sphere would easily have reached half way up her foot-long body, had she stood next to it. It also clearly outweighed her several times over.

The sprite understood what it felt like to be a dung beetle, for she wanted to roll this far oversized meal away and hide it until she was ready to birth a healthy clutch of spritelings and have it ready for them to devour. Putting these thoughts aside, she turned back to the dragon and looked at him skeptically.

"To think you are concerned about protecting your brood when you show off with magic like that! I'm thankful, Master, but this is far more than even I can eat and you just used defensive magic of the highest tier to convert plasma into solid energy!"

Chris took a moment to decipher her almost scolding tone. Huh, plasma beams.

"Well, does it make it any less impressive if I tell you that I didn't know what I was doing?" he asked in his deep dragon voice.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
"No!" she shrieked. "Because think about what you could do if you DID know what you were doing!"

"I see your point," Chris nodded his big snake-like head. "Okay, well, enjoy. I'm going to catch a fish."

With that, the dragon got down on all fours and slunk gracefully into the lake, leaving the sprite to dig in greedily on the shore. A few bubbles marked his passage beneath the calm water until he swam out further and deeper in search of prey.

By the time he returned with the tails of two juicy fish hanging out the side of his jaw, Immi was absolutely stuffed. She couldn't take one more bite of the delicious orb in front of her. She'd tried and discovered that she did in fact have a gag reflex, something she assumed was impossible for her species. Now it hurt her to even breathe as she slumped forward, resting against her meal in defeat.

The worst part was that she'd hardly made a dent. It was so rich and heady, filling her right up to the point of bursting and then stretching her so deliciously further. Her normally svelte tummy bulged as if she was in late pregnancy.

She was defeated, and she was one very, very spoiled sprite. Still, it wasn't as debaucherously satisfying as the time he'd almost drowned her in his spunk.

"What's the matter?" The dragon leaned down after gulping his slippery aquatic meal whole. "Too much for my little piglet?"

"Oink," She panted. "You did this on purpose."

"Maybe," the dragon smiled. "I just thought you deserved a reward for coming all this way to find me."

"Ugh. Well, this is too big, just like you are," She gestured at him half-heartedly.

"Too big huh, that's a matter of perspective, little sprite," The dragon looked down indulgently.

"Semantics," Immi quipped, patting her rounded stomach almost tenderly.

"Okay, we need to go, Immi. It's getting pretty light now."

The sprite started to rise with apparent effort, only to topple over comically and sprawl on the small rounded stones of the shore.

"Can't... Move," She rolled over to see the great dragon chuckling down at her.

"Come on, Immi," He laughed with a deep rumble. "Just lie on the back of my neck and hold onto the big scales."

He knelt and placed his thick neck as close to her as possible. She managed to get up on shaky legs and flutter her wings but it was hopeless. In the end she had to climb a small rock and use its added height to claw her way on top of him. Chris couldn't help but laugh the whole time as she whined in overstuffed misery.

Once she was safely on board he raised his neck and turned out across the lake. He tried thinking of a safe place that was large enough for them to arrive back in Denver. Unfortunately, only one came to mind, as well as the painful memories associated with the last time he'd phased there.

"We can't leave it behind!" Immi suddenly wailed, scuffling as if she was about to flop off him and crawl her way back to the chewed-on ball of energy.

"I'll make you another," Chris said as he flicked the ball into lake with a taloned forelimb. It skipped across the water's surface unnaturally as he focused his mind on a useful purpose for the magic it contained. In the end, he willed its energy to clean and freshen the waters as well as imbue all the organisms calling the beautiful valley home with vitality.

It floated away as Immi reached out desperately.

"I'm sorry," she murmured as if leaving behind a cherished friend.

"Wilson!" Chris finished with a smirk before they vanished, a crackle resounding up the valley.

***

Lillian opened the huge court room doors and Annabel looked up nervously before getting the attention of the rest of the ladies.

"Thank god we didn't have to wait until court started at eight," Susan said, relieved to begin the process of contacting Chris by magical means as soon as possible.

"She's going to be angry though," Annabel whispered, mostly to herself.

"Nonsense," Petra strode forward confidently, her tall, beautifully full figure echoing the strength of her tone. "She is charged with his protection and is no doubt just as eager to find out if he's okay as we are."

"That doesn't mean she won't be pissed, Mom," Claire pointed out with a smile towards Annabel.

The dragon's brood fell in, following the mature dragoness into the massive chamber.

It was much darker inside than during regular hours. That made the opulent stone columns and the atmosphere of subjugation presented by the throne even more intimidating. The great glowing globes above were dimmed, allowing shadows to prosper. As Claire entered the grand room for the first time, she clutched her tummy protectively. She'd heard stories about Reyla Narlakis.

"It would be safe to assume she's pissed," Lillian smirked at them as they passed the portal and shut the thick doors behind them with a low creak. The vampire was always cheerful when the elf was upset.

The dark elf could barely be seen, pacing back and forth on the rich carpet set below the throne. She was only conspicuous against the murky background because of her snowy hair. As they got closer it was revealed that she wore a short silk night robe which completely matched her midnight skin. She must have been roused from her bedchamber to attend the disappearance of her most troublesome subject.

"You foolish girls!" she rounded on them abruptly with rage in her grey eyes. "That foolish dragon!"

"Lady Narlakis," Susan began apologetically before she was completely cut off.

"Shut up!" The elf screamed, anger rolling off her in waves, infecting the air. "This is inexcusable. He cannot simply leave whenever he pleases and cavort around exposing himself to humans!"

It looked like she might start into a real tirade and everyone in the room except Lillian and Petra seemed to recoil as if waiting for a blow. Even Michelle, who thought she'd grown used to the elf's short temper hadn't seen her like this before.

They were spared her further displeasure when the atmosphere in the room changed abruptly. Those with magical senses felt an alarming tickle on the backs of their necks. Moments later, an enormous purple serpent materialised behind the now frozen elf.

No one moved, gazing in awe at the spectacular Being before them. In the case of the elf, watching the surprised faces whilst the beast moved almost silently behind her. She didn't have to see the dragon to know he was there.

Senses held wide open to detect the arrival of the dragon, were now struggling against the magical outwash of his presence.

Even to Reyla, an ancient elf, his presence was astonishing. It seemed like she was a comet straying too close to the sun, slowly ablating. She watched her dark aura bend and trail away from him, bowing to his immense radiance. Whilst concerning that the young dragon had grown so, the sensation of basking before him was all too pleasant. It was like the warmth of first light on a chilly morning, caressing the soft skin of her neck.

She was awash in magic. The dragon was a chalice overflowing, power bubbling forth and overflowing onto her, into her. An involuntary shiver ran up her spine, the anger she'd experienced moments before vanishing in his presence. Vexingly familiar, even subservient thoughts replaced her rage, stunning her into momentary impotence.

Claire dropped to her knees, moisture welling in her eyes as she beheld the truth of her mate for the first time. A king among dragons. This was truly the salvation of their race and pride welled within her to know she carried his whelp.

Annabel, unable to comprehend what the other women were experiencing was still awed by his physical form. The purple dragon could only be Chris. He moved so effortlessly towards her, possessing an alien grace. The beginnings of instinctual fear stirred in the pit of her stomach. Before her was a predator, pure and simple. A sinfully beautiful predator to be sure but a predator nonetheless. The warm, tingling sensation of Bartholomew racing across her skin in excitement steadied her emotions. A glance at her protective tattoo reassured her that she couldn't be safer than in the company of her dragon.

Susan stared in wonder, dumbfounded that this was what truly lurked inside her little boy. The sweet child she'd raised as her own all those years couldn't have contained this magnificent creature bottled away. Could he? It didn't seem possible, yet here he was, undeniably a dragon of unprecedented strength and aspect.

Michelle studied the faces of the other woman, assessing their reactions. She saw a myriad of possibilities etched there; fear, worship, love, awe. She saw hope. Hope that she had finally found her vehicle to make a difference.

The full-bodied vampire simply wet her sinfully red lips and used them as a plush resting place for her snow-white fangs. She took a dangerous step forwards before she stopped herself, clutching a nearby pew like an anchor, battling to prevent her beast from taking control and flinging herself at him.

Petra was another matter entirely and lacked the vampire's self-control. For a few seconds she stood rigid, still as a stone while her senses adjusted. It was as if she'd been walking around in the dark her whole life and someone had just switched on a light. Only it wasn't her eyes that were being assaulted, it was her sensitive nose. Power and sex literally oozed off of him. It suffocated her, infected her. This was a male truly worthy of her, there was no doubt.

<em>And where there is no doubt, there will be no hesitation!</em> Her dragon surged forward, wrestling control from her so abruptly she didn't even come close to resisting. Never in her 450 years had she felt anything like this as her dragon leapt forwards, they were usually so in sync.

Chris saw it happen as if in slow motion, the beautiful blond springing unnaturally towards him. She shimmered. High in the arc of her great leap, clothes smouldered to nothing and her form grew. She elongated, bulged, and refined until a silver dragon was sailing over the top of the startled elf's head on a collision course with him.

<em>Oh crap, what do I do?</em> Chris asked his dragon. It was all well and good to be a human in control of your dragon body, but he wisely differed to a more knowledgeable source when it came to dragon on dragon combat.

<em>I'll handle this one.</em> His dragon answered smugly, taking control.

Petra lunged, extending her whole sleek silver body in a rapid strike at the larger male's neck, trying to gain the upper hand quickly against a clearly more powerful foe. To her surprise, her teeth connected, sinking into the scales of his shoulder near the base of his neck. He bellowed angrily but stood braced against her as momentum carried her body crashing directly into his.

It felt like she'd dived headlong into a mountainside. Still, she held with her teeth and raked her claws down his flank nonetheless. Her powerful wings buffeted, claws scrabbling against his lithe, scaled body.

Her efforts were short lived as his mighty tail swung in from behind her, crushing her against him again and knocking the wind from her lungs. She knew this would be over soon but she must prove her worthiness.

She bit deeper into his flesh, tasting his thick, rich blood, as it spurted hotly across her tongue.

The startled screams of the women fleeing the savage growls and flailing reptilian limbs were drowned in the male's roar of pain.

Everyone had the sense to flee except Claire, still on her knees, awed by the majesty of the spectacle before her. Left unpractised for centuries, it was a tradition rooted far back in the old ways when dragon society was strictly hierarchical. A mating battle.

At the sight of the pungent blood trickling down to the marble floor, Lillian fled the scene with a strangled hiss. She would be lost if the scent of his fresh blood hit her. She abandoned her duty to protect Reyla and the others. Protecting herself from the madness that raged inside was all that mattered. Losing herself to that screaming darkness within would do no one any good. She didn't know where she fled, only that she couldn't stay.

Chris could feel the pain of Petra's teeth but his dragon was not overly concerned, he had her right where he wanted. With a mighty heave, he slammed his body sideways into hers. The shove knocked her back the way he'd just hit her with the blunt side of his tail moments before. She wasn't ready for the blow, expecting another strike from his tail. He felt her body slacken, her jaw loosen as momentum separated them.

Petra's grip on his shoulder was torn loose, leaving a bloody mess behind as she toppled heavily into a marble pillar, stunning her again. It was no use; he used his superior strength and size masterfully. She wanted to give in to the inevitable right now, her nethers boiled in preparation to be ravaged again and again. Her muscles ached but such a mate deserved her full effort. She must fight on.

"Somebody stop them!" Annabel gasped as the larger dragon stalked towards the smaller silver.

"I don't think they want to be stopped," Susan murmured, still slightly mesmerised by the aura of the purple dragon. She could even feel his energy trickling into her passively.

"But they'll hurt each other!" pleaded Annabel, looking around for Lillian who might have some chance of intervening. The vampire was nowhere to be seen. She looked to Reyla, Michelle, Claire. No one seemed to care, they all just watched, eyes glued to the spectacle before them.

Unable to help but reluctant to turn away, it didn't take long to spot what she'd been missing. Her Chris, her future husband in dragon form, advanced on all fours, a gargantuan dragon erection pointing directly towards his target from between his hind legs.

"No way," her eyes widened in shock.

A high pitched melodic voice spoke from above as the over-full sprite fluttered clumsily down from on high.

"I have returned with dragon in toe, you will all express your undying gratitude I'm sure," she panted.

"Thank you, Immi," Annabel held out her hand as a landing zone. "But did you have to bring him back so... dragon?"

"Well of course I did. Oh! This is about to get good! You'll see, it's just as I predicted," Immianthe squeaked, kicking her legs excitedly as the male towered over his soon-to-be newest conquest.

"You wouldn't need to be gifted with the Sight to see this one coming," Reyla muttered as she caught up to Annabel. "Dragons, honestly!"

She'd jumped aside when the action started and made a retreat towards the doors with the other women. Looking back on the commotion, his radiating presence hit her front on. It was like nothing she'd felt since her childhood when she'd witnessed a live sacrifice at winter solstice. However, it carried none of the cloying stench of death. Only pure, almost loving energy which trickled steadily into her core, feeding her incredible capacity to carry magic.

"Lillian!" the elf croaked, stumbling into a nearby pew and collapsing lazily. "Get security down here at once, get everyone who can cast a ward, start sealing this room. We can't have 'this' leaking everywhere." She gestured vaguely up towards the dragons, a lazy smile on her face.

"Lillian?" she repeated.

"She left," Michelle stepped in. "Should I call Tim?"

"Hmm? Yes, call him. We must contain this as soon as possible, it's like a beacon. Something unpleasant is bound to investigate."

Despite the seriousness of the situation, the elf couldn't portray it well. It was just too delicious to relax and be fed great dollops of soothing magic, it was effortless.

Petra lunged again, as best she could anyway. She was panting to regain her lost breath as he stalked toward her, his golden eyes boring directly into her with obvious intent. She had to distract him and get away from the wall.

Chris saw her attack coming this time and instead of avoiding it, tucked his head down, butting her directly on the stout with punishing force. He seized the moment to grasp high on her neck as she recoiled from his blow. His powerful jaw locked dangerously around her in what could easily have been a killing grip. Instead he pushed her brutally to the ground and he growled dangerously into her ear.

Petra struggled one last time, crying out a piteous whine of defeat as her huge body writhed helplessly, trapped against the marble columns. Her tail sent pews into disarray as she lashed about but it was no use. She froze as his teeth clenched perilously on the most delicate part of her long neck. His fangs pricked, sinking deep to her flesh to begin pumping her full of his venom. Her wail transformed into an animalistic cry of joy as his itch hit her bloodstream, claiming her as mate.

He didn't let go, giving her neck a few shakes between his jaws for good measure. He must make sure she didn't have any fight left. There was absolutely nothing to worry about though as the older dragoness was reliving the first delights of being mated once again.

The male wasted no further time, rolling her body slightly on its side and pinning her down. She instinctively held her tail up, exposing her hot slit as he shuffled into position on top of her.

It was like this, pinned down against a pillar, next to Lady Narlakis' throne that Petra felt his massive cockhead rub against her opening. The engorged organ pulsed in need, jetting large spurts of pre-come in excitement.

She moaned in exquisite frustration as he pumped more of his potent itch deep into her bloodstream, preparing her for breeding. Her wings twitched, her spine tingled, she was ready.

His thick, insistent member prodded enthusiastically for the right angle, not an easy feat for creatures so large. They both froze as the very tip of his flared head suddenly found the right point, nestled just so between the puffy, dripping flesh guarding her opening. He pushed, gently at first but not to be deterred when her resistance proved too great. He sought a slightly better footing behind her and thrust harder, slipping inside with the help of her copious, warm lubrication.

Chris couldn't believe what he was feeling as he thrust himself further and further into her incredible body. She was so slick and hot on his hard shaft that he had to slow, savour the feeling of initially spreading her open. Her tight insides yielded before his dragon cock, squeezing deliciously against the most sensitive parts of his head and basting him in warm, thick juices.

"Ahhhh! That's it young one, now show me how you bred my daughter!" The sultry dragoness' first words to him rang out around the grand chamber.

"If you are ssso eager I will put a child in you as well!" he heard himself growl in his deep, sibilant voice.

"Oh, fuck! Yessssss! Do it!" Petra chortled gloriously in reply, her body shivering in pleasure as he secured himself ever deeper within her. He was seriously testing her limits with that thick member of his but she fucking loved it. "Ssslow, please Sire, it's been over half a century since I mated in this form!"

His response was a savage thrust, spearing himself deeper and making her yelp as her tight insides had no choice but to part before him rather painfully.

"Ooww!" She spun her long neck to snap at his snout indignantly but he brushed her aside, holding firm deep within her, stretching her to the limit. She panted, knowing it was best to relax as she adjusted to being stuffed so full. She didn't expect gentleness after attacking him but she tried again to appeal to him. "You're fucking huge, Chris, ssstop! Give me a minute."

He chuckled down at her infuriatingly, rolling his hips and stirring her hot, juicy channel. He even had the audacity to hunch slightly higher inside her, bumping against her already dilating cervix.

"No! Fucking Jesus, what are you doing to me!" she screamed in her deep feminine growl as he wasted no time, pushing incessantly at the opening to her molten womb. Despite the pain, her body was responding eagerly. He was laying the foundation for the orgasm of a lifetime. Already her vagina clenched and spasmed in bliss, responding instinctively to his rough treatment with further lubrication.

--------------------------------------------
There was none of the hesitation he'd felt with Claire, this time his dragon amused himself in the exquisite sensation of fucking her tight inner ring of muscle with just the thick tip of his huge weapon. Piercing slightly in but never enough to spring her trap. Snaking his serpent-like head around to look at their joining, he still had what looked like a foot and a half of dragon cock before her clinging lips would encounter his thick root. His head came back to level with hers and he nuzzled affectionately at her panting, draconian countenance.

"What do you want?" he whispered to her darkly.

"I want your thick fucking load plassstered inside of me!" Petra hissed in response. "I want you to breed me over and over!"

She arched back into him, pleasure rising at the debauchery spilling from her own mouth.

"I want that whole fucking prick of yoursss up inssside me until I'm so fat with cum I can't move!"

Chris always did believe that actions spoke louder than words so he thrust forward more firmly, feeling her elastic cervix struggle to accommodate his prodigious girth. He was relentless; giving no quarter as he slowly wedged more of himself inside the tight dragoness. She squeezed him savagely, making him feel like his cock was going to be raw and sensitive for sure. However, his persistence and her slick, oily juices won the day.

Suddenly, the flared ridge of his glans slipped through and he felt her tighten instinctively behind him, trapping him in that boiling inferno of pleasure, her fertile womb.

"Fuck!" he hissed, now it was him that needed a moment to adjust to the new, wonderful sensation as she contracted her insides, undulating against him. He could feel the thick, spongy walls of her uterus rippling against his ultra-sensitive cockhead while her vagina below began a practiced, easy milking along its stretched walls.

"Oh yesss!" Petra moaned in ecstasy. "I want that cum right now, Sssire!"

Chris, eager to oblige and already beginning to feel his immense cock harden and thicken a little further in preparation, thrust forwards, feeding her the remainder of his member.

"There's fucking more?!" the mature dragoness squealed as he finally seated himself fully, that massive arrowlike head pushing rudely against the roof of her womb. "Jesusss, you're fucking ruining me!"

"Good," The larger male panted.

He jerked his hips back slightly, pulling against her massaging, oily tissues before thrusting the relatively short distance back to full depth.

"Unngh!" She grunted sexily beneath him, so he did it again.

"Mmhhh! Oh yeah, that's it," Petra continued to grunt and moan as each heavy thrust brought her nearer to that sweet oblivion lurking just around the corner. She was already so close.

Chris submitted to the pleasure gladly, it felt like his sensitive, throbbing knob was being bathed in hot, liquid butter and polished with a velvet cloth at the same time. Something enormous was growing inside of him in response to this beautiful fertile creature. He could feel a great mass of energy collecting. The more he thrust, the more intense the feeling became. He began to lose the regularity of his rhythm, panting and fucking her wildly.

His abdomen gave great shudders, almost cramping, as coiled energy grew and grew in his groin. It was almost too much; he shut his eyes tight in pleasure as his cock began twitching rhythmically, spitting runny streams of precum inside her. He kept thrusting; bucking into her hard as he held her body pinned against the floor and kept drilling with his massive tool.

"Ohhh fuuck! Sssire, I'm c...cumming," Petra moaned hoarsely as she felt his first little shots of runny seminal fluid scalding her insides. At the same time, it was soothing, beginning to satisfy the potent venom circulating in her bloodstream. Her raw, stretched tissues seemed to relax momentarily before spasming in climax, sending jolts of pleasure up her massive, writhing body.

It was as if they both just relaxed into the orgasm after such an intense, rapid build-up. Their release started quietly but kept building and building with no end in sight.

It wasn't until several thrusts later that Chris, mostly along for the ride, even realised he was really coming. The powerful twitches originating in his abdomen became full blown contractions. Thick, potent, cum started to truly spray from his shaft, jettisoning violently into the dragoness' ripe womb.

The male roared in triumphant pleasure as his whole body tensed and thrust with each voluminous ejaculation. Instinctively, he found her neck again and bit in, injecting more of his itch to help his chances.

Petra squealed and moaned as he began to fucking hose her insides. Her skilled channel milked and squeezed him automatically as she bucked and cried out in ecstasy. He was force-feeding her a huge amount of raw power and he just wouldn't stop dumping his seed into her beleaguered womb.

To Chris, it felt like his entire essence was being milked dry through the swollen tip of his cock. He grunted deeply with each burst of sticky semen, firing his wriggling sperm on their way and basking in the relief and ecstasy attained with each massive spurt. He gave her every scrap of magic he could muster.

Petra groaned in both pleasure and pain as she began to be overwhelmed. Both physically and magically, he was filling her well past capacity, stretching her limits. Thick, potent cum sloshed in her womb, sticking to the sides of her uterus but having nowhere to escape with his massive arrow-like head blocking its path. As he refused to stop seeding her, it had nowhere to go but up into her tubes, violently surrounding her egg and beginning to thrust their way inside.

The sheer flow of magic was frying her. She could feel it roiling and sizzling inside her. She closed her eyes and relaxed, letting it all just flow through her. A huge spasm of pleasure tingled all the way up her spine, almost breaking her concentration. She was a conduit, a vessel for this male to fill again and again, however he desired.

He shoved home one last time and with a victorious growl, giving her last jetting squirts of his potent seed. A final shudder of pleasure made him quiver right up to the tip of his dribbling erection as his heroic orgasm finally died down. He was left panting and drained on top of her, supremely satisfied.

The detonation of powerful new life erupted below him. It instantly passed through the astonished onlookers, a magical wave front announcing to the world the miracle of another dragon conception.

Chris felt the change as if he had a barometer attached to the tip of his cock, the pressure and heat inside her womb became almost crushing.

Petra was knocked from her blissful, fuck-drunk state to gawk up at him in disbelief.

The male looked down at her affectionately before moving to rub his serpentine jaw against her own.

"I told you I would give you a child," He murmured in her ear.

Too blissful, tired, and astonished to reply for the moment, Petra simply cooed lovingly back at him. She was spent. Her cervix was already loosening its tight hold on his over-thick weapon, unwilling to withstand any more punishment from the large male. Besides, it was mission accomplished as far as her body was concerned. Life blossomed inside her.

As he withdrew the thickest part, her unusual anatomy closed behind him, sealing her womb in preparation for their child. Any excess energy would be absorbed to feed the new life clinging tentatively to this world far up inside her tubes. Soon it would travel down and lodge in the thick, rich tissues of her uterus to grow strong. The thought made Petra shiver in delight. She was a mother again.

Retreating from her cervix, he drew out his extraction with several playful thrusts, obviously pleased with the way she felt wrapped around his member. She indulged him with an absent-minded moan, her thoughts distracted by the gravity of the situation. He was two for two at knocking up dragonesses. Perhaps her daughter's case could have been written off as exceptional circumstances. A second success was no coincidence. She'd just been mated, gloriously fucked to impregnation by the saviour of the dragon race.

Chris was on cloud nine as he dismounted her, his whole massive body vibrated with wonderful post coital twitches, throbs, and tingles. He was drained, sure, but basking in the dragon's cocky pride. With mere hours in this form, Chris was growing to love it. It didn't feel wrong or even unnatural having sex like this, it felt amazing. Already he idly wondered if Claire might be interested in a playful tumble as dragons.

His thoughts flew to Petra, his wonderful new mate. Human concern seeped into their shared state at the memory of her imploring him to be gentle. A plea the dragon had lustfully ignored. He sidled around in front of her, protective and fussy. Despite the violence that preceded their mating, he would regret any hurt he'd caused her.

He instinctively rubbed his head and neck against her, a dragon show of affection. He probed along her sides with his snout, sniffing out any signs of blood. Satisfied she was mostly unscathed, he lapped at the small wounds on her neck left by his fangs.

"I'm fine," she reassured him, returning his gesture and flicking her forked tongue lightly across his snout. "Just coming to terms with all this. Chris, you do realise what this means, don't you?"

"That we're mated?"

"Well, yes. But I was thinking more about the fact that you just successfully impregnated both Claire and I. It's very unusual. That's as many baby dragons conceived in a week as have been in the last century. How did you do it?"

"I'm not really sure I can give you an answer, Petra. When I was with you or Claire I was just doing what came naturally. I know it takes a lot of energy to overcome the resistance, so I mostly just throw everything I have into you and pray it works. My dragon seems to know what he's doing and I'm coming to trust that. With you it got very intense trying to contain all that energy. It kept building and building, I didn't think I could hold any more but the magic kept swelling. It felt amazing when I did finally release it though."

"That it did," she mused, raising her neck to look around at the destruction they'd caused. She inhaled sharply at the sight of sturdy wooden pews strewn around like matchsticks. There was even a great crack in the ornate pillar that he'd thrown her against. "I'm sorry I lost control. It was rude to attack like that, very uncivilised. I was just so surprised when I saw you in this form, instinct took over before..."

"It's okay," Chris chuckled, saving her as she babbled on. "I'll take it as a compliment. I'm just glad my dragon was there to help, we're much more in tune now, I think."

"That's good. We can help you get used to this form and your abilities when things settle down a bit."

"Ahem!" Claire announced herself before rushing forward to latch around her mother's neck with an excited squeal.

"Oh Claire," Petra embraced her gently with a clawed forelimb.

"Mom I'm so excited, I told you he was special, didn't I!?"

"Yes, dear although I certainly didn't doubt you for a second," Petra replied.

"I'll go check on the others," Chris excused himself, wanting to give the two women some space.

He turned his massive yet flexible body around and homed in on the huddle of somewhat nervous looking women. He padded forwards, body undulating as he fell into an instinctual gate without thinking that he was now coordinating four legs instead of just two. He proceeded down the carpeted isle, avoiding the pews lest he do any more damage.

It was interesting to see their reactions as he approached. Reyla seemed to sit up straight, composing herself but looking more than a little flustered. His dragon couldn't help but grin at that. For all her haughtiness, experience, and superior attitude she was affected by him just the same.

Michelle was talking into her cell phone, eyeing him with caution but not seeming too perturbed.

Susan had a supporting hand on Annabel's shoulder, a warm loving smile on her face.

Annabel's eyes were downcast and she held the little sprite gently against her chest.

He stopped several meters away and dropped his head low to the floor, staring up at her with his best attempt at puppy dog eyes. A plaintive whimper attempted to tug her heartstrings. He thought he saw the twitch of a truncated smile at the corner of her mouth but she was being obstinate.

He inched closer on his belly, flicking his tongue at her hopefully, playing it up to the max. She didn't budge and refused to acknowledge him even though his head now filled her vision. He knew she was definitely playing with him now. He'd known this lovely creature for years.

His muzzle was almost about to touch her when he let out a great snort and a billowing cloud of purple smoke.

Annabel squeaked in shock, jumping backwards half a foot as the cloud rose harmlessly around her.

"Chris!" She retaliated with a firm slap on his snout.

The dragon reared back with a booming laugh, shaking the sensation from his sensitive nose.

"You could have set me on fire," she looked up at him playfully.

"I believe there's a saying regarding the foolishness of teasing a dragon," he replied, leaning down to scent her closely. "Are you okay?"

"I'm okay, we were all really worried about you Chris," She held still indulgently, quivering nervously as his hot breath brushed across the side of her face. It was so strange, this humongous beast, her boyfriend. Yet she could hear the tender concern in his deep, growling voice. It was one thing to get used to his half-form. This was an entirely unreal experience. "I really didn't expect you to show up like this."

"Believe me, it came as a surprise to me too. I certainly didn't expect the ah... warm welcome from Petra either."

"Public sex bordering on bestiality. Tasteless as usual, Chris, but your lack of dignity gives me hope that you are still in there somewhere. Is this how you raised him, Susan, to be a boastful exhibitionist pervert?" Annabel asked.

"Well I tried my best," Susan beamed cheekily. "But you see he picked up with this awful girl at school and he's never been the same since."

"As if," Annabel retorted indignantly. "I was the one trying to stop two dragons from hurting each other. Everyone else was practically cheering them on. I suppose another conception is cause for celebration though."

"Yes, sorry about the spectacle. It must have been quite the barnyard education. I can only plead that dragons don't put much stock in human taboos," Chris couldn't help himself feeling embarrassed now that the heat of the moment had died.

"I could have watched all day," Immi said regretfully.

"I've got no doubt about that, little one," Chris rumbled. "I'm glad we can joke about it at least."

"It's fine, Chris. Petra must be very pleased," Annabel reassured him. "I'm just glad you're back, it's amazing to see you like this. I guess I'd sort of imagined what you would look like as a dragon but I never did it justice. It's incredible!"

"You don't know the half of it, Annabel, his aura is also impressive," Susan stared up at him, soaking it in. "It would be frightening if it didn't feel so good."

"It's not just about transforming into a dragon," Chris explained. "I've accepted this, embraced it. I didn't realise I was still fighting the merge between human and dragon."

He paused and turned his head towards his favourite 'secret agent.'

"You were right, Michelle. I didn't ask for this power but if I have it, it's my responsibility to make use of it. I won't be so afraid to get involved from now on."

"I'm glad to hear it, Chris. You won't be alone, I'm here to help. We all are," Michelle smiled.

Chris was moved, the strength of her devotion clearly visible in her eyes. As he looked back to Annabel, Susan, and even little Immi, the same look was mirrored.

"Thank you, Michelle. I felt like my life was spiralling out of control these last few weeks, that I couldn't possibly live up to the expectations. I also wondered what I'd done to deserve the love and attention of such wonderful women. I didn't have any answers to a multitude of questions and doubts."

"That's understandable and I'm sorry I had to push you so hard. It's easy to forget how young you are when I see the power you wield. People defer to you, listen when you talk. Just remember that you have us to rely on, it's not just you."

The silver dragoness chose that moment to sidle up beside her new mate, purring happily with her daughter in toe. Petra spoke softly to him as she rubbed up against his side, lovingly intertwining her tail with his.

"And I am sorry for piling more on top of your situation, Chris. We were so eager to find a mate for Claire; Elizabeth and I didn't consider how stressful it might be for you."

"I'm happy you're both here," Chris' throat felt thick with emotion he tried to contain. His two dragonesses and thoughts of their burgeoning family fulfilled a deeply instinctual need he hadn't comprehended until his recent transformation.

"Well I'm not sorry at all," Claire laughed. "It's worked out great for me so far."

Chris was trying to think of a witty response for the lively redhead when the great doors creaked open and Tim Garril peaked inside. The elemental did a brilliant double take at the sight of the two dragons just meters away but managed to compose himself after a few seconds. Behind him, excited voices could be heard in the waiting area.

The compound was starting to wake up, Beings hopeful for an audience with Reyla where already starting to queue. Court didn't officially start for another hour at least but waiting early could save the plaintiffs time on a busy day. Of course, it didn't help that anyone with enhanced hearing or magical senses could clearly tell there was something important going on inside already.

Tim slipped inside to receive his instructions from Reyla as he did so, the gap in the door opened further and someone caught a glimpse within.

Eager to confirm what he thought he'd seen, the young elf noble was bold enough to push the doors open. Soon, curious Beings crowded the great doorway despite Tim's best efforts to manhandle them shut.

Their looks of awe made Chris uncomfortable. Petra seemed to sense this and nudged him encouragingly. The crowd stood mesmerised by the two dragons, such rare and powerful Beings.

Seizing the opportunity, a harried looking werewoman pushed her way to the front, dragging a small boy of perhaps six or seven behind her.

"Please, great dragon, my son suffers horrible fits when he tries to change with the moon. The pack has begun to think he is cursed or worse yet, infected. We are to be banished if he cannot run with the pack on the next moon. Please heal him. I don't know how we could survive without our pack and surely none other would take us in with his condition."

At the end, the woman prostrated herself before him.

Chris was taken aback but moved by her desperate plea. Initially he thought of turning her away but instead steeled himself to his recent resolution. His power was there to be used, hopefully constructively. He took the few careful steps forward and snaked his head down to the level of the crowd, looking at the woman.

"Get up," he spoke to the woman. "Do you know I've only recently come into myself as a Being, that I have no training in magic or healing? Would you still ask for my help and accept responsibility for the outcome, whatever that may be?"

"I had heard rumour of you," the woman looked up at him hopefully. "Although I didn't know the full extent of your situation. I just thought someone of your power... Yes. I will accept any help you can give, I have no other hope for my boy."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
Everyone looked on in interest as the dragon brought his inquisitive gaze to bear or the child in question, who quivered a little fearfully as he was looked over by the great serpent.

Reyla was especially interested to see how things unfolded. Throwing the woman and the others out had been her first instinct. She'd been on the verge but her attuned senses picked up on the root of the issue. A malignant enchantment lodged deep within the boy, advanced dark magic. A curse was indeed involved. She couldn't imagine what a mere child could possibly have done to warrant such a punishment.

It was certainly within her powers to help the child but the toll on her resources would not be insubstantial. She would normally demand a steep price for such a favour. By the looks of it, the woman couldn't possibly hope to pay what it would cost here in Reyla's Court or elsewhere for that matter.

"What's your name? I'm Chris," The dragon asked the boy. While he waited for the boy to gather his courage and respond, Chris searched his small form for traces of magic.

"T...Thomas," the boy responded with reluctance after his mother prodded him gently.

"Well, Thomas, let's see if we can find the problem. I should be an expert at this. You see, I had an enchantment holding my dragon locked inside me until just a few weeks ago. But hey, look at me now."

"You... you got fixed?" Thomas asked.

"He certainly did not," Claire whispered with a smirk, poked her mother's silver flank to emphasise her innuendo.

"I did actually," Chris ignored the dragonesses mirth as he continued his inexperienced examination. "I'm hoping I can help so you can transform too.

He could sense a dark area in the centre of the boy's chest, but it was vague. His dragon took over, cocking his great head to one side, bringing one gold-mottled eye to bear up close.

What he sensed disgusted him, who would do such a thing? A twisted morass of malicious energy was entwined within his core. To his senses it seemed to spread like dark tree root, snarling and entwining tissues and organs. No doubt it siphoned away any power the boy could muster as he tried to shift, causing the fits as it fed and grew.

"Hold him," Chris told the boy's mother before looking the boy in the eye. "Thomas, I'm going to try to fix you but I think it's going to hurt, a lot. I want you to try to be brave and we'll have you changing like everyone else in no time."

The boy nodded, accepting the challenge with the hope of being able run with the rest of his pack as his instincts told him to.

Annabel came forward as well and placed a comforting hand on the boy's shoulder while his mother held his hands. The other onlookers watched closely but maintained their distance, perhaps cautious of the untrained dragon practicing magic.

Chris gave Annabel a thankful nod before focusing back on the problem at hand. He didn't have training in healing, nor any knowledge of spellcraft to be able to counteract the evil inside the boy. If he'd learned anything about his abilities so far it was that he could depend on brute force. He was also good at burning things.

Although tired, he gathered what reserves he could manage. It came slowly, tingling along his scales, across his body, and towards his solar plexus. That central hub of his magic began to warm and splutter, eager to be expended. It dawned on him how much he'd grown in the transformation. Even as he felt exhausted from his efforts with Petra, it came to him. A fine trickle of energy, leaking into his being from some unknown wellspring.

Focusing back to the task at hand, he outlined his intentions against the dark tendrils. A stray thought or distraction could spell disaster but the dragon lent him steel nerves. Finally ready, he sent a tentative stream of magic to do its work like a fine blowtorch. He started at the edge of a hyphae-like tendril and watched anxiously. It smouldered first then flared and crisped to nothing.

The boy seemed unharmed. Chris' design relied on his connection to the Ether, that shadowy realm where magic seemed to have a presence partially detached from the physical. That way he could destroy the spell but not the boy. Encouraged, he unleashed a larger flow of magic, burning back the spell like a twisted bed of ivy.

Thomas cried out, shaking as sweat instantly formed on his small brow and his body flushed hot. Chris almost lost his concentration but refocused his efforts and slowed the magic. His mother and Annabel whispered comforts and braveries but the uncomfortable heat inside his chest dominated his senses and their words fell on deaf ears.

Somehow, heat was being translated into the boy's body. He didn't know how, perhaps his own workings weren't precise enough or the malicious spell had a defence mechanism. He was hurting the boy though it didn't seem anything too life threatening. He was loathed to stop before all of the malicious branches had been charred to nothing. Thankfully, his method seemed to be effective and it was less than a minute before the last of the spell, a gnarled bowl of woody blackness, was being thoroughly incinerated. Finally, he stemmed his efforts and let his hold on the magic slip away.

"It's gone," Reyla assured him as he began checking the boy over again to be sure.

"What was it?" Chris asked, annoyed that the elf hadn't offered to help if she had followed his progress so closely.

"I suspect something passed on from his father. It appears to have grown with the boy since birth but there's no sign in the mother," she explained with an inquisitive cock of her head. "Not the method I would have chosen to remove it. Unrefined, wasteful, and painful for the boy but to each their own."

Chris rolled his great golden eyes in frustration, turning back to Thomas who was thankfully recovering quickly now that the magical flames had done their job.

"Thank you, dragon," his mother clutched her son to her chest. "If there's anything I can ever do to repay you I will. I won't forget what you've done for us."

"It's okay, I am happy to have helped," Chris didn't want to make a big deal about helping the boy but it seemed like his mother was not going to let him get off so easily when she opened her mouth to protest his humbleness.

"Leave the dragon be," Reyla cut her off, quickly back to her authoritative self. She recognised the need to manage the gathered Beings before they overwhelmed the dragon with requests now that they had seen his work. "You should take the boy home to recover. As for the rest of you, leave us, I don't know why I haven't thrown you all out myself. Barging in on a private meeting, I should have you all in shackles!"

The crowd quickly retreated, casting furtive glances over their shoulders but intelligent enough to take Reyla's threat seriously.

Once the doors were again closed and the group was left in relative peace, Annabel reached up to touch the dragon's snout affectionately.

"I'm so proud of you, Chris," she murmured.

"Yes, that was very sweet," Susan agreed. She couldn't help the warm feeling of maternal pride inside of her. It was obvious that the woman and child had been in desperate need of help. Chris had offered it freely as too few Beings would have in this day and age.

"Yes, yes, that was all very moving," Reyla's tone left no doubt that she understood the definition of the word sarcasm. "In time you'll come to learn not to give handouts. Hand-outs lead to entitlement and soon you'll be swamped with requests for this and that. One day you'll find yourself weary, sucked dry, and unable or unwilling to continue. You'll have nothing to show for your efforts other than their 'undying gratitude.' On that day, they will forget everything you have done for them, for their ancestors, and turn against you for their immediate gain. Such is the way of the young races. The humans even have an appropriate children's fable. Be careful, dragon, lest you be mistaken for a golden goose."

Petra snorted, her chest heaving as beautiful musical laughter sprung from her throat. She arched her wings and laid one possessively across her mate's back before snaking her neck down to confront the lecturing elf. All eyes turned to the majestic silver serpent as she trailed off with a chuckle, then a throaty purr of contentment.

"Are you blind, elf? Does he not, at this very moment, wash over you like the first warm spring breeze after winter? Here I stand, new life growing in my womb, proof that he is no ordinary dragon. Can you not read the signs? Something is changing in this world. You should be thankful he is a generous soul, perhaps one day he will show that generosity even to you."

"I am not blind to these unusual circumstances. Nor do I take them lightly," Reyla countered. "However, your race stands on the brink of extinction at the hands of greedy fools. Chris would do well to remember that."

"Sound advice, Lady Reyla, but how will this world be healed unless those with power are generous and seek goals other than their own gains?"

Reyla cocked her head speculatively as they all waited to hear her response. Dragons, honestly. If there was a race more caught up in idealism she had yet to encounter them. However, she could not deny the logic. The world suffered at the hands of both Beings and humans. Generosity and sacrifice by all would be necessary to heal the damage, to come together peacefully. Did it not stand to reason that the generosity of those with the most to give would be most important?

"I cannot fault your spirit, Petra. The world would be a much better place if everyone thought as you do. Philosophy aside, we should coax Christopher back into his human form immediately. There's no telling who or what will catch wind of his 'spring breeze' as you so eloquently put it. Hopefully that will mute his aura to more reasonable levels. Then you can be as generous as you please, so long as you consider his safety at every step."

"A fair point," Petra seceded. "Chris, would you mind?"

"Damn, I was just beginning to enjoy myself," Chris chuckled.

"Sire, if you were just beginning, I pity myself for mating with you," the mature dragoness purred contentedly.

Susan and Annabel shared a smile, knowing how Chris became embarrassed when the innuendo started to fly. It was wiped from their faces when his dragon outline started to shimmer. As he and the dragon worked together to change back, skipping their half form completely and aiming for their human guise, he imploded.

He was amazed how easily the transition occurred. Compared to that fateful day when he'd first awakened, it was almost seamless. Now that he and the dragon were in tune, it was a painless process, a team effort rather than a struggle for dominance.

A startled gasp made Chris open his eyes to looks of bewilderment and shock around the room. Even Tim Garril was eying him from the doors with startled appraisal, one eyebrow raised in an almost comical expression.

"What?" Chris looked around, smiling. "Did I grow two heads or something?"

There was a pause before anyone answered and typical of the naughty sprite, she went straight to the heart of the matter.

"No, Master," She pouted. "But you certainly did grow."

"Grow?"

"I would call this a massive setback to my plans," Immi paused, her frown turned comically into a mischievous grin as a lewd thought crossed her ever lascivious mind. "But at least I get to see how the rest of you handle it!"

Chris followed her gaze down his body and quickly realised he was naked.

"Shit, should have thought of that," he murmured, reaching forward to cover himself automatically with both hands. It was then that he first realised something was different.

Annabel couldn't believe what she was seeing as her fiancé attempted to modestly conceal himself. The exact details remained a mystery but having been intimate with him over the last year, she knew he'd somehow experienced a growth spurt. With the shocking parts mostly concealed by his hands, she looked over the rest of his naked body, realising just how profound the change was.

Her heart went out to him, knowing that he would struggle with this final aspect of his union with the dragon. She stepped in front of him, wrapping her arms around his middle. The hug, apart from comforting also allowed him some modesty by blocking his privates from the room.

She looked up at him, towering above her like never before, her head barely reaching his neck, her arms very nearly failing to encircle his massive barrel-chest.

"What the fuck?" He mouthed down at her, disbelief written all over his features.

"Don't look at me," Annabel replied, trying to make light of the situation as she turned to address the others. "A blanket? Some clothes please? Anyone?"

Everyone sprang into action, looking almost guilty for gawking. No one would have blamed them.

There was nothing that could easily be used to cover him nearby short of ripping up the lush carpet so Reyla thought quickly and summoned a rich, furry blanket from her own bedchambers. She handed it to Annabel with eyes averted. Any thoughts she might have entertained previously about coupling with the boy were now tempered with apprehension.

Susan quickly shook the folded blanket out and hurriedly helped Annabel wrap him up under his armpits. Her hand rested on his chest as she shared a meaningful look with her son's fiancé. She rose on her toes and spoke softly into his ear, trying to convey the heartfelt love she felt for this man.

"We'll get through this, Chris."

Reyla watched the doors close behind them, still shocked at the profound change the young man had experienced. She'd never heard of a dragon undergoing anything like it.

Only as the doors closed and the group proceeded on their way back to the hotel did she suddenly realise his magical presence was completely undiminished, only ebbing slowly with distance. This presented an issue.

Detection was a foregone conclusion, that ship had sailed. Now she must prepare a response for whoever came to investigate.

"Timothy," she spoke suddenly. "Quietly activate your best people. We need to have a good team dedicated to this around the clock. Maintain your distance, we don't want anyone else getting dragon-struck if it's avoidable. The witch, Susan, may be able to give you an antidote if it's an issue."

"Yes, my lady."

"What did you make of him?" she asked as he turned to carry out his orders.

He paused, seriously considering what he'd seen and felt.

"Honestly?" he glanced sidelong at the elf to assess her legendary mood.

"Yes," Reyla sighed.

"It's a good thing he doesn't know what he's doing. If that boy had the experience to wield magic as you do, I'd be working for him."

***

Annabel hustled him through the door, through the living room, their bedroom, and straight into the bathroom.

On the walk back, she'd soon spotted a jagged red zigzag on the back of his shoulder. A little dried blood formed a small trail a few inches down his well-formed muscles, showing how quickly he'd healed from Petra's 'love bites.'

He assured her it was fine. She still marched him into the shower under the pretext of getting him clean, determined to be alone with him, reassure him.

It was a large shower but it felt smaller to Chris as he dumped the blanket and entered the warm spray. Annabel wasn't far behind him, stripping efficiently and following him quickly inside.

She squirmed in close to access the broad stream of water, letting it flow over her scalp, into her hair and across her face. Breathing deep, she enjoyed the pattering warmth for a moment. When she moved a little to the side and opened her eyes he was watching her with the faint traces of that cautious look she'd grown to know. She grinned up at him.

"Let me guess," he chuckled. "Bridges?"

"That's right, Babe," she beamed. "I'm glad you're finally getting it."

"But fuck me, look at the size of my hands!" Chris held them up in disbelief. He'd heard of 'dust bin mitts' before but his definitely qualified now.

"It's not your hands I'm worried about," Annabel smirked. If she had to describe what she was seeing, she'd say he was somehow just...bigger.

Whatever the dragon had changed inside of him, the outcome was clear, he was now built like a tank. Annabel estimated he stood at 6'6''at a bare minimum but that wasn't even close to the most notable change.

His entire body had grown, broadened, and clearly thickened. She didn't think for a second he had become grotesque, his skin was still pale and smooth, a small layer of fatty padding where it was appropriate and deliciously little where it counted. He was just really big, broad, and well built. She was reminded of what she assumed a mighty ancient warrior would look like. The conquering Viking types.

What Annabel was most worried about was the slumbering monster hanging between his legs.

She looked down between them at it. Perhaps their new height disparity exaggerated the effect a little. It was, after all, a few inches closer than she was used to but there was no doubt that his penis had grown with him.

"It's like, almost as big as you used to be hard, only soft."

"Bullshit. There's no way," Chris balked at the thought.

Annabel caught her inquisitive little companion barrelling down her forearm towards the huge member and quickly scolded the little dragon.

"Time out, Bartholomew, give us little space here. This is serious."

He looked up at her balefully, before complying with his mistress' wishes. The tiny tattoo retreated slowly to his resting place around her belly button and became still, sulking. Annabel returned her attention to the problem at hand.

"It's not like you were small beforehand, Chris. Fuck, look at that thing. You didn't do this on purpose, did you?" She knew a lot of guys had fantasies about having larger penises but that just seemed silly, especially when Chris had already been more than big enough.

"Of course not, Dee," he looked down at her, clearly worried.

She bit her lip speculatively as she considered what she was going to do about this situation. She could already feel herself becoming automatically aroused, being in the shower with him, touching him. Those thoughts made up her mind for her and she decided that there was no use worrying about how she was going to handle this until she tried. Besides, reassuring him would do a world of good.

She slid her hand down across his toned abdomen, coming to rest against his thick root before slipping underneath to cradle the massive shaft. Her other hand joined its sister and she held it up, warm water pooling around it. It flopped heavily, the head dangling flaccid over her palm.

"You don't have to," Chris started.

"Shhh," she looked up. "I want to see what we're dealing with."

"Okay, I guess," he murmured.

She smiled and ran a hand down the shaft to tease his testicles, stopping abruptly when she encountered her target.

"Holy shit, Chris, they grew just as much. I can barely get one in my hand!" Annabel couldn't decide if she was excited or terrified, perhaps both. But as the words left her mouth, she felt the shaft twitch under her touch. He seemed to like what she was doing.

She smiled and gave it an experimental tug. It throbbed back, the first pulses of blood becoming trapped inside. She kept it up, bringing the other hand back to the base to provide firmer stimulation.

She looked up at him mischievously and it was like a flip had been switched. The girth expanded like an air tube hooked up to a powerful compressor, surging in her hands and forcing her grip further apart. It quickly poked her in the tummy, she giggled and shifted backwards to give him space.

Perhaps most sinister was the massive, blunt head that reared at the tip. She could tell it was going to be just as thick if not thicker than his root. Like an angry red apple, it continued to throb and grow.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
She kept up her gentle ministrations, running her hands around it as the warm water caressed it on all sides. Soon enough it rose under its own steam and she followed it up to about forty-five degrees from his body where it bobbed proudly.

Her body couldn't help but react to the beautiful if terrifying specimen of masculinity. Perhaps it was his magic acting on her again but her greedy snatch began the incessant moistening she'd grown to love. She almost felt like scolding herself but what was the point? This was just the same as what they usually did in the shower, only now he was inhumanly large.

Chris watched in disbelief as his penis, which he'd grown to enjoy just fine thank you very much, transformed into a veritable weapon. Annabel's hands looked absolutely tiny stroking it and wherever she gripped, she didn't come close to encircling its girth. The thing looked brutal, and the cockhead perched at the end of the thick shaft was positively obscene. His foreskin rested snugly behind an exaggerated, dark pink ridge. It was sensitive as all hell too, the exposed, throbbing tissue tingling maddeningly as warm heavy droplets fell on it from above.

His recent union with his dragon was now affecting his human body, drastically. That much was clear.

"What the fuck am I supposed to do with that?" Chris asked incredulously.

"Well, there are going to be some challenges," Annabel began using both hands more forcefully now that he was completely hard, jacking up and down both sides of his cock.

Chris sighed, what she was doing felt really good but he was more worried that this change would prevent them from having sex.

"Look how long it is, Annabel, you're not going to... Fuck, even Petra and Claire are going to struggle," he complained even as she jerked him harder.

"I'm afraid the length is the least of our concerns Chris. It's way thicker than it used to be. Maybe if we get some proper lube we could try but even then, I'm not sure. You could easily tear me if we weren't careful. One thing's for sure though, I'm glad you weren't like this our first time, I'd have had no chance whatsoever."

"What are we going to do, Dee? I can't believe my change would actually stop me from making love to you. It's not right."

"Me either, Chris," Annabel assured him. "Maybe I can still suck it?"

Before he could object, she quickly dropped to her knees in the large stall, closing her eyes against the droplets pelting her from above. Chris reached up and adjusted the showerhead, directing the flow away from her face.

She felt her way into place, soft lips colliding with his shaft just below the head. She kissed him there, puckering her mouth and flicking her tongue out across the edge of his sensitive ridge. He hissed appreciatively and ran a large hand into her clinging brown tresses. The monster twitched its approval too.

He still felt just as she remembered, steel wrapped in satin. Still tasted and smelt just as intoxicating. His pheromones were thick around his equipment and Annabel was getting a heady dose in the warm, enclosed shower.

She kissed down one side of the fearsome erection, crossing underneath and getting her first glimpse of the fat tube running up the length, it looked so wide and rigid. He groaned again as she kissed her way back up the other side, coming to a halt and looking up wickedly at him as she reached the engorged crown.

"Now comes the real test," She purred, unable and unwilling to fight her arousal. She could feel herself flutter inside at the prospect of tackling this monster, her body preparing the copious lubrication it knew it was about to need.

"Fuuckk! Dee, that feels amazing," Chris watched as she slowly placed a soft, warm kiss against his very tip. Wrapping her sweet lips up and down several times, she began drawing him in her hot embrace.

Annabel was just getting warmed up and soon she was being bolder, trying to get more and more of the fearsome knob into her mouth, sucking, spitting, and eventually licking her way further down onto him.

He thought she might tease him forever but eventually Annabel buckled down to the task at hand and he watched her lips thin, expanding around the thickest part before sealing behind his ridge. She'd actually taken him inside, more than he'd hoped for.

Now the challenge was to provide pleasure, which was proving problematic given how little room there was to spare for movement. She pushed downwards but instantly felt him butt up against the back of her mouth, triggering her gag reflex and forcing her to back off respectfully. Her eyes scrunched in concentration as she got a hold of herself, extra thick saliva was being secreted in response which she used to bathe the angry beast in consolation. She let it slip the seal of her lips and run down to slicken her hands as they struggled with their own challenge.

His bulbous knob was much thicker than she was used to. Before all this, she'd been making progress on getting him down her throat because she knew he loved it. To be honest, she also loved that look on his face when she was swallowing him down. She was going to have to start all over again with this larger version. This time, her work was really cut out for her.

Resigned to only service his crown for the time being, she explored the possibilities. Her tongue could flick around his sensitive underside well enough and his groans left no doubt he appreciated her attention. She sucked hard, caving in her cheeks and teasing her straining lips back and forth on his sensitive ridge.

"Shit, that's good!" He rewarded her with a cry of pleasure and a runny spurt of tasty precum across her tongue. His essence was deliciously spicy and stimulating, setting her body tingling and her insides a quiver. She couldn't help but grin lewdly around him as he continued to dribble his excitement in response to her tender ministrations.

Unfortunately, she couldn't continue forever. It was like the dynamic in her mouth had changed entirely. No longer was her tongue the dominant player in their blowjob, that role belonged to the mammoth dragon-enhanced cock she yearned to please. Her tongue was being overwhelmed and her jaw was becoming sore. It was a constant struggle to keep her teeth out of the way and it became clear that fellating him for any length of time wasn't going to happen without practice.

She reluctantly pulled back, taking deep breaths through her nose and teasing him with tender parting licks. At least she knew it was possible.

"I can't keep that up very long, sorry," She admitted. "But I have another idea."

"Don't apologise, that was awesome. Do whatever you want, Dee, just don't hurt yourself," Chris panted, a shiver of pleasure running up his spine as she continued to jerk his shaft.

Annabel rose slowly, turned, and presented her spectacular rear end. She placed her feet close together, arching her back. Her shoulders, chest, and face pressed up against the cool wall.

Chris marvelled. Water droplets glistened in the light, trickling down her soft skin, marred only by those tattoo digits along her left shoulder blade. The dewdrops rolled beautifully to her slender waist and flared hip before running off down her toned legs. She flicked her wet, dark mane over her opposite shoulder and looked back at him provocatively.

"Come on, Babe, slide it up against my pussy."

Chris looked down as a hand emerged between her legs to guide him, he pushed the truncheon-like erection down into her tender grasp and it was quickly drawn up against her weeping little slit.

She held it there, savouring the heat given off by the massive head, running her puffy vulva back and forth across it a couple times to tease him. It felt like the head was thicker than her entire mound but it was wonderful to slide her sensitive lips across the top, splitting them apart and squishing down onto him.

Chris groaned at the sensation, jettisoning more slippery precum against her tender opening, wanting nothing more than to push forcefully inside his broodmate. He kept his cool, enjoying the stimulation as much as possible but letting her control everything.

Annabel adjusted her stance a little, one hand gripping the underside of his head, the other cradling the shaft just below. Her smooth thighs and springy ass cheeks completed the sensation. As she bucked backwards, sliding him against her smooth, warm, flesh, he finally understood what she was going for.

"You always said you liked that gap between my legs, now you're actually going to fuck it," Annabel gasped.

He took up the gauntlet and began flexing his cock back and forth.

She was getting quite a lot of stimulation herself as it rubbed against her juicy sex. Her clit especially was getting even more attention than it was used to, the huge penis rubbing directly against it again and again.

"It feels great, Dee," he groaned back, flexing forwards a little harder to see how she responded. Soon enough he took up a steady, measured rhythm, fucking in and out of the warm little pocket she engineered just for him. He had to love her even more for trying.

"Don't worry Chris...mmmmhhnn... we'll get there. Trust me!"

Chris looked down across her superb rump. It jiggled enticingly with the motion of their bodies. Below, the length of the turgid shaft was left mostly unattended but from this angle it did almost look like he was fucking her.

Despite how nice this felt, he had to admit that it paled in comparison to the sight and feeling of her pussy spread tightly around him, welcoming him into its warm embrace and pulling him deep inside.

What had him so worked up was her. She astounded him again, embracing every problem he brought to their relationship. He loved her so, rocking her wet body against him and making little noises like this was the best thing ever with each of her eager, small hip-bucks.

"I'm struggling here, Dee," he warned, his thoughts and the sensations at his tip proving to be more than adequate to bring him off in his aroused state.

"Good," she encouraged over her shoulder. "When you go, I want you to... Fuck! I want you to push it up against my hole, okay? Unngghh! I want you to squirt it up inside me!"

"Fuck, that's hot Annabel! You're gonna make me cum," He moaned, her nasty words exciting him beyond belief. His already dangerously large cock was hardening and expanding. They both knew exactly what that meant.

Sensation raced down his shaft and into his nervous system, the pleasure of hot friction against her smooth, wet flesh. He could feel his testicles tensing, churning, as a massive orgasm reared up in his abdomen.

"That's it," Annabel cooed as she pushed her hips back, her hands massaging his organ while her vagina soaked him in hot, slippery fluids from above. She could feel his own fluid leaking from his tip too. "You still get to shoot all of that massive load in this little pussy even if you can't put it in there yet."

"Nnnghaa! Fuck!" Chris cried with his eyes squeezed shut, finally feeling the first pulse of climax race up his shaft. He pulled his head back slightly and with the help of her dexterous hands, slipped the tip up against her weeping slit. The crown parted her gooey petals, nuzzling into her juicy heat. It felt incredible as the first massive jet of his viscous semen spat violently from his tip, directly into her pink, dripping, furrow.

Just as she knew it would, Annabel's orgasm caught up with her instantly with that first shot of virile dragon-spunk. A wide grin passed her lips as her entire body tensed in anticipation. Whatever magic she was gripped by tore through her body, pleasure spread across her frame and blossomed deep in her core as the massive cock coughed up more semen.

"Gods, Chris! You're not even fucking me!" she screamed as she came undone, more and more thick cream being pumped into her welcoming vagina.

Chris couldn't help but push enthusiastically at her stretched entrance, trying to worm the massive head just a little further inside her tender folds.

Annabel surprised them both when she began pushing back too, forcing her pleasure wracked quim to stretch obscenely around the spurting weapon.

"She's trying, Chris, my little pussy is trying her best for you!" Annabel wailed, a mix of pleasure and pain addling her mind. Her hands still gripped his shaft, firmly aligning their mismatched sexes.

Just as it began to feel decidedly unbearable, a final buck of her hips forced his enormous crown passed her opening. It shouldn't have worked but they were just so slick with their combined fluids that he popped inside.

"Jesus! Annabel!" Chris grabbed her hip firmly to stop her movement. His spongy knob felt incredible, crushed just inside her little love box and still firing away to his heart's content. He didn't know if he'd ever cum this much before as it began to run out of space inside her quivering channel, squelching back out her entrance and onto the tiled floor below.

"It's so god-damn much! I can feel it," Annabel moaned, experiencing his hot, magic-rich spunk fill her beyond capacity. It was wonderful, forcing her orgasm into a slow, gentle boil. It was rolling over her in blissful waves, her whole body shaking and twitching in magic induced ecstasy.

However, she couldn't ignore the head of the massive shaft wedged inside her, pushing her to the absolute limit. It was going to take some serious work before she could fuck him properly again, too.

"Are you okay?" Chris panted heavily as his cock finally gave up the last of its load, dribbling into her drenched hands and washing down the drain in great gelatinous globs, so wasteful of the magic it contained.

"Yeah, I'm fine," she looked back over her shoulder with an obvious flush across her pale skin. She was out of breath too. "Just hold still for a little bit, it hurts but it's definitely in there. We are going to have to take it slow but this is a good sign."

"You're fucking crazy," Chris looked down at her, he could see the rest of his long, fat shaft emerging from between her supple butt cheeks and couldn't help but question her optimism.

It was almost torturous being inside her as his sensitive, post-orgasmic glans was being fiercely squeezed by her flooded entrance. It would tense down on him weakly every now and then, squeezing him as echoes of her orgasm bounced back and forth with her. That she came at all he would be ever grateful for.

Annabel held still and tentatively felt between her legs at their joining, almost wishing she had her phone so she could assess the situation down there properly with a picture. It was a slippery mess, their fluids coated everything and made a matt of her finely trimmed pubes. As it was, her labia and the entrance of her vagina felt like they were being split apart. Thankfully it wasn't as bad as in the beginning. Maybe all that cum of his was making her relax. Perhaps it was blind hope, but she thought it didn't feel impossible now that she'd straddled the biggest hurdle, so to speak.

With a sigh, she pulled up and off him. Gasping again as pain shot through her abused sex.

Chris moaned as well, feeling her slip off his end was almost a relief, but he knew he'd be wishing himself back inside her soon enough.

Annabel cupped her vulva gingerly as his thick, sperm laden semen began flowing back out of her reluctantly. She winced, there was definitely soreness as her body tried to readjust back to her natural shape.

"Whew," she said jokingly. "See? That wasn't so bad."

Chris just shook his head as they briefly cleaned themselves up. He'd seen the pained look on her face.

When they turned the shower off he guided her from the stall and out onto the fluffy white bathmat. It was obvious she'd gone too far. In the moment he was too distracted to stop her but now he felt wretched. It was clear he'd hurt her.

He dried her off gently with the plush hotel towels. Annabel complied contentedly, perfectly willing to submit to a post orgasm pampering and a little bit of manhandling.

Chris noticed she still cupped her sex, he thought it was probably a good thing. Maybe his cum would help sooth or even heal whatever pain she felt. He fervently wished it did.

He caught several reflections of his body in the partially fogged mirror and ignored them, unwilling to confront reality for the moment.

He led her back into their bedroom and they lay down together. The bed creaking, protesting under his increased weight as he spooned in behind. Holding her close, he sighed and took a deep breath.

"Don't even start, Chris. I did what I did because I wanted to and we're going to God-damn keep doing it until I tell you to stop. Okay?" Annabel pre-empted his hand-wringing.

Chris didn't answer. Sure, it was her choice but that didn't mean he was okay with hurting her for the sake of having sex.

"Okay?!" she raised her voice a little and looked up at him indignantly.

"Okay," he murmured. "Jees."

"Good," the young vixen settled back onto the pillow, grasping his great big hand and pulling it to rest on her tummy. "Now, it wasn't even that bad so quit beating yourself up. Besides, what's the point in living in a world full of magic if we can't come up with a solution for such a minor setback?"

"Minor?" he smirked, unable to help himself.

"Fuck off, Chris, or I'm going to have to assume you're enjoying this," she laughed at her poor choice of phrase. "Okay, let's grab a nap."

She settled down into the bed contentedly, enjoying the warmth and sensation of having so much of his tingling, warm spend inside her. He definitely hadn't cum that much previously, not in human form anyway. She spared a worried thought for Susan. From her illicit chats with the witch, Chris seemed to take pleasure in force-feeding her more magic than she could handle and it was a very intense experience. What would it be like for her now?

She could feel him scenting her hair behind her and let out a soft sigh, her eyelids feeling so heavy.

As she nodded away, tired after a night spent worrying about him, Chris considered what she'd said. What point indeed, was a penis so large it caused this much trouble.

He'd been blindsided by this latest change to his physique. Sure, when he'd first awoken back on the farm with Annabel, it had taken a while to adjust to his new stature and strength. No one had told him he'd turn into a fucking giant when he finally merged completely. In fact, his dragon was curious about the changes too, unusually stumped compared to the 'reason-for-everything attitude' he'd grown to expect.

Lillian's training was going to be vital for him to get used to this body and build new muscle memory. He resolved to throw himself into it wholeheartedly tomorrow.

Shit, he probably had to buy an entirely different set of clothes too.

He mused sleepily about who he could talk to about his new penis. Obviously Susan and his dragonesses would be supportive but he doubted they knew the sort of spell craft that might help. Come to think of it, he had no idea what sort of spell craft that might be. He relied entirely on his focused intentions, knew little to no real theory whatsoever.

<em>Hold on a second</em>, he thought. <em>I should be able to fix this myself</em>.

The tiredness fled his body as he started gathering energy hastily. He grasped roughly at the magic inside him but found that exertion of force was unnecessary. It came to him smoothly now, flowing from that trickling stream dwelling within him. Already it had started to refill his empty reserves, but he reached into the Ether to help expand the flow.

He quivered gently with coursing power as he began considering what he wanted. He wanted to change his human form back to the way it had been before. Especially, he wanted loving, fun, hassle-free sex with his partners.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
Those thoughts focused inwards, on himself. Concentrating single-mindedly, he tried feeding energy into them. He was met with fierce resistance. Unsure what to do, he foolishly reached for more power. It was no use. He only felt the resistance flex or perhaps bend a little but ultimately hold firm.

The energy he'd gathered vibrated angrily, nothing grounded it.

He tried again, suddenly frightened at the sensation of his magic, failing him for the first time. It felt like a swarm of angry bees had taken up residence in his chest. Worse, he had no easy outlet. This was exactly what Immi had warned him about.

Why wasn't it working? Could he not change himself? He had to do something with the energy soon! The first true embers of panic began to smoulder and glow in his mind.

An errant, fleeting thought popped into existence. Annabel. It was crazy, it was stupid but at that point, Chris was grasping for any lifeline. All that magic had to go somewhere, and quickly.

His hand slipped down her soft tummy and into her short curls, cupping her puffy mons. What did he want? Wonderful, slippery, hot, satisfying, sex. He wanted to slip deep inside her and have her love every second, not hurt her. He hoped she would be resilient and ever eager for more.

He could sense the remnant of his freshly deposited cum inside her. There was a well of power there and the unstable energy he'd called upon leapt eagerly towards it like lightning to a grounding rod. It was working! He quickly tempered his intentions, infusing the enchantment with patience and painlessness. Hurting her now with his hastily prepared spell would be inexcusable.

The magic slowed in response, but the draw increased, becoming a steady stream towards her sex rather than a mad rush. The enchantment demanded more, and he happily called upon that unknown trickle as his reserves well and truly ran dry. He spent more than ten minutes feeding the spell as much as it needed, chanting his intentions like a mantra all the while. He felt it churn lazily, anchored to her body by the thick semen still filling her vagina.

Finally, it was done. The magic broke contact on its own, leaving him light headed and bone tired. He'd never felt that truly drained in all his life, not even after a full day of stacking hay bales by hand in Jethry's barn.

First Petra, healing the were-boy, and now this? What was he thinking? He shook his head at his own eager foolishness, praying for the best. He hoped like hell this was going to work. She'd be mad enough as it was that he'd been experimenting on her in her sleep like some sort of pervert.

A further wave of unrelenting tiredness swept through him. It couldn't be denied. His head lolled back onto the soft pillow. Eyes fluttering closed, he nestled into the unruly river of her still damp hair, scenting her. Sleep quickly embraced him with its gentle ardour.

***

Chris became aware of the presence as soon as he slipped into the Ether. Something alien brushed momentarily against his consciousness, questing, seeking. It felt like the disturbing, fleeting touch of a fish against a leg in murky water.

Everything appeared how he'd come to expect it to, grey-toned and insubstantial. Still, there was no doubt he was being observed closely. A shiver of apprehension ran up his spine. He sat up cautiously, head on a swivel as he looked for the source of the disturbance.

When he looked at Annabel's slumbering form he paused. She was not the ghostly form he had thought to find. Instead, she had far more substance to her Ether presence than normal. Resting on her side, he could see that although her extremities seemed 'normal,' the area around her groin and tummy were more present in the Ether. The area was giving off a tell-tale purple hued shimmer that instantly placed the blame for the irregularity squarely on his shoulders.

Before Chris could begin to wonder if that might mean his enchantment had been successful, the presence returned in force. It seized him, he was helpless to resist. He gasped aloud, his bulky body crashing to its knees on the nearby floor.

The presence was vast. It encircled his consciousness and laid him bare like an open book. Chris looked on with enforced detachment as it read everything that he knew, everything that he was. It understood him completely in mere seconds. There was no option for resistance or struggle, only to wait as it took from him what it willed.

When it was done, the presence somehow loosened its grip on his mind and he began to feel again. He wished it hadn't. Tears welled unbidden in his eyes and a wrenching sense of violation settled deep in his gut. Throat thickening painfully, he should have felt anger. Instead he somehow knew it would be pointless. The presence was simply observing on a level he couldn't understand with a simple term like curiosity. Whatever it was, this thing could crush him like an offending insect if it chose.

That was not its choice as his body stiffened a few moments later. The sensation was reversed and it started feeding him information instead.

Chris' stomach churned as the first blurry images entered his consciousness. This was almost worse than before, his stomach now wriggled dangerously, and a nagging pain grew at the base of his skull. He groaned aloud as an image flashed into his mind. Perhaps image was the wrong word, impression would be more accurate.

Half of his awareness saw pure darkness, the other half, light. It wasn't as simple as that though. It wasn't black vs white, it was presence and absence. It was opposed forces. It was balance.

Chris could sense frustration coming down the line. Evidently, he hadn't comprehended the message correctly.

Next, he saw a light so blinding that from his limp kneeling position, he instantly shut his eyes. It made no difference of course. His eyes had nothing to do with what he was seeing. However, after a moment or two the impression was mercifully dimming anyway, fading into darkness. For a while, there was a pleasant balance but ever the darkness grew. Finally, the light was no more. Darkness was all there was. It was as terrifying and empty as the light had been blinding. All he wanted was to shut his eyes and look away.

The presence knew he didn't understand. Chris could feel it's frustration. It could have made him understand in an instant but such contact would utterly destroy him. His thoughts were too simplistic. The entity weighed its next move carefully.

A woman Chris instantly recognised from forgotten childhood memories flashed into his mind. His mother.

She lay naked on a white stone floor, breast heaving, sweat on her brow. Her body was flushed beautifully and seed dripped between her thighs. His father was there, lying beside her, his member slick and softening against her warm skin. Around them, symbolic rings of various construction nestled in expanding layers on the floor. Some looked wooden, a few metal, and there was even one that was clearly liquid, somehow contained into the outline of a perfect sphere. To Chris, it was obviously part of some spell or ritual.

The presence was there too, hidden from sight but blindingly bright in his mind's eye nonetheless.

His parents kissed lovingly, pride and happiness evident in their expressions. The presence descends into his mother, sparking what Chris instinctively knew was his own life.

What did it mean? His dragon was just as confused. The presence had tampered with his conception?

"You did something to me?" Chris asked, suddenly finding his unsteady voice.

Affirmation. He felt the response immediately, though it was followed by the sense that he grasped only the most basic aspect of what he was being shown.

The presence changed topic again, encouraged by the recent success. It brought forward all Chris knew of magic. So began a review of every time he'd used it, intentionally or not. He saw from the dragon's perspective for the first time. Felt how he used iron-willed intention to direct energy. It was so instinctual, so ingrained. Suddenly he grasped that the dragon had no understanding of the process, only that he had the ability to do it.

What then is magic? How does it work?

Next, memories from his high school textbooks flashed into mind. Pages of text and colourful images depicting things like molecules, atoms, and waveforms. He'd never been much of a science buff, though he had found the subjects interesting enough. His knowledge there was also sadly lacking by the entity's estimation but Chris still managed to draw a tenuous connection.

How the hell could science explain magic? Wasn't that the whole point, that it defied scientific logic?

A resounding yes echoed back at him as the presence read his confused thoughts. Chris knew he was asking the right questions, but God damn his head was really starting to feel like it was being split in two.

The presence began withdrawing reluctantly. It sensed an approaching threshold, a limit to his feeble endurance. It didn't want to damage him.

"Wait! What am I supposed to do?" Chris asked as it slipped away from him.

The only response was a faint glimpse of that first image, half darkness, half light.

He slumped onto the incorporeal floor, staring up at the grey ceiling. He lay there for a long time, muscles occasionally twitching as his headache gradually faded. Eventually he got up and made a start on getting his life back on track.

***

The sound of chirping night insects filled the muggy air and created a relaxing melody. It soothed the man in the cheap suit as he considered the news that had been trickling in all day. Denver was abuzz, the dragon grew powerful.

The heat didn't seem to bother him one bit as he sat on edge of the old wooden porch, a dilapidated mansion behind him. Every now and then, a deep red glow bloomed around the tip of his cigar. With it, thick smoke would cling near his face before dissipating reluctantly into the moist night air.

Radek sighed, faced with a difficult decision. He always had struggled letting go of things. He'd been held back by this flaw of character before. He had that nagging sensation that it was about to do so again if he wasn't careful. Still, he knew only one of the paths before him tickled his cold heart to the utmost.

He lay back on the rickety boards, stared at the stars, and let himself fall into fantasy. He followed that devious path, frolicking with childlike glee, a huge smile on his face. Yes, this was the path to take. Up ahead, as if seen through a shimmering haze of possibility, he bathed in a pool of rich gore, triumphant, and once again master of his true form.

He saw the pool ripple and twitch near the centre, something grew within. His heart soared as he recognised her by only the tips of her spiral horns, watching in awe as her resplendent form breached the thick surface. Her eyes were open even as she rose through the blood. The pleasure on her usually terrifying countenance told him instantly that he had indeed earned her favour. That she would sully her perfection by taking physical form was a temptation calling to him like a siren.

Those eyes. Those all seeing, lidless eyes were the most beautiful thing he would ever behold.

Behind him, the great purple beast keened his death note, the last of his lifeblood gurgling richly down into the pool to mingle with that of the insignificant others. How fitting that a glimpse of her perfection was the last thing he would see.

Radek smiled wistfully as he found himself back on the porch, an incessant erection tenting his suit pants.

He chuckled. The bright presence he'd detected earlier, that tell-tale trace of the enemy, was cause for caution. It had disappeared so quickly that he was inclined to disregard it for now. Besides, the reward he'd seen down that wonderful path would have had him swimming through acid if he'd thought it would bring him an inch closer to fulfilling his goal.

He looked down at his crotch again, still tented and not showing any sign of going away. Who could blame it after catching a glimpse of her. Perhaps it could be put to use though, he did enjoy the effect his enthusiastic attentions had on these pitiful human creatures. Their screams were music to his ears and their life force would provide him rich sustenance, prepare him for what was to come. Besides, it was time he started collecting.

It was delightful to once again bask in his true nature. The careful tiptoeing he'd been forced to for the past two years disgusted him.

He picked himself up and brushed the dust off his back. Briefcase in hand, he snubbed the cigar on the desiccated wood of the porch and turned towards the faint lights of the small town just a few miles away.

***

Lillian was back the very next morning, dragging Chris' bulky frame to the gym and putting him through his paces over and over. She didn't volunteer where she'd been and Chris took that as a sign to not ask. Her glee in punishing him out on the practice mats seemed to have grown if anything.

His ill-fitting clothes distracted him, making him an easy target for her blows. A couple t-shirts still fit, the ones with elastic materials integrated into the fabric, like the one he wore now. The rest of his clothes looked comical, if he could even get them on. Damn, he was going to have to buy more shit today.

"Pay attention," the full-bodied vampire landed a smarting blow against the side of his head, sending his ear ringing. She'd missed seeing him change back into this larger human form and was interested to assess his new limits.

"Sorry, there's a lot rattling around in here this morning," Chris replied, tapping his head and recovering his stance just outside her range.

She lunged forward immediately with a wicked knee and Chris barely recognised her intention to grapple him. His training took over. He stepped slightly to the side, absorbing part of the impact with his thigh, turning her aside. He slipped away from her grasping, deadly fingers and managed to find a firm grip on the back of her neck. As she sailed by, he added his strength to her momentum and rode her down onto the floor, hard. He landed on top of her, a knee in her lower back and his other hand locking one of her fingers threateningly in a hold she'd taught him.

Lillian was surprised to find her face pressed firmly into the mat, it's plastic, sweaty scent smothering her senses. Her breasts throbbed painfully, having received much of the impact. She ignored the discomfort and quickly attempted to throw him off with a powerful buck of her hips before he had a chance to secure his position. Unfortunately, her strength didn't avail her this time. Instead his grip simply got tighter.

<em>Interesting</em>. She drew more strength, digging deep enough to feel her inner beast stir and rumble dangerously. She wriggled powerfully, attempting to get one of her knees under her. All it got her was a warning growl and a very sore finger. If she'd been fighting for her life, embracing that darkness and sacrificing her finger would have been the natural choice.

Locked in such a compromising position, Lillian might have conceded the dragon a point and reset their practice bout. The very Idea chafed her, a frustrated grunt escaping her as she struggled vainly. Perhaps it was his obviously increased strength and her own answering draw of vampiric power which drove her to it but silently, a twenty-kilo weight ring from the stack servicing the bench press in the adjoining gym room rose into the air. It was heavy, at the limits of her ability in both weight and distance. She pulled it to her roughly with a mental jerk.

"Give it up, Lillian," he chuckled maddeningly. "I've got you trussed like a..."

The weigh struck his shoulder, thankfully flat face first before it grazed over the top of his head to clatter into the opposite wall. The impact sent him sprawling across the matts, stunned, the breath whooshing from his lungs.

She was on him in a flash, straddling his chest then wrapping her entire body around his arm and falling next to him on the floor. Her lithe form contorted, tugging his limb in way the left his foggy mind no doubt she could and probably would break it if he didn't submit. Still, it wasn't all bad. The luscious skin of her bared thighs almost smothered his face. He could smell her sweat and excitement, she was getting off on their mock battle. Even better, his forearm was lodged snugly in a plush valley of cleavage, separated only by the sweat-moist grey cotton of her sportswear tank top. What a way to lose an arm.

"Who's trussed up now, young one?" she panted.

"Me, I guess. That was dirty, Lillian," he accused groggily. He hadn't seen what had hit him like a freight train, his head was still wringing, but he was sure it wasn't part of a fair fight.

"Yeah? What are you going to do about it?" she laughed at his accusation and flexed her torso up to contort his arm a little more.

Chris let out a hiss of pain and thought back to what she'd taught him about getting out of such a hold. It wasn't going to work, she had him good and was his equal in strength. That left... he smiled.

Whilst his arm was painfully immobilised, his hand still had a little wiggle room. He pinched the soft upper swell of her left breast, eliciting an indignant screech from the voluptuous vampire. He'd never been that bold with before and it clearly startled her. Her grip loosened, and he used the opportunity to vanish into the Ether.

Lillian looked around the now empty room, a bemused little smile on her lips. The air was still thick with his heady scent and she could feel his muted presence lingering nearby, stalking her from his mysterious realm. Her body quivered almost imperceptibly, this was a man who could match her.

"I can fight dirty too," he said with amusement from directly behind her.

She whirled to find him ready, in a fighting stance, a snarl on her face. They stared at each other for a few moments, two deadly Beings squaring off; to fight or fuck neither were sure in that moment.

Lillian was about to spring at him when she recognised the feral instincts coursing through her for what they were. The vampiric beast inside her was dangerously unchained and taking hold of her body. She began fighting a fierce internal battle, forcing the writhing, screaming, dark entity back into its prison deep within her. Her body slackened with the effort but she was ultimately triumphant. It was a frightening experience, reminding her that she must always be in control around the temptations of the dragon.

The boy had a worried look on his face, he'd obviously seen something of her internal struggle. His concern both touched and shamed her. Good thing she'd indulged in fresh blood last night, borrowing one of her few friend's familiars to quell her cravings with the gluttony of fresh blood. Without it, who knows what she might have done a few moments ago.

"Sink slightly lower on your legs, Chris, and pull that left elbow in a little," she critiqued his stance harshly to distract him. "No more abilities for today, I got a little carried away there."

"Okay," Chris agreed a little confused with his vampire instructor but letting it go. There was something else going on, he could see it in her eyes.

"Good. Your strength has obviously improved but that's to be expected I guess," She paused, cocking her head as if to assess him in a new light. The boy, no, the man was almost as broad as Oslo across the chest. Oslo was a god-damn werebear. Chris was taller now too, meaning his muscles had increased in both length and volume. This body of his was her canvas and she was going to paint a masterpiece of combat. She smiled viciously, the tiniest hint of her Russian heritage seeping into her voice. "Okay then, let's see how you handle my speed!"
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
Without any more warning, she launched into a relentless series of lightning attacks. This time, she kept hawk-like focus on her task and a savage grip on her treacherous instincts.

She didn't let up for half an hour.

Chris' was wheezing when she finally called it quits after taking his breath from him with a skillfully executed strike targeting his diaphragm.

"How," he panted. "How can you fight for so long? I could keep up in the beginning but you just wore me down again and again."

"Oxygen. You need it, I don't," she replied with a broad smile, releasing her sweaty brown hair from its pony tail and shaking it out in preparation to hit the showers. "You did well to keep up for so long, I admit. However, I run on blood whilst you need oxygen and have to wait for your cells to convert food into energy. You'll only tire a vampire by forcing them to use their reserves to the last, at which point they will become very weak. The best way to do that would be to force them to regenerate, it requires a lot of energy. So there you have it, if you're fighting a vampire, don't draw it out and don't hesitate to get brutal. Rip an arm off or something."

"That's messed up," he watched her run her fingers through her long hair. "Hang on, if you don't need oxygen, why are you sweating?"

"Good observation, Chris. It's interesting actually. Our cells are technically dead by human standards but retain a lot of their function through the parasite that is transferred in our venom and our blood. It takes over the functions of the body at the moment of death using an entirely different biochemistry based on the life force of the blood we consume. The longer a vampire lives, the more potent they become. They've had more time to consume blood and the parasite has multiplied and strengthened for hundreds of years. We still sweat as a cooling method, as using energy creates heat. As you already know, we don't fare to well with heat, fire, and especially sunlight."

"That's sort of cool I guess. It would also be a bit of a giveaway if all you needed to do to spot a vampire was force everyone on a five-mile run and see who didn't shed a drop."

"Yes, there was a time several hundred years ago when some powerful vampires were reckless in their habits. Humans were on the brink of catching onto us. They were dealt with eventually and a dedicated misinformation campaign soon took care of any suspicious humans, leaving behind all the myths and vampire culture you see today. That's the basis for garlic, crosses, and holy water which are entirely ineffectual. Though I admit that too much garlic can taint the flavour of a human's blood.

"I'm sure Annabel would love to hear that. I bet she'd start feeding it to all of us just to tease you," Chris chuckled tiredly.

"I suppose she would," Lillian smiled. It would do the girl no good, the dragon's scent would still intoxicate her. "Okay, Chris, let's get cleaned up so we can get breakfast. You did tire me this morning, I just don't show it until I've got nothing left."

When they got back to the hotel suite, Chris went to the bedroom to change. He quickly spotted Annabel's handiwork cello-taped to the headboard of their bed. She'd printed something that looked like a warning placard. It was complete with a big red crossed ring and WARNING in large type across the top. He didn't recognise the picture inside the red ring from across the room, so he moved closer. It was a stylised vagina.

The fine text read: Warning. Tampering with pussies is illegal. Common-fucking-decency provides for penalty of blue balls until the end of time, or a $3200 fine for tampering with pussy in this bed or disabling pussy-tampering detection devices.

He howled with laughter and Susan popped her head in the door to see what the commotion was about. Chris couldn't spare the breath, so pointed to the sign.

Soon Susan was laughing too which brought Annabel from the kitchen where she'd been preparing breakfast.

"We'll see who's laughing in a few days," she threatened before scampering back to monitor the stove.

"It wasn't very thoughtful, Chris. Be careful with magic, please?" Susan cautioned him when they'd calmed down.

"I know, Mom, it was stupid and dangerous and disrespectful in the extreme. I keep apologising and she says she's forgiven me but that I can't go unpunished. Which is fair, I think."

"Well, I've been asked to support your punishment as a show of solidarity. No nookie for you," She spoke before leaning down to whisper hotly in his ear. "But if it gets too bad you know where to find me."

After gathering for Annabel's delicious French toast and berry compote, the dragon's brood split to their various appointments.

Michelle was about to go back into planning meetings. Allied governments worldwide were allocating resources to the Revelation and it was a huge undertaking. Her goal for the morning was to screen three key candidates and work on updating the dossier given to new recruits. That would be relatively relaxing. The afternoon, however, was going to be high strung. Yesterday she, with Reyla's help, had soothed things over between the Synod and some ruffled higher-ups in the government-military complex regarding Chris' unauthorised activities above Alaska.

Michelle's plan had gone well so far and Reyla even seemed a little impressed. After a little colluding with some of her counterparts in other organisations, Michelle convinced her superiors to push for Chris to answer to the US government for his actions with Reyla having the final word on the execution of any suggested reparation.

This was all very new to everyone. Such an event would previously have been charmed out of existence by a Synod appointed specialist or left in the hands of the local territory authority such as Reyla herself. Also, now that the humans were involved, there had to be some sort of communication whenever an issue arose from a Being-Human clash.

As Michelle left the apartment, Chris, Annabel, and Claire were preparing to hit the Being district's shops in search of larger clothes for Chris. Susan had suggested over breakfast that they enquire about altering his existing wardrobe magically so that was on the list too.

It wasn't a particularly warm morning but felt like it could get hot later. The sky was clear with barely a whisper of a breeze as the trio exited onto the quiet street at the back of the hotel. Their invisible vampire shadow followed closely, but tried to be unobtrusive, preferring to watch the dynamic between the three rather than participate.

Annabel quickly inserted herself against the dragon's side as they began to walk the short distance to the highest concentration of stores.

The young dragoness, bedecked in skin-tight stretchy jeans and a thin turtleneck sweater on top, held back a few steps, unsure if taking his other side would be appropriate. When he noticed, Chris looked back over his shoulder at her and beckoned her closer. The beautiful redhead beamed at him as she pushed in close and felt his large hand settle on her lower back.

Claire couldn't help her heart fluttering, her hand hovering over her belly button as she caught a thick waft of his scent. This is what she'd been missing all these years, a mate. It was extremely satisfying to her dragon instincts to be held so possessively and sense the new life growing inside her.

Annabel was a little surprised to see Chris openly display such affection in public but she realised this was part of his Being. She didn't expect him to ignore the other women in public, that would mean they were ashamed or hiding something. Besides, she thought with pride, one look at the body trying to rip that little t-shirt to pieces would leave no doubt in anyone's mind why he had a woman on each arm.

She smiled, marvelling at the masterful, unobtrusive way the magic surrounding her boyfriend was altering the very way she thought. She could recognise the influence but there was no sense of insidiousness or control associated with the thoughts, they felt genuine and usually delightfully sinful.

The trio did get a few looks from passer-by but they weren't so much disapproving. Surprise, mixed with a hint of envy or admiration seemed common as well as gaping at Chris' sheer size. Soon they arrived at the shop where Chris had purchased Annabel's wonderful black dress from. The little bell on the back of the doorway jingled happily to announce them.

Mary looked up from her sewing machine in the back of the shop. An excited tingle caressed her skin and goosed her arms wonderfully.

She sensed that a powerful aura had just entered her wards. Interestingly, was fluctuating unsteadily, dipping up and down in intensity as she cautiously peeked her head out onto the shop floor.

The witch couldn't help an excited squeak when she saw who was back in her shop again! She rushed forward to greet them.

"Chris, Annabel! I was hoping you'd return but this is a lovely surprise to have you so soon. What can I do for you today?" She paused, cocking her head towards the dragon conspiratorially. "Are you trying to hide your presence from me? If so, it isn't working."

"Not from you specifically, Mary, I'm just trying to practice masking it out in public," Chris said. "I'd like to introduce you to Claire Godran, we're recently mated."

"Hmm," the witch sighed dreamily. "It's nice to meet you Claire and congratulations, I heard some very joyful rumours floating around yesterday morning and I do hope they're true?"

"What have you heard?" The redhead asked, having a sinking suspicion that the chicken had flown the coop.

"Well, that you and your beautiful mother are both pregnant by this hunk of a man of course!" The witch was clearly excited at the prospect of getting a scoop on such a juicy piece of gossip and wasn't afraid to come right out and ask.

"That's a little rude, don't you think, Mary?" Lillian startled everyone as she emerged from invisibility and spoke for the first time in the morning's outing.

"Jesus, Lillian! You're going to give me a heart attack," Mary held a hand over her chest.

Claire glanced up at her mate quickly and decided to come out with the truth. There was no use trying to hide now, once the Being gossip mill started up, you were better to get ahead of things.

"It's okay Lillian," Claire said. "It is true. We were planning on keeping it quiet a bit longer but after Mom and Chris were seen together yesterday, I guess it wasn't hard for people to figure out what was going on."

"Yes hon, I'm afraid the floor of Reyla's court isn't the best place for a discreet encounter," Mary teased Chris. "Honey, you don't have to hold yourself back in my store, it's warded. Whatever goes on here is only barely detectable outside."

"I guess it would be nice to take a break, it's not easy holding it all down inside me, I don't have much practice at it yet," he replied.

As he slowly released his magic back up into its resting state, he could feel the uncomfortable fluctuations ease. It was content to no longer be imprisoned in his belly.

Mary was stunned to feel the radiance of his aura, she'd heard about this effect too but experiencing it first hand was the only way to do it justice. The dragon's warm magic flowed around her, trickling into her veins effortlessly. She sighed, feeling like she could happily float away into this warm embrace forever.

"Mary?" Chris watched the witch's eyelids flutter.

"Mary!"

"Oh, I'm sorry," she seemed to come back to herself. "Mmm, that is lovely, Chris. I'm so sorry you have to hide it, I wish you could share your gift with everyone."

"Thank you, perhaps one day I will. Listen, as you can see, I've grown a little since our last visit and not much fits anymore. I wasn't looking forward to buying a completely new wardrobe so Susan suggested I come here and ask if you would be interested in doing adjustments for me? I'd pay, of course," Chris asked politely.

"I'd be delighted to, Chris," Mary had to admit she would have struggled to refuse the dragon anything at that point, especially as his scent was now beginning to seep into her system too. She caught herself falling dangerously close to a state of intoxication and briefly warded herself against his influence. Unfortunately, this negated much of her ability to absorb his aura too. "I would be willing to wave my labour fees given your previous generosity. All I require is a payment for or even a direct trade of energy. I could get onto it right away. How does that sound?"

"It sounds fantastic. Thanks, Mary."

"I'll need to take your measurements, of course." The witch flicked her dark hair over her shoulder and gave Annabel a friendly smirk.

"Of course," Annabel rolled her eyes.

"You'll get used to this soon enough," Claire whispered into Annabel's ear, placing a friendly hand on her hip. "Doesn't it excite you though? Seeing her fawn over him but knowing he's all ours?"

Annabel gave a tiny, hesitant nod of her head and returned the dragoness' friendly smile.

Mary quickly retrieved her tape measure and notebook from the counter and sidled up to Chris with mischief in her eyes. From behind she measured across his shoulders, down his arm, around his neck and chest before scribbling down some figures in her little book. She glided in front of him and pulled herself close to reach around and measure his proportionately narrow hips, brushing her body into him ever so softly.

Finally, she sank to her knees, running a hand down the outside of his powerful, denim clad thigh as if she needed the support. Looking up, she made a show of holding the notebook between her teeth to free both hands. She held one end of the tape low on his ankle. The other slid slowly up the inside of his leg, contacting him occasionally and sending nervous jolts up his body.

Chris couldn't help watching her full, red lips as she blatantly teased him. His primal instinct was to reach down and guide her to something that would really smear that sultry lipstick of hers. It was much stronger than he'd felt the pull before whilst in human form. He was very tempted indeed, knowing with a dragon's confidence that he could pull such a bold move off.

His human side still had a say in it though, and was nervous to feel that gentle sensation of her hand creeping up his thigh. When his member gave a mighty twitch right next to her hand, he lost his nerve. His hand shot forwards to prevent her touch, embarrassed and unwilling to continue her game.

"I'm sorry, I got carried away," Mary blushed, dropping the notebook onto the floor as she looked into his face and saw his discomfort. It was so easy to forget he was so young, so easy to get swept away in his presence.

"It's not your fault, Mary," Chris diffused as he released her hand.

She finished more professionally and darted the two women and the vampire a guilty look as she finished her notes and took stock of his full measurements.

"Damn! You have been eating your oats, haven't you! Hmm, let me think about this. What sort of items do you want modified?"

"Pretty much everything I have here in Denver, it's two suitcases full," Chris answered.

"Okay and how would you like to trade?" she asked.

"We came better prepared this time," Lillian brought forward Chris' little black bag and placed it on the nearby counter. She'd been concealing it along with herself.

Chris revealed three medium sized quartz crystals, the product of his efforts with Susan over the last week or so. They were faintly infused with his purple essence, indicating that they were saturated with energy. The bag still held his treasure trove of dragon gold but he was resolved to hold onto it for big ticket purchases. Besides, it was good to be self-sufficient, using the magical currency of his own creation.

Mary held her hand over each crystal in turn, enjoying the sensation of the rich, vigorous magic. It was vital and eager to leap up into her fingertips, superlative quality.

"Two will be more than sufficient," she sighed, almost reluctant to admit it. "I should be able to resize and make your clothes stain proof. I will return the empty crystals, of course."

"Great. Thanks, Mary. We'll get them sent over to you right away. Perhaps you could work on a set of jeans and a few shirts first thing so I can wear them to this meeting I've got in the afternoon? Oh, can you do shoes too?"

"Yes, that's fine Chris. I'll have you something to wear by midday and I'll throw in some shoe resizes on the house. They aren't my specialty, but I'd hate to send you somewhere else," Mary smiled and picked up her two chosen crystals, placing them delicately on a velvet covered tray she kept just behind the counter.

"Thank you, Mary," Annabel spoke as they turned to leave.

"It was nice to meet you," Clair smiled.

After returning to the hotel and handing over Chris' suitcases to the concierge service for delivery, Annabel dragged them all back out to a beautiful café she'd spotted previously.

They sat enjoying the late morning sunshine for well over an hour in a little back garden that Annabel instantly fell in love with. Claire ordered a fresh juice but Chris and Annabel sampled the café's wonderfully smooth and skillfully brewed coffee. They chatted amiably as the girls took the chance to get better acquainted. Lillian assured them that the café was fully shielded from casual human suspicion. They were free to talk about anything they didn't mind being overheard by any nearby Beings.

Both women were highly passionate in their own ways and clearly driven. Chris could already see Annabel beginning to look up to Claire as a friend from some of her mannerisms he'd observed during high school.

They discussed their plans for the rest of the summer. Claire was happy to take the time to get to know Chris and the new city she would be living in. Besides, she would be settling into a long pregnancy, all too soon, her nesting instincts would kick in. Still, she hoped to find some online courses to enroll in. Eventually, she wanted to return to a position like she'd had at the medical clinic in San Diego before her move. The urge to provide aid to all, Being or human, ran strong in her veins. That would be on hold indefinitely though, she was soon to be a mother.

Chris wanted to continue absorbing as much information and training as he could before the hectic and uncertain times the Revelation was bound to bring. He also recognised the need to provide for his growing family, they couldn't rely on Reyla's generosity and protection indefinitely.

Annabel on the other hand was still keen to find a kitchen job before her classes started in the fall. If she could stay on part time while she attended cooking school, that would be a huge financial boon. Chris tried to persuade her to consider holding off on the job for now. He wanted her to learn more about Beings and magic, especially her link with Bartholomew.

Ever since she'd made that heartfelt plea to her little protector and felt him respond, he'd been very obedient and agreeable. That didn't mean he wasn't still mischievous as hell but he would listen to her and follow instructions. There had also been no more unexplained outbursts of magic, which gave Annabel a lot more confidence to be in public without him causing trouble.

Annabel was torn, she understood the importance of learning more about this new world but she was also passionate about continuing her dream. Going to culinary school and beginning her career as a chef would give her something productive to do. She didn't want to let go of that because she knew it was her calling.

Midday was upon them before they realised it. They collected Chris' first instalment of modified clothes from Mary. He changed in the back room and couldn't help but wonder at the witch's skill to get everything so perfectly sized. The clothes fit like they'd been tailor made, which he supposed they almost were.

They parted ways back at the hotel, Chris receiving affectionate kisses from both girls before Lillian had to strong arm him down to one of Reyla's offices for this meeting.

***

"Young man, Michelle speaks very highly of you and your commitment to this process," President Falconer addressed Chris sternly through the video call. "I understand that you were in a satiation of duress when the event happened, and it was part of you coming into your powers more fully. Heck, I remember the turmoil I felt at your age and I was only worried about girls and fast cars! However, we can't be seen playing favourites and you did give our boys up in Alaska quite a scare. Thankfully we got control of the situation before it spread too far but this could have been a disaster. We're calling it an emergency intervention against a malfunctioning satellite. I'm always amazed by these cover stories they come up. The Russians didn't buy it so we had to tell them what really happened but everyone else seems to be in the dark. Thankfully they're fully on-board with this Revelation, it sure helps that the vampire families have got deep connections over there."

"I'm sorry, Sir," Chris was truly repentant. It was only now that he'd had it all laid out before him that he realised how much trouble he could have caused.

"Not to worry my boy, the wonderful agent Hamund has convinced me to try this her way so here's what we are offering. You're going to work for us! As well as these promotional thingies those media airheads have cooked up, you're going to start training to deploy with some of our field teams. My generals are bugging me about the need to have Beings we can count on to assist us if we come up against supernatural threats. You spooked them pretty good and they seem to think anyone who can dodge one of their THAAD missiles is worth trying to recruit."

"Aren't you worried about my loyalty or what people will think when they find out you're using Beings offensively? I'm not going to be some mindless grunt who goes around doing your dirty work, Sir," Chris didn't like the sound of this idea very much.

"It's not going to be like that, Chris," Michelle placed her hand on his forearm to calm him. "You'll be working with us at the Being Interaction Agency. You'll mostly be doing public relations stuff and helping wherever you can. We would only ask you to go into combat in the direst situation and you'll be fully briefed beforehand."

"That's right," the President continued. "From what I understand, we couldn't very well order you to do something you didn't want to do anyway, given your abilities. We need someone on our side, Christopher. We need someone who is willing to help us if the Synod is unable or unwilling to, especially when it comes to some of the more unstable governments around the world. Michelle tells me you care about humans more than most. I think this is a good way for you to help your country and make sure this Revelation is as smooth as possible. Oh, did I mention you'll be paid top dollar with diplomatic benefits?"

"No, you didn't," Chris raised an eyebrow and glanced at Michelle.

"I've been brought up to speed on your species' endangered status, Chris," the President continued, eager to sell the young man on the idea now that he'd gained his interest. "I understand you're going to be a father soon too. We will do everything we can to keep you safe and make it worth your while. Your beautiful Lady Narlakis has agreed to provide resources for your protection while you're with us too and you'll be surrounded by our very best."

Chris now looked over to Reyla, seated silently by the door with a look on her face that indicated her mind was digesting other things. She nodded subtly to him.

"What about if this whole thing went to shit, Sir?" he asked.

Robert Falconer sighed heavily and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Even thinking about that possibility gave him nightmares, he was still half expecting to wake up one morning and not remember who he was.

"I would expect you to protect your family above whatever agreement we work out here. I wouldn't ask you to betray your people but I would also hope you wouldn't actively attack us. No one wins in that situation."

"Good," Chris said. He was starting to see where Michelle had been going with this all along. It was clear the US government was desperate to get their hands on some supernatural resources. He couldn't blame them but he could take advantage of them. It was just as Michelle suggested. "Okay then, why don't we get all this in writing and we can go from there?"

"Done," the President couldn't contain his smile.

***

With the meeting over, Reyla retreated to her study, brooding over current events as she had taken to of late. The dragon was an anomaly, dumped unceremoniously in her lap on the eve of this debacle with the humans. The entire situation stank of a larger scheme in play and it maddened her overactive mind to not see how the puzzle pieces fit together.

"In all our histories, have you ever heard of a dragon like this one, cousin?" Reyla broke what had been an hour's silence in her dark study. The only light source came from the suspended orb her cousin was reading by, illuminating him in sharp contrast.

"No," Arvil looked up over his glasses at Reyla, putting down the thick tomb he'd be scouring. "I have been searching for reference of other Beings who were similarly unique. Listen to this one."

He picked up another ancient book, this one small with a cracked red leather cover. He flicked carefully through the delicate pages, searching for the passage he'd spied before. Though Reyla maintained her treasures religiously, books this old could never be replaced so he handled them with the utmost respect.

"Here it is. Ahem... In the decades of war following the Great Flight, magic was weak in the new world. The ones who had fought the Darkness gave unto the elves instruction to prepare a ward. One which it was said would hold back the forces of darkness forever.

Preparation took many years, for the ward was so vast it would protect the entire world, both magic and savage alike. The Darkness launched mighty effort to destroy the ward before it was completed but were rebuffed, again and again. Weakened as they were by their battles with the Light and the long absence from their dark realm, the dark servants still threw themselves against the elves with unholy zeal.

Eventually the great ward was prepared, though the elves and allied races paid dearly in blood. Once again, they summoned those divine creatures, this time to activate the barrier. They were refused. Those great powers could not intercede directly for their own laws forbid it.

The elves despaired, for all was surely lost.

In the bleak days that followed, a strange man, great of stature, presented himself to the elfin court. It was said that all who looked upon him were rendered dumb, for he was a vessel overflowing with power. He declared he would activate the ward himself. The price? To sire a child, for he had none to carry on his bloodline. The matriarch of dragons offered herself without hesitation and he took her there, in front of the entire assembly.

The man wasted no time fulfilling his promise. The great ward was activated with a violent detonation of pure light. Those few who looked directly upon the conflagration were blinded and spouted madness for years to come. When the spell faded, the man was gone. His clothes, burnt and ruined, were all that was left of him, save the child growing in the dragon's belly."

"Interesting," Reyla purred when her cousin was finished. "The Barrier had been in place millennia before I was born. I remember my tutor teaching my sisters and I it was activated by a willing sacrifice, that most powerful source of magic. I have not heard the story told in such detail before, but the author of that book was known for his creative embellishments in other works. You are correct, though, the man described does bear resemblance to our dragon. Still, detail is vexingly absent. What sort of creature was that man?"

"Unknown. Perhaps we could research this matriarch of dragons? Surely there is a record of her and her offspring somewhere?" Arvil loved a good magical conundrum and this was proving to be a tricky one indeed.

"An interesting thought, dragonesses do not usually mate with other species. If there was a child from that union, it would be incredibly unlikely it was also a dragon. If there is a record, you know where it will be," Reyla's resentment was clear in her last sentence.

"Ah, yes. So, we shall assume it is out of reach?" Arvil asked.

"Unfortunately, yes. I am unwilling to pay the price those haughty fools would demand for access to their precious library. Besides, they are currently the largest threat to our dragon. I'm surprised they haven't tried to wrest his custody from me already. The one who orchestrated his father's death still lives. I know for a fact he is responsible for others too, but he hides behind his family's power."

"Hmm, an impasse then," the brown skinned elf mused with steeped fingers.

"It is the timing that worries me most," Reyla complained. "It cannot be coincidence that he just popped up out of nowhere at this moment like some sort of prairie dog. We stand on the most monumental change to our world since the Barrier itself, possibly since our ancestor's mysterious arrival to this world."

"True, that is worrying. There is no doubt this Revelation will be written of as a cataclysmic event in both societies. I still wonder how this Radek kept his activities from the Synod just long enough to make the memory charm nigh useless. It is also concerning that the dragon became embroiled in the issue so quickly."

"Not to mention his penchant for reproduction," Reyla said dryly.

"Indeed, that shouldn't be overlooked. You've spoken with Elizabeth Guthrie, what does she say of him siring two hatchlings inside a week?" Arvil asked.

"Ha! She clucks like a broody mother hen and considers it a blessing. There is little we can do for now except watch him closely and provide guidance and protection as we can."

"A fair assessment, to act rashly or in haste could be disastrous. I will continue researching and arrange for our lessons to begin shortly," Arvil paused weighing his next words carefully. For a stretching moment, he hesitated to voice them for fear of his cousin's temper. "What about his power, surely you've thought of having it for your own?"

"Of course I have," Reyla shivered. "Have you not seen what he does to those women? He has bound them tighter than I have ever managed by contract, lash, or collar. I do not wish to fall into that same trap."

"Still, something tells me you will not avoid it forever," the smirk in his tone was subtle but apparently not subtle enough.

"Out!" she hissed, unwilling to abide his teasing impudence in her own study.

"Yes, beloved cousin," Arvil stood slowly and bowed, mockingly deep, before taking his leave.

Reyla fidgeted uncomfortably, simmering, knowing she had only risen to his bait. Still, he raised valid concern. Could she resist the temptation of the dragon's power? Worse, was that temptation only a siren's call. If she answered, could she maintain her independence, her identity, her power? Or would she simply be absorbed into his brood, another willing mare in the young stallion's stable?

***

Several days later, Chris was relaxing, belly down on the couch. Annabel's slim body lay along his back, warm, heavy, and comforting. She was using him as her own sofa of sorts. Before him, his tablet displayed an explanation of the elemental groups of the periodic table and their generalised properties. He couldn't help being fascinated by the sometimes-explosive reactivity of the alkali metals in particular.

Educating himself about some of the fundamentals of science had consumed his spare moments for days now. Ever since his encounter with that unknown entity, he'd been reliving its confounding messages again and again. He couldn't make heads or tails of what it all meant but it had shown him images of what he was starting to realise were the building blocks of everything. Physics, chemistry, and to some extent biology held renewed fascination for him.

The format of information he gleaned from various websites was different to what had been drummed into him in class at high school. It was easy to learn when everything was right at his fingertips and a multitude of videos were available explaining almost any tricky concept he came across. Further, the more advanced concepts he was discovering, which might have been glossed over in science class, gave him a fuller picture. It was like a whole new world was waiting for him to discover, on top of the magical one he'd just stepped into. He was determined to up his game so he could discover why that strange visitor had invaded his mind and what it wanted.

He'd told Annabel about that unnerving encounter. Instantly he could tell that she hadn't grasped the gravity of his experience. Perhaps he'd explained it poorly. To be fair, it was hard to do it justice with words. She seemed to write it off as some sort of inconsequential vision or dream, distracted as she was by his unseemly use of magic on her privates.

Her lack of understanding made him shy away from attempting to tell the others. Thinking of telling Reyla especially gave him an uneasy feeling, even though she was probably his best shot. Better to wait and see how things developed, the elf had her hands full.

At the back of his mind, a terrible thought lurked. Had he been magically compelled? There was no doubt the entity had the means, his mind had been open before it. Was the newfound obsession with understanding the physical universe, magic, and his inability to convey his experience with the entity his own? The thought stoked a flickering anger inside him. It made him all the more determined.

Though the visit from that mysterious visitor had given him only questions, one thing was becoming clear. His transformation was not normal. Not dragon standards or any other standards for that matter. He'd only just been accustoming himself to the dragon's added strength, heightened senses, and increased... libido brought on by his first transformation to hybrid form. Then this went and happened.

Now he was a veritable giant. People openly gawked at him as he passed by, making him feel uncomfortable to leaving the confines of the apartment. He was sure some unknowing human was going to call him out as something alien, yell at him to fuck off back to whatever planet he'd come from or something similar. It never happened though, instead they tended to stare at him dreamily. God help him if he stayed in a confined space with a woman for more than half an hour, they became lust-filled, uninhibited creatures.

Almost worse, was the open reverence in the eyes of most lower Beings who felt his unobscured aura. It bordered on worship and that was intolerable. He already had Susan researching a high-powered antidote potion he would be able to carry with him to negate his own intoxicating effect.

His dragon, while confused as to the how, was of course pleased with the majesty of their new form. It only confirmed what he'd known all along, that they were indeed magnificent. To be adored or feared completely, they were the superior specimen of dragon prowess. The dragon's happy conceitedness infuriated Chris at times, especially when he found himself caught up in his ever-lecherous fantasies. Daydreaming of repopulating the entire dragon race, one nubile body at a time was a particular favourite. Another, becoming a total man whore and ravaging every woman haplessly ensnared by his pheromones, being or human.

His physical strength had ratcheted up yet again. He was learning to move carefully and deliberately by default after two broken door handles, a dent in the drywall, and at least three pieces of ruined cutlery. He also had to get used to the added height, at 6'6'' without shoes, he barely fit through a standard door and would bump his head painfully if caught at the wrong part of his stride. Ducking felt unnatural but was becoming part of his routine out of necessity. His skull might be thick but it could only withstand so much punishment.

Annabel seemed to be less concerned than ever with his changes. In fact, using his massive body as her personal furniture was becoming a regular occurrence. Whether in bed, sitting in his lap, or even in public she was adamant about maintaining close contact. He didn't particularly mind, except that her charms were currently off limits as part of his punishment. Having her using him as body pillow was undoubtedly arousing, leading to mounting sexual frustration. He didn't know how much longer he could stand it. Sooner or later he would have to sneak off to see Susan in the middle of the night for some covert, much-needed release.

Right now, she was using his body like some sort of heated settee. She played noncommittally on her phone whilst looking over his shoulder as he surfed Maginet and buffed up on the basics of atomic structure. She'd been intermittently teasing him for the last half hour and apparently it was time to begin again.

She wet her lips and traced them up the side of his powerfully muscled neck from the collar of his t-shirt. Reaching his ear, she nuzzled and breathed warm across the soft skin and began lip-nibbling his lobe. Her hips bucked involuntarily into his lower back in obvious arousal. An exasperated little chuckle escaped him in reply to her excited antics.

"I thought I was the one being punished. How long are you going to keep it up?" Chris was of course referring to his current punishment of zero penetration by order of his vengeful lover. His hidden erection was currently molesting the leather couch cushions below, but he was trying to play it cool with Annabel. She always seemed to work herself up more than she bargained for.

"Until I think the magic finishes working," she whispered directly in his ear.

Chris froze at her words. An excited twitch raced up his already steely shaft, probably making an unseemly wet spot in his shorts.

"Seriously?" He asked conspiratorially, turning his face towards her, the article he'd been reading forgotten.

"Yeah, I noticed this morning putting my underwear on."

"Oh my god, can I see?" He dropped the tablet and squirmed around so he was facing her, plopping her back on top of him. Now she was sitting on the impressive erection tucked up into his waistband. His hands found her prominent butt and began kneading the soft flesh provocatively.

"Perv," laughter sparkled in her rich hazel eyes. "If I let you see her, I know you won't be able to resist."

"I promise. I'll be good," Chris pleaded jokingly. He couldn't describe how excited he was at the prospect of having Annabel again, he needed her.

"Mmmhh," She squirmed wantonly, enjoying his throbbing heat separated from her by only a few layers of cloth. "Tempting but let's wait a few more days. Who knows, if we're patient, you might get that whole fucking thing inside of me."

"Fuck, Dee!" he complained. "I really need you, don't you dare start with that sort of talk right now."

Her response was a wickedly delighted grin before she fell upon him in a searing kiss. Her lips were warm and moist against him, her tongue playful and not to be denied. He couldn't resist.

His phone rang loudly from the floor, the shrill tone indicating a Maginet connection.

Chris sighed in frustration, trying to extricate himself and answer. She resisted stoically, eager to ignore the distraction, continue their passion. In the end he had to take a firm grip on her lustrous chestnut pony-tail and firmly haul her upwards as he reached for his phone.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Unperturbed, Annabel beamed evilly down at him and began rolling her hips back and forth ever so slowly. She was so fucking horny. Thinking about what he'd done to her with his magic was making her excited these days rather than raising her anger. Bartholomew scuttled around happily too, very eager to have his mistress and creator reunited.

"Hello, Chris here," He answered breathily.

"Chris! Stephan Sibon. How are you my boy? I've found what I believe is the perfect property for your needs. Would you be interested in seeing it tomorrow?"

"Hi Stephan. Um, yeah, I think that could work, so long as it isn't too far away? I have an appointment in the late afternoon." Chris' voice reflected his sudden excitement, he hadn't thought he'd hear back from the werebison so quickly. Getting stuck into some real work and helping build his own home was something Chris was looking forward to immensely.

"Excellent," Stephan's voice seemed to be full of vigour as well. "I can pick you up at around 1pm and we can take my truck, I'll drop you back off when we're done so that will keep the time down."

"That sounds great. Do you have room for Lillian and Olso? I'm not sure who will come along but they don't let me go anywhere alone."

"Yes, plenty of room in the truck, even for Oslo. Though I hear from a certain young lady close to my heart that you've been spotted around town and it appears you'll be the one who needs to sit up front for the extra room."

"Yeah, there have been some changes. It will actually be my first time in a vehicle since the change so we'll just have to wait and see. Tell Hailey I said hello and not to believe everything on those god-damn gossip boards, it seems like that's all people use Maginet for," Chris hadn't been able to resist peeking in on the speculation surrounding him on the Being's magical communications network. There was some serious hero worship shit rearing its ugly head. These people didn't know him whatsoever but where taking great enjoyment from dissecting and speculating on every aspect of his life. It was a little creepy, but he was going to have to get used to it.

"Ha! That ship has sailed I'm afraid Chris, her mother is almost as bad and they seem to feed off of it like vampires. Okay, so tomorrow at one pm. I'm looking forward to getting started, I've got a good feeling about this place and I can't wait to sink my teeth in, figuratively of course."

"I'm excited as well, Stephan. It's been too long since I did something with my hands. See you tomorrow," Chris hung up to find Annabel stilled, watching him.

"So, when are you going to finally tell me about your plans, Mr Budding Architect?" she asked with a scowl.

He lent up, kissing her cute nose affectionately before depositing her nearby and swinging his feet to the floor.

"You know I want to keep that as a surprise, Annabel," He saw she wasn't satisfied with his response. "Okay, okay, I'll give you the basics. My biggest concern is security and discreetness and maybe it's just my dragon talking but to me that means building underground, like the Compound. I've hired Stephan to do most of the work and planning, but I'll be helping with labour. From what Oslo tells me, he's pulled off some seriously impressive projects. Other than that, I don't know yet."

"See, that wasn't so hard," Annabel smiled. "I'm fine with having a surprise but I'd rather not be kept in the dark completely."

"Fair enough, Dee."

"Master?" The sprite flitted out of the bedroom, woken from her nap by their voices.

"Yes, Immi?"

"It's almost time for your lesson with the chocolaty-elf-man. I would like to be fed first, please," Her tiny eyelashes batted up at him expectantly.

Chris had no intention of denying her but it was still fun to see that she put in the effort. A few moments of concentration later, Immi was munching away happily from her perch on his knee. She no longer pigged out quite as violently as she first had. Living with the dragon, she was growing accustomed to having as much sustenance as she could ever want. It was a sprite's dream come true.

Annabel watched her bring the cube to her perfect little lips, nibbling a corner delicately with her eyes closed in rapture. On her hand, Bartholomew seemed very eager about Immi. He was prancing back and forth, tail wagging, wings twitching. Perhaps he was curious what the little sprite was eating?

She reached forwards gently and the tattoo positioned himself right at her fingertip. Millimetres away from the sprite, a shock ran back up her arm and the room reverberated with a tiny pop.

The startled sprite opened her eyes to discover her precious morsel had vanished, a belligerent little dragon staring back at her.

"Thief!" Immi shrieked in outrage. "You nasty little thief-dragon!"

Bartholomew raced back up Annabel's arm in an attempt to find cover in the safety of her small bosom.

Annabel squawked as the angry sprite's tiny claws were unsheathed and she lunged after the tattoo.

Chris laughed, plucking Immi out of Annabel's armpit where she'd been trying to burrow her way underneath the Annabel's blouse to enact revenge. Annabel caught her breath, having almost been tickled to death by the two little creatures.

"Master he stole it!" Immi wailed, her little blue body quivering. Moisture gathered in her eyes, her pointy little elf's ears drooping dejectedly.

"I know, little one. I didn't know he could. Here, I'll make you another."

She instantly brightened, leaving Chris to believe that the tears she'd almost shed would have been decidedly crocodilian.

As Chris worked on replacing the sprite's meal, Bartholomew poked his head out from under Annabel's clothes tentatively.

"Bartholomew!" Annabel scolded. "That wasn't nice at all. Immianthe is a friend, just like Susan and Lillian and the other dragonesses. I want you to apologise to Immi right away."

The little dragon's tail went limp and his wings sagged in response. It was adorable, he clearly knew he'd been a bad boy. He looked at the sprite, holding his head low and bobbing it up and down a few times before rolling to expose his belly.

Immi stuck her tongue out at him and took a greedy bite from her fresh treat.

"Were you hungry, Bartholomew?" Chris leaned close to ask the little dragon on Annabel's wrist.

He nodded back.

"Annabel and I didn't know you needed to be fed. Please ask in the future whenever you're hungry, okay?" he asked.

"Maybe it's because we haven't been having sex?" Annabel wondered. "Susan says he grows with the energy you give me."

The dragon's little head popped up at the word sex and his tongue snaked out to scent the air hopefully. Annabel giggled.

"He is definitely very excited when we do make love and I have noticed him being a little subdued lately," She mused.

"Okay then, I'll make another cube for him now but maybe you should reconsider my punishment. There are cute, innocent, little creatures suffering because of your personal vendetta, Annabel," Chris couldn't keep a straight face and ended up laughing the last couple of words out.

"Hardy har," Annabel retorted. "You'd like the very much, wouldn't you?"

"Of course I would, Dee."

Chris focused on creating a third cube of the stable purple-grey energy. Completed, he placed it on Annabel's hand. Bartholomew was quick to gobble it up with a pop. They both watched in wonder as the cube was somehow pulled into the dragon's little cartoon universe where he scarfed it down with relish.

"I don't know if I'll ever forgive him but he is incredible," Immi chirped. "You two need to get back on schedule with the fucking! He's a growing boy and he needs regular meals."

"You try waking up with your pussy throbbing like crazy and this perv saying that he's put an enchantment on your snatch!" Annabel laughed.

"Mmhhh, so lucky, Mistress" Immi purred. "I would gladly endure any discomfort to be able to couple with Master. Furthermore, you are his familiar, he may do with you as he pleases."

"I can't win, I must be the bad guy here," Annabel threw up her arms in mock disgust.

Someone rapped loudly on the front door.

"That will be Arvil," Chris leaned over to kiss Annabel's temple, collected Immi, and got up. "We'll be back in a few hours."

"Okay, have fun Babe," She replied.

"Hey, where's Lillian? Is she supposed to come with me?" Chris couldn't sense the vampire's presence in her room or any of her other usual lurking spots. Normally she would have answered the door if she'd been here.

"She's working with the other security guys, remember? They're planning or strategizing or something down in the security office. She said you'd be okay because Arvil was collecting you and you weren't going outside the compound," Annabel replied.

"Okay, bye Dee."

Chris checked the door and opened it to greet Arvil who was patiently leaning against the opposite wall.

"Hey Arvil, sorry about the wait. I've had Immi and Annabel's enchantment, Bartholomew, fighting over food and Annabel is still busting my balls."

"You lead a tribulatious life, young Christopher," Arvil smiled at the large man.

"I know, right. It's not fair," Chris joked, placing Immi on his shoulder as they strode off down the corridor, their long strides eating up the richly carpeted distance.

This would be their third training session and Chris was looking forward to it. In the last two, Arvil, with Immi's insistent supervision, had been working Chris into exploring his powers. Those related to the Ether were the elf's special interest.

Arvil himself was an experience Ether mage and delighted to have the opportunity to take such a gifted student under his wing. They'd started out with some simple tests, observing Chris in his element, assessing the extent of his natural energy reserves, basic phasing, creative movement, the simplest direct energy attacks, the list went on.

Chris was also instructed thoroughly in concealing his presence and more importantly, being able to hold it in a relaxed state. It seemed like that was going to take a lifetime to master.

Arvil explained chakras to Chris, who'd heard the term before but never put any stock in the idea. The elf explained how mastering the flow between the energy centres of his body would unlock greater control and finesse of his abilities.

They practiced summoning energy quickly vs efficiently, both from inside himself and from the Ether. The sprite and elf duo also explained the basics of different techniques which could be used to cast spells. Through invocation of powerful ancient words, through runes and symbols, through conduit objects, through recipes and materials, and finally through intention.

Chris was already using intention to guide his magic, an advanced technique. They warned up one side and down the other about the dangers of errant thoughts, distractions, and strong emotions. All of which could all disrupt his ability or even have drastic and unforeseeable consequences when constructing a spell. Still, it was the method which dragons found instinctively at their use.

Arvil was learning too. He had to adjust his lessons on the fly. For instance, it was very unusual to have a student who didn't tire or deplete their energy in just a few simple spells. Chris could stay in the Ether indefinitely which was very refreshing to the experienced elf. He was used to complaints from his few students of how it sapped too much energy. Beyond that, the dragon's aura actually kept the elf's own reserves topped up during their lessons. This allowed him to demonstrate techniques without hesitation. It was a delight to use magic so freely and not be overly worried with replenishing his loss.

It was a different dynamic and Arvil understood this from the start. He was instructing a Being who was superior in talent but simply lacked experience.

Because of this talent, the lessons seemed to progress quickly and were quite fun for both student and teacher. Arvil found he liked the young man, who seemed very grounded and extremely modest for his power. Beings like Chris were usually old, serious, arrogant, and self-centred. The boy was the opposite.

They began today's session with quick fire phasing, trying to improve Chris' speed and accuracy to pinpoint levels. The key to success was clarity of the mind. The body was still involved, of course, and Lillian's brutal training helped Chris keep his breath as Arvil pushed him to phase around and around the room.

He popped into the Ether, sprinted to the next point, popped out, rang the little bell hanging in the corner, and popped back into the Ether before running on the next bell. Arvil had placed one in each of the four corners of the rectangular chamber as well as one suspended high on the ceiling. Chris' challenging work soon filled the space with happy jingling.

"Enough," Arvil called and Chris came back to stand in front of him, breathing heavily. "You're doing well so we're going to move on, you can practice this in your own time. You said your vampire explained how devastating correctly controlled phasing can be in combat so let's practice an advanced technique. You could already use your ability to reposition quickly, disorientate, escape, demoralize, etcetera etcetera. What I want you to practice now, is ringing the bells with only the tip of your finger. Ideally, the rest of you should stay in the Ether as much as possible. It will take a considerable amount of focus and speed to succeed. The key is to initiate the phase with your fingertip in mind, touch the bell, and at the same time abort the phasing and slip back in. You cannot purposefully leave the finger in the Norm and the rest of you in the Ether; it would probably fall off if such a thing were possible. However, the transition between Norm and Ether is not truly instantaneous across the whole body and this is what we exploit with this exercise."

It was hard, the hardest thing they'd practiced yet. Chris took several attempts to even be able to cancel his phase before he'd come all the way across. Damn you had to be quick! He found eventually that creating a pattern and planning his exact actions in advance was the key to making it possible. After an hour he was still not there, though he had improved to the point where sometimes only his arm or upper body would be visible for a tiny moment before he phased back into the Ether.

"What do you use this technique for?" Chris asked as they took a break and he drank some cool refreshments.

"That one is actually why phasing is considered unsportsmanlike in any sort of duel and why phase-users have such a deadly reputation. Never mind that only a very few ever master the technique, we are all branded with the same iron," Arvil began.

"That sounds about right for Beings," Chris muttered.

"It is not necessarily a bad thing. That false reputation grants even weaker ether-mages a measure of respect amongst other Beings. For instance, fear of my retribution has dampened the slights I otherwise might have received due to my mixed heritage. Especially when I was young, it saved me a few beatings from the older lads."

"That's terrible, at least it helped you."

"Indeed, a few demonstrations of my abilities as I grew dissuaded the bullies even further. But I wonder off topic...At least a thousand years ago, there was a young goblin who put his abilities to great use, thieving his way around Europe.

He could phase so quickly in and out of the Ether that it's said he could've lifted the purse off even an elder vampire. By accident, he discovered that the same technique could be used to kill with deadly speed, any unshielded or unsuspecting opponent. Of course, anyone who can phase can stick their hand in someone's chest and displace vital organs when they merge back. It's surprisingly ineffective against anyone with half decent training. The resistance involved in such a displacement makes the process slow, allowing time to move out of the way or activate a defensive charm. The young goblin's technique is devastating because the transition is initiated in such a small area, then cancelled immediately. This means there is far less resistance to the phase and very little time to react. An accurate nick to the heart, spine, brain, or major blood vessels can be instantly deadly."

"That's pretty brutal," Chris frowned, he knew his skills could be used to deadly effect. The fateful trip to Scotland was still fresh on his mind. This one that Arvil was teaching him seemed very unfair if it was so fast and hard to react to.

"Indeed. I would advise you never to use such a technique on another soul unless options are limited. Given your powers, there should always be another way to subdue an opponent," Arvil warned. "That goblin went on to become a master assassin and plagued the Synod for over fifty years. You would do well to use the technique for what it was first intended for, stealth. I can personally attest to its usefulness in lifting items from a person or interacting with objects whilst staying concealed."

"Okay, but when am I ever going to need to steal something?" he asked.

"You never know when such a skill may save the day, Master." Immi spoke up from her perch on top of a bookshelf. "I had to steal for many years just to stay alive by myself out in the Ether."

"Your case is perhaps on the extreme end of the scale my dear sprite," Arvil chuckled. "A more practical example I have found useful in recent years is to disable the human's cameras and security devices."

"Oh, cool. I hadn't thought of that. So, you could knock out a camera without it ever getting a glimpse of you?" Chris was right on-board with that. Having 007 level spy skills at his disposal sounded badass, not that he'd need to use them unless he was doing something illegal but you never knew.

"Correct. Have you ever read in the human's news when things go missing or get stolen and no one can explain how the thief pulled it off? It's usually Beings responsible," Arvil explained.

"Huh, I guess that makes sense. Hey Arvil, I was wondering, all these times I've been in the Ether why do things have a presence there? Immi's bookshelf, you, the bells, everything has a ghost of a presence. What's the reason?" Chris asked.

"That is indeed a mystery, Chris," the elf answered. "As you know, the presence is tangible, offering some resistance to push against or work with but still easily overcome. As to what causes it? I cannot give you a compelling answer except that all matter must be somehow inherently linked to the Ether on a fundamental level. At least that's how I explain it. There are many aspects of magic we cannot explain but that doesn't stop us from using them nonetheless."

"I understand that, it's like just because I can't explain the inner working of a combustion engine, it doesn't mean I can't drive a car. I just thought it would be cool to know," Chris couldn't help seeing a pattern emerging and wondered how widespread the issue was. How much magic was practised without understanding?

"Okay Chris, I think we'll stop here for today. I'll escort you back to your room and we can pick up again tomorrow and work on your remarkable teleportation."

"Thanks, Arvil, I had fun today, it was good to let off a bit of steam."

***

As it turned out, the property Stephan had found was a small old warehouse just outside what was considered the Being district. As he stepped out of the werebison's double cab pickup, Chris got a good feeling right away.

Lillian and Oslo were with them. He liked the company but did feel a bit guilty about taking up their time with babysitting him on his errands.

"So, what do you think?" Stephan asked, enthusiasm clear in his deep voice. Once the man stuck his horns into a project, it consumed him. It was a treat to be working with the dragon and he was really looking forward to it. His daughter Hailey had certainly never taken such an active role in prodding him into a job before.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 10|
--------------------------------------------
"I see the potential, Stephan. It needs a bit of tidying up though," Chris noted a little warily.

"I agree. It's a little rough and ready in appearance, hasn't been used for a good few years. You can see some of the brickwork around the base is deteriorating and there's rust on the roofing iron. I actually think you might like it looking a bit dilapidated. It will attract less attention. Besides, when you see some of the miracles I can work on a place like this, you'll come to love the extra character."

They continued discussing the merits of the place as they entered the property through a small gate in the chain link fence keeping it separated from the road. The building was a simple rectangle, short side to the street with a long driveway leading to a gravelled yard at the back of the lot.

Oslo and Lillian trailed behind a little as they progressed around the building, watching for anything amiss as the two men were oblivious to anything outside their little bubble of excitement.

Access to the interior was provided by a large automatic door at the rear of the warehouse, it was clear that the design allowed for a full-size truck to drive inside undercover. Once Stephan had retrieved the remote from a lock box, they opened it up and they stepped inside onto the vast concrete floor.

Diffuse natural light streamed in through many opaque skylights in the roof, creating a muted god-ray effect when it struck the dust hovering in the air.

Chris wondered at the size of the place. What was he going to do with it, and more importantly, how the hell was he going to pay for it?

"Stephan, I like the place but there's no point in getting my hopes up if I can't pay for it. What's the situation?" he asked.

"I hear you, Chris. The seller is a Being, which really works in our favour and is why I found it so quickly. He moved out to the East Coast Territory a year and a half ago and has been trying to sell it ever since. He even went to the trouble of stripping every shred of magic out of the place and listing it with the human realtors. I gave him a call and he's ready to make it move, tired of it tying up his money. It's a very reasonable asking price and there's always the option of writing up a loan contract. I think it's realistic, I also think you're probably underestimating your potential value. You'd make a killing if you got out and took some contracts of your own."

"I can see your point," Chris conceded. "I haven't even had a chance to try my hand at that yet. So, who owned the place and what did they use it for?"

"Well you see... Hmm. I guess I'll just come out and say it. He's a dwarf, okay." Stephan seemed worried about Chris' reaction. "I know you guys haven't had the best track record in the past, what with them stealing your treasure and you guys eating them. He's actually a good guy and a crafting genius. Armour, weapons, jewellery, trinkets, gadgets, you name it. Bit of a hoarder though, hence the warehouse. I wouldn't have wanted to see inside the place before he moved out."

Chris felt his dragon perk up at the mention of a dwarf. Interesting. There was an instinctual reaction of wariness there but it wasn't overpowering.

"I don't know much of anything about dwarves," Chris replied. "I've certainly never met one or been wronged by one. I'd be happy to put aside any prejudices if he feels the same way. Tell him I can pay at least partially in dragon gold."

"Dragon gold?" Stephan's smile couldn't be contained. "A stroke of brilliance, Chris. He'll bend over backwards to get his mitts on a bit of dragon gold. I didn't know you had any, but I suppose that sort of information is best kept close to the chest."

"Yeah, I'm sort of an amateur prospector. At least I used to be back before all this happened. When you contact him, I've got a few conditions. Reyla is worried about dragon gold getting back into the market, I wouldn't be okay with him selling it off. I'd want him to use it himself."

"I'm sure we can come up with a solution, Chris. Does this mean you want to move forward?" Stephan asked.

"I like it, the industrial look is pretty neat actually. What's your professional opinion, Stephan? Is it sound? What about the geology report, is it what we're looking for?"

"It's green lights across the board from me, Chris. You'll never regret picking up the warehouse at the same time, these sorts of things have a way of coming in handy, even if it's just to start a car collection. There's plenty of work to do but that's the fun part!"

"Lillian, Oslo? What do you think? Is it a good spot, the neighbourhood okay?" Chris looked towards his protectors for some experienced opinions.

"I don't see any issues," Lillian commented. "It's still reasonable to walk back to the Compound and Being district. The place will be easy enough to secure, especially once you go underground. Of course, Susan will enjoy living so close to her work."

"She's working nearby?" Chris hadn't been to her new workplace yet.

"Yes, it's one block over," the vampire replied.

"Well that's a bonus. Oslo?"

"If it's what you want, Chris. Go for it. Stephan will see you right." The gruff bodyguard was happy to have provided the introduction leading up to this point.

"Thank you, Oslo, I appreciate it. You too Stephan, I can't wait. Alright, let's do this!" The young man's enthusiasm was infectious and the others smiled as well, feeling involved and appreciated in one way or another.

"Great, Chris. With any luck, I'll have a contract for you to review within a week. In the meantime, I'll buckle down on drawing up some designs," Stephan was already planning out the tasks before him with bull-headed focus.

***

Michelle was waiting for him when they got back to the hotel. Laid out on the dining room table around her were several important looking documents, little 'sign here' tabs sticking out all over the place.

She looked tired, her short black hair a bit ruffled and a darkness to the olive-toned skin beneath those piercing eyes of hers. Nevertheless, she perked up as Chris strode over to the kitchen, greeting first Annabel, then Susan with brief kisses.

When he turned back to her, eyes intent, her heart nearly leapt out of her chest. She was about to receive the same treatment! Her body tensed in both anticipation and nervousness as he approached, towering over her.

"What's wrong, Michelle? You look... well you look like you've had a bad day," he asked, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder.

"Oh, it's fine, Chris. It was tiring but I got a lot done. See? I have your employment agreement as well as a bunch of other bureaucratic shit for you to look at," Michelle relaxed, he was just being his friendly protective self. She was his familiar after all and she was coming to accept his friendly affection as well as all the magical happenings.

"Not before I get my kiss!" Petra growled from concealment in the living room. "I feel like I'm being left out."

"Me too," came Claire's ever jovial voice.

"Me! Me! Me first!" Immianthe flashed out of his bedroom, practically colliding with his face.

"Okay, okay," Chris laughed.

He scooped the naked sprite into his hand and brought her to eye level.

"Hello, Master," She purred, posing her sinful little body ever so provocatively, legs crossed and leaning back to thrust her proportional but still very impressive chest towards him.

"Hello, my little blue bundle of mischief. How are you?" he smiled, bringing her closer.

"I'm happy to see you! May I have my kiss?"

"Of course," Chris leaned in, bringing his lips in range for her to lean forward and give him a little peck. It wasn't the most practical thing, they both knew it, but he indulged her anyway. A shuffle of movement later, he felt a small pair of breasts shoved against his lips. He smiled around her perfect little tits before giving them a swipe with his tongue, covering them entirely.

"Master! Don't stop," she murmured.

"I'm sorry little one, you wanted to go first which means we have to be quick," He gave her a parting lick before blowing gently across her wet blue skin.

"No fair," she complained as he set her down on the table next to Michelle.

As he peaked into the living room, he found a rather interesting sight. Mother and daughter dragonesses were spooned on one of the rich leather couches. Even the thought of the two sultry creatures entwined so intimately made his mind come up with all sorts of depraved ideas.

Petra, as the larger spoon, had her back to the couch and her hand resting lovingly over her daughter's flat torso where the tiny life blossomed. Their rich platinum and auburn hair flowed freely on the pillow they'd commandeered from his bedroom, intermingling like the waters of two great rivers.

They looked up at him in unison and beamed lazy happiness his way like the reptiles they were. They were both wearing grey yoga pants which did nothing to disguise their exquisite figures and... were those his t-shirts?

Petra beckoned him over, showing no intention of moving whatsoever. He knelt in front of them, placing a hand on Claire's athletic waist and rubbing softly with his thumb on her tummy, displacing Petra's hand.

"Doesn't he just look good enough to gobble up?" the stunning mother murmured?

"Mmmh, I'd certainly swallow whatever I could get," Claire grinned evilly.

"Me too, we're feeling very neglected, Sire," Petra pouted and Chris quickly found himself on the receiving end of both dragoness' imploring green-eyed gaze.

Chris swallowed, apprehensively.

"Yeah Mom, it was so wonderful when he mated and bred me but he's barely even touched me since," Claire laid it on even thicker.

Something in Chris' jeans twitched as he looked down at them helplessly. Neither of the women missed it.

"I know. It's okay, my beautiful daughter, we'll find a way through this together."

Petra gently raised her head and Claire turned in beautiful synchronisation to meet her. Their soft, moist lips barely touched while their eyes never left the true target of their lust, the man looming over them.

"Oh fuck me," a whisper escaped Chris' mouth.

"With pleasure," Petra smirked. "But it seems you aren't interested in us now that you've done your duty and planted your seed within us."

"It's not that, I swear," he backpedalled.

"No? Then what? We have needs my beloved mate. Especially now that we're pregnant. Once our nesting instinct truly begins, we're going to need a lot of attention," Petra watched as her words coaxed his large member to expand down his leg, straining for room to grow. It must have been uncomfortable.

"I'm sorry, ladies. It's just been busy and then after, well, you know... I wasn't sure if you would want to. Annabel had some trouble."

"Chris, I will always want to. Okay?" Claire smiled.

Petra could no longer resist reaching out to grasp the erection that was driving her crazy. Her mate's wonderfully arousing scent was tickling her nose as she looked directly into his eyes and gently massaged his thickening cock through the denim. Air hissed from his lungs and his eyelids fluttered in response.

"Yes, don't forget that we aren't human, Sire. We would love to relieve some of the pressure your First's punishment is building up. Why the girl would ever want to deny you pleasure is unfathomable," Petra's eyes were alight with pure lust as she continued rubbing him.

Suddenly, Chris let out a groan as his still growing member became quite painful in its fabric prison. He gently pushed Petra's hand away and readjusted himself as best he could, sorely tempted to let the monster free but knowing exactly where that would lead.

"I'm sorry my beautiful mates. Whilst very tempted, I feel my punishment is deserved so I am going to respect Annabel's authority on this. However, as soon as the ban is lifted, you have my word that I will shower you in as much attention as you can handle."

Chris' bold words were a poor consolation to the pair, who'd worked themselves up too with their little teasing performance.

"Damn," Claire muttered. "I was sure that would work."

"I'm impressed by your fortitude, Chris. I can only hope you bring the same strength and iron will to the bedroom," Petra was positively squirming with arousal at being denied by him. She didn't know why but she loved it.

"I'm looking forward to it, Petra. Now, I came over here to deliver some kisses."

Finally, he extracted himself from the dangerous duo. They'd thoroughly tried convincing him nonverbally for several minutes. In the bathroom he took in his flushed appearance, unzipped himself, and sat on the edge of the bathtub for several minutes to calm down.

After peeing, washing up, and checking he was once again decent, he went back the dining room and sat down with Michelle and Lillian.

The statuesque vampire was in plain sight again and reading through the documents Michelle had prepared for Chris.

"You survived, I see," Lillian teased him, watching the flush spread back across his cheeks.

"Barely," he replied. "So, what am I signing? I'm glad you're having a look, Lillian, I appreciate it. Are you okay with me taking on this role with Michelle and working for the humans?"

"You didn't have a choice in the matter," the vampire replied, not looking up from the contracts. "Michelle has worked the situation as favourably as can be expected, you are escaping the Synod's jurisdiction and instead contracting yourself to serve the humans. Being paid to escape punishment seems like an equitable deal to me."

"Lillian, I meant are you okay with it? I'd hoped you would come with me," He asked tentatively.

This time she looked up, locking his eyes in an appraising gaze. The edge of her mouth twitched into her trademark almost-too-wide smile.

"I won't be letting you out of my sight, until you're ready, dragon. I can hardly trust your safety to these humans, however skilled they may be. Besides, this will serve as an opportunity to continue our training beyond hand to hand combat," She replied. "Having said that, I cannot babysit you forever. There are ever more demands for my time these days. I'll need to wean you from my day to day schedule and start accompanying you only when it's prudent."

"You'll also be receiving training from us, weapons, basic field and intelligence tradecraft," Michelle offered. "We don't want to put you in situations where you need to use it unless absolutely necessary, but you need to have it to understand what we do. Besides, we only want you using magic as a last resort or in situations where you won't be observed doing so, at least until the Revelation."

"What about afterwards? How long am I contracted to the government for?" Chris asked suspiciously.

"This contract is for one year, with the option to renew for a further two, if they want to. After that you're a free man again," Michelle explained.

Chris frowned at the mention of three years without the option to get out of it.

"At a salary of $180,000 a year, plus travel, every sort of insurance under the sun, and diplomatic privileges you're not being hard done by, Chris. Especially as you're only required to show up three days a week," She couldn't help a smile at his look of shock when she mentioned the figure

"$180,000! Fuck me. Why didn't you lead with that, Michelle?" Growing up, he'd never dreamed of earning such a salary.

"That figure is almost insultingly low," Lillian drawled. "About as low as could be considered legitimate, I suspect."

"Really?" Chris looked to the vampire in wonder.

"Considering your capabilities and uniqueness, yes," She said. "There are humans who earn far more by doing far less than you're about to.

"I hadn't thought about it that way," Chris mused. "You have to admit, it's a pretty good start for a kid straight out of high school though!"

Lillian nodded, accepting his point.

"It's true that the offer isn't as high as you might receive for similar services after the Revelation, it is very fair for what you'll be doing. Not to mention the training and influence you'll accrue if we play our cards right, you can't easily put a dollar figure on that," Michelle explained.

"I understand, Michelle. I'm still thinking like a 19-year-old and it's easy to see the money as the important part. I'm going to be relying on you to guide me through this to our best advantage," He said, laying a large hand on top of one of hers in thanks.

"Of course, Chris, you can count on me. This is part of my master plan after all. My career will be carried higher and higher by association with you. I'm going to ride you all the way to the top!" Michelle said enthusiastically, excited by the prospect of working with Chris to push positive outcomes for both beings and humans in the troubling times they were facing.

"Really?" Lillian arched an eyebrow. "You're going to ride him..."

Michelle blushed wonderfully when she realised her phrasing was questionable at best.

"That's not...I didn't..." she was mortified.

"Well I suppose you won't be the only one," the vampire continued. "There will be plenty of jockeying for position on the poll."

"God, Lillian, you're terrible," Chris groaned before a grin transformed his face. "I love it."

"I try," the vampire smiled back.

"Don't let Lillian see you react like that," Annabel brushed a friendly hand across Michelle's shoulder as she walked around the table towards Chris. "She'll never let up once she knows your buttons."

Chris knew what she wanted as he watched Annabel approach from the kitchen, apron clinging tightly to her jean-clad hips. He pushed his chair backwards, preparing his lap for her and made a little giddy-up motion with a hand. She smiled indulgently, turned, and deposited herself unceremoniously.

"Hello, beautiful," he whispered into her soft hair, scenting her and wrapping his arms around her waist.

"Hi," She looked up and gave him the lightest of kisses, barely brushing her lips against his own before burying her face against his shoulder and doing some scenting of her own. His rich, cinnamon-like musk was as delightful and comforting as ever, setting her senses alight and a warmth into her core. "I thought I might come and help you look through all these documents while I'm waiting for dinner to finish. It's all in the oven now so in about fifty minutes, we should have a delicious chicken roast ready to satisfy that never-ending hunger of yours. I'm even cooking two birds this time."

"You're the best, Dee. I have been eating a lot lately, haven't I?" Chris squeezed her closer in appreciation.

"Well you have grown substantially and from what you've told me, been working hard on your training," Michelle suggested, happy that the slender brunette's arrival had distracted from her embarrassment. It was very unlike her to be flustered like that. She'd been working for years in what was a male dominated profession and thought she could give and take a bit of banter quite well. When it came to Chris, though, any suggestion of innuendo was all too real.

"It's to be expected," Lillian agreed. "I don't think Annabel will need to look for a job, it's going to be full time looking after this great oaf's appetite."

"It's all calculated, ladies," Annabel said in a conspiratorial tone. "If my mother taught me any valuable life lessons it's that men are simple creatures, feed them well and they'll keep coming back for more."

"Suits me!" Chris chortled, giving the exposed part of her bottom a cheeky, gentle pinch in retaliation.

Annabel grabbed the offending hand and guided it to her tummy, where she held him until he began a soft petting motion.

"Truer words were never spoken," Lillian smiled, watching their unconsciously open affection before increasing her grin deep into the ominous. This time her fangs were exposed. "The same also applies to Vampires though so be careful how you apply the theory."

--------------------------------------------
Annabel couldn't help but swallow nervously in response to the predatory look the vampire sent her way. Even after several weeks of getting used to Lillian's antics, it was hard not to react instinctively.

"See, Michelle? She's still trying to push my buttons. I think she likes seeing us lowly humans squirm. She imagines how it would feel sinking those wicked fangs of hers deep into our soft, defenceless skin. Feeling that thick, hot blood splash across her tongue, mmmhhh," Annabel finished off with a small moan of passion, looking directly into Lillian's smouldering eyes.

Chris gripped Annabel firmly in warning but it wasn't needed. Her demeanour changed to in impish smile mere seconds later, leaving no doubt that she'd just been teasing the vampire right back.

Nostrils flaring, Lillian exhaled a long, calming breath and shook her head to dislodge the teenager's seductive words. It was fun to have the girl challenge her right back, however unwise it was to tease a vampire. It once again showed a level of trust she knew she didn't deserve. "You play a very dangerous game young lady, but you play it well."

"I try," Annabel parroted the vampire's earlier words, even adding a hint of Lillian's own faint Russian accent.

Chris laughed openly while Michelle's giggle slipped out despite her best efforts to contain it behind her hand.

"Dah, I will give you that one," Lillian joined in the laughter.

After that, they settled down and got into to the task of reviewing the finer details of the documents spread out on the table. There was a lot of reading to be done and while Michelle knew there weren't any unusual legal pitfalls hidden away in the fine print, it was nonetheless important for Chris to read and understand what he was signing up for.

They took a break to eat dinner, clearing the table to make room for Annabel's delicious efforts. Chris and Susan knew what Annabel was capable of in the kitchen so it came as no surprise that the chicken was wonderfully moist, tender, and flavourful. The others showered her with effusive praise and asked how exactly she'd seasoned the meal so spectacularly.

After dinner, they resumed reading through Chris's contract. Hours later, he was satisfied that he'd gotten through the various documents with enough thoroughness and understanding to be happy to sign them. It was great to have Lillian and Michelle there to clarify certain sections when the legal jargon began making it difficult for him to interoperate confidently.

The signing took forever too, with him having to initial every page and sign and date multiple different documents in various places.

Overall, he thought he was getting a pretty good deal. Revealing himself unintentionally to the military and being fired upon by an extremely expensive missile/satellite interception system was a pretty big deal it turns out. With Michelle's manoeuvring, he'd gotten a high paying job instead of being brought before the Synod for his rather reckless behaviour. That was doubly important seeing as he'd recently earned the scorn of several powerful members.

Michelle's assurance that he'd be working with her to help the government prepare for the Revelation made him feel positive about the situation, rather than that it was being forced upon him. He still wasn't 100% comfortable with her plans to put him in the public spotlight but he was beginning to see her reasoning and understand the potential this position could offer him if he wanted to grasp it.

Eventually it was over and Annabel promptly dragged him off to bed, wanting a snuggle buddy even if her body was still off limits to his depredations.

It took an annoyingly long time to get to sleep. A naked, soft Annabel pressed up against him would usually guarantee a tiring, satisfying encounter to help him drift off. This punishment of hers was becoming unbearable.

His erection throbbed angrily between them. It had been days and he was so God-damn horny that he was about to lose this challenge he'd set himself.

The thought of sneaking quietly into Susan's room and ravishing her over and over to the sound of her delighted wailing had him reaching to pull back the covers more than once. What held him back was a sinking fear that with his new, enlarged form, he would have just as much if not more trouble having sex with her as he had with Annabel.

He decided to talk with Annabel tomorrow, his beast-like libido was getting out of hand and he needed some relief. Even if it was a little self-gratification, anything would be better than this wound-up, throbbing state.

***

Annabel awoke in the darkness. Fleeting images of her dream still rattling around inside her skull. Her lover's huge, hybrid dragon form looming over her, dwarfing her, inside her. He'd been savage, taking her roughly in punishment for denying him her body. He'd growled, nipped, kissed, licked and manhandled in all the right ways; his huge purple and creamy-white body pinned her to some sort of rich, animal fur rug.

She'd loved every second of dream-sex. Screamed in joy as he'd thrust that hot, large cock of his deep into her core. It must have been a dream because it hadn't hurt much at all and had taken her to the brink of orgasm in just a few masterful thrusts.

An incessant sensation at her nipple brought her further out of sleep, realising that the peculiar pinching must have been what woke her.

Quietly reaching for the bedside lamp in an attempt not to wake Chris, she flicked the switch. The covers were pulled back a little to find a very guilty looking cartoon dragon staring up at her from his perch on one of her small breasts, a delicate teat throbbing from his excited gnawing.

"Naughty," She scolded him sleepily, her head thumping back into the pillow, trying to recapture more of that fleeting dream.

A hand traipsed down across her smooth tummy. It rested there in the short brown curls, a trimmed little triangle above her sex. It was all that was left after yesterday's grooming. She paused there, wondering if she wanted to take it any further. It had been a while since she'd masturbated. She and Chris had been making love so regularly. Until recently that is. She missed the sex, a lot.

Curiosity of what his enchantment might be doing to her was ultimately the excuse she used to slip her fingers down further, exploring her vulva and coming to terms with some of the changes she'd noticed a few days ago.

For starters, she was drenched. It was hardly a surprise after awakening from such a dream. But the quality of her moisture was different somehow. There was definitely more than she was used to, not that she'd had any problems with inadequate lubrication to date mind you. It felt different. Slicker somehow and thicker too, adhering to her fingers and enflamed labia and oozing reluctantly from her slit. It also had been leaving much more prominent residues in her underwear, which had been her first warning sign that something had changed down there.

Speaking of her labia, she ghosted the slick, plump flesh, running her fingers up and down along their engorged contours. They parted almost reluctantly under a little force, sending a spark of pleasure up her spine.

Both pairs of labia were larger now. She'd been happy with how she was put together downstairs beforehand but now her outer lips were extremely full. She'd even go so far as to call them fat. Her inner pair, previously barely visible unless she opened her legs now pouted defiantly up and down the length of her slit. They didn't look out of place or anything, all frilly and pink, but when she'd first gotten a look in the mirror it had taken some getting used to.

Her clitoris peaked tentative from between those lush folds of flesh, slightly more prominent than she remembered, excited and ready for action. A little bean in need of some serious flicking. She didn't have to dip her fingers inside to gather moisture, they were already covered as her hand naturally gravitated towards that joyful bundle of nerves.

She gasped at first contact, shooting a guilty look towards Chris. He was still asleep on his back so she began a gentle circular motion, teasing herself.

Her eyes closed in pleasure and her vagina shuddered appreciatively, seeking to squeeze and coax but finding nothing there to embrace. Gods, she needed him. When her eyes opened, they again gravitated to her sleeping lover, and then down the large, blanket-covered contour she could see in the soft light.

He was right there. All she had to do was roll over into him and demand some mind-blowing sex. It would be so easy. Her eyes rested on the tent he was making at his groin. That monster was already rearing to get into the action.

The changes she'd been observing over the previous days eased her apprehension at tackling his new, absurd size. One of the first things she'd thought whilst looking at herself in the mirror was that her pussy looked like it built to handle a good dicking. His stupid enchantment was actually doing what he'd wanted it to. Annabel realised that she didn't want to wait a second longer to test the results.

Bartholomew raced excitedly around her belly button as she made that resolution. She couldn't help the tiny giggle that escaped her at his antics, the poor tattoo had been sulking all week after she'd deprived him of his main source of sustenance.

She was hungry too though. Hungry for him. Hungry for his smell, his taste. She wanted to his sticky, magic-bound seed erupting forcefully inside her, coating her insides one molten squirt after another. She ached for that delightful tingling and heavy-body satisfaction that left her nigh insensate afterwards.

Enough!

Annabel grasped the covers and slowly peeled them away from their naked bodies.

***

Chris awoke to a strange dichotomy of warmth and coolness. At first, he thought he must have managed to wrestle the covers off himself.

The incessant, hot, lapping his engorged cockhead was receiving quickly brought him wide awake in the light of the bedside lamp.

Looking down, Annabel's eyes twinkled up at him delightfully. Her lips were spread wide, engulfing his enflamed crown, her tongue teasing the sensitive underside. He groaned as she acknowledged him by applying a staggering amount of suction and increasing the grip her hand had on his thick root.

"Oh yes," he murmured sleepily.

She flicked her tongue, attempting to burrow it into the little slit at the very tip of the prodigious member before slowly removing him from her mouth with an audible slurp.

Streams of viscous, warm saliva cascaded down his length, only to be caught up and spread all over his shaft by her hand as she began a firm jerking motion. Her other hand gathered her long, wild hair out of the way and down across her left shoulder. She let out a lustful moan before she spoke, her lips retreating only millimetres from the angry, hot manhood.

"Mmm...I'm so worked up, Chris. God, I should have known I couldn't hold out for long. It's not fair."

"What's not fair?" He asked, gritting his teeth and flexing his cock in an attempt to stave off the mounting pleasure. He was seriously on a hair trigger right now after days of forced abstinence. A little streamer of runny pre-come spurted across her waiting lips as his cock jumped.

She didn't miss a beat, her pink tongue snaked out to collect the delicious morsel before she replied.

"You shouldn't smell and taste so good, you shouldn't use pheromones and magic to ensnare a poor, innocent girl like me," She paused, pursing her plump lips around his tip and attempting to suck more of his fluid directly from him. "And you definitely shouldn't have such a fucking huge cock!"

"That's no way for a poor, innocent girl to talk," Chris chuckled. "And this certainly isn't how one would behave either."

He reached down and cupped her jaw, running a thumb across those sinful lips of hers.

"What can I say, you're awakening my nasty side," She smiled as her hand kept jacking up and down in a vain attempt to encircle his girth. Her other slid off his muscular thigh to gently cradle and heft his large pair of testicles. She just knew were jam-packed with his hot, potent seed. She craved it. They too over-spilled her grasp, just like the fucking flag pole she was still wrangling in her other hand.

"Nasty Annabel can come out and play whenever she likes," he groaned as she gently fondled him.

"Look at these things! Jesus Chris, I think we'd better let off some pressure before you fuck me."

His eyes widened in lust and astonishment.

"You heard me," she continued, running her tongue down the underside of his shaft to accentuate her point. Opening wide, she barely managed to inhale one of his large, tender balls partially into her mouth. She sucked, pulling back gently until the orb was forced to pop back out, half of it glistening lewdly. His spicy musk was so thick down there, driving her arousal and anticipation higher still.

"I want you to cum, Chris. I want to taste it. I want to see you shooting across my tongue and then I want you to roll me over and fuck me, Chris. Can you do that for me?"

"What about..." he didn't get a chance to finish his sentence.

"Shh," she hushed him. "I know what you're going to say but I can't stand it anymore, Babe. I need you. We're going to have to try sooner or later, I think I'm ready."

She swayed her naked hips back and forth, giving him a wonderful profile of her perfect ass and narrow waist, all the while her hands continued their loving manipulation.

"Okay, Dee," Chris was eager and hopeful to discover what his enchantment had done to her yet reserved about getting his hopes too high. Above all, he had to avoid hurting her.

"Yee of little faith," Annabel recognised the doubt in his eyes. "Now, shut up and let me get back to work."

She smiled mischievously before tugging his resisting cock downwards, straining against the upwards force of his blood-engorged shaft, making him gasp at the pleasurable strain. While he was distracted, she slipped his fat, pulsing head into her mouth again and got down to the basics of coaxing out his fast approaching orgasm.

It was painfully obvious that he wasn't going to last. Chris couldn't help it as his dick hardened in preparation for the release he'd been waiting for all week. Her mouth was so warm and her lips stroked delightfully against the very sensitive edge of his cockhead, sending pleasure washing over his body. Moments later, she abandoned his testicles and brought both hands to work on his steel-hard shaft. They shucked sloppily up and down his length in unison as she purposefully expelled more spittle from her sucking mouth.

Perhaps best of all, her eyes twinkled in delight as he tried vainly to stave off an embarrassingly quick release. She wanted him to come, wanted him to lose any semblance of control. His dragon instinct purred, releasing his resistance to give the saucy little minx exactly what she wanted.

Chris' throat began a drawn-out groan of absolute pleasure as he finally peaked. His hips flexed up, abdomen tensing as his huge cock throbbed harder still. His eyes squeezed shut, unable to do anything but be carried away in the pleasure of her warm, moist caresses.

Pre-come flooded up his shaft, coating Annabel's tongue and drawing out a muffled moan as she finally felt his thick length reach an undeniable rigidity, swelling larger in her already stuffed mouth. She felt the first contraction rocket up the mighty beast and braced to receive it. It was a good thing she had, for the thick streamer of dragon-cum blasted straight to the back of her mouth, almost overwhelming her.

She didn't have time to try swallowing his unnaturally thick, sticky spend before a second titanic throb heralded the forceful arrival of the next molten spurt. Then she was lost, his taste and potent magical essence forced itself upon her very being. Her mind was reduced to a gently firing mass of pleasure neurons. A whimper welled up inside her throat as she was overwhelmed, her eyes losing focus and eventually shutting tight as her whole body quivered, magic zinging between her cells. All the while, she felt him splash hot against her tongue and teeth, quickly filling her already occupied mouth.

Chris opened bleary eyes as his orgasm continued unabated, his cock throbbing repeatedly as pulse after pulse of semen raced up his shaft. He watched Annabel falter, overtaken by her own pleasure and felt her begin a vain attempt to swallow it all down.

Cum quickly leaked around her mouth, dribbling down his shaft as she gulped to keep up. But it was too much. With a high-pitched whine of satisfaction, her lips released the swollen, spitting head. Still he wasn't done, a thick rope of his seed spewed forth. Up across her lips and face, arching high into the air to splatter down in her silky chestnut hair. Another followed as his cock twitched, firing high up across his belly and chest.

Annabel opened her eyes cautiously and watched in wonder, regaining some control over her body as the initial intensity of her orgasm dulled to a low rumble. Now she finally had a chance to swallow down the spicy, salty cum inundating her mouth. She giggled insanely as the godlike phallus refused to stop. She was absolutely plastered with the thick white ribbons and loving the messy debauchery. Perhaps Immi was rubbing off on her.

She stuck out her tongue and angled him down until the thick, angry head found a purpose-built resting place against the dexterous pink tissue. She squealed excitedly as she received another hot splatter across her cheek for her troubles. When she felt safe she wasn't going to get a blast in her eye, she looked up at his stupid, orgasm-scrunched face and watched his astonishment as she finally jacked the last few dribbles across her pink tongue to lovingly pool in her mouth.

Chris' chest heaved, remembering to breathe as his orgasm finally gave out. His cock throbbed maddeningly, pulsing as if it never wanted to stop spewing his load over the gorgeous body of the slim teen. He tingled sensitively but she seemed to apply just the right amount of stimulation with her tongue to guide him down gently from the lofty heights of pleasure he'd been soaring.

He watched in awe as she began the lengthy process of tracking down his errant streaks of semen. She was a beautiful mess. Several lines tracked up across her cheeks, more clung in the mass of smooth, brown hair. Her swollen lips were covered, but quickly being swiped clean by that sinful tongue of hers.

More still glistened across her chin, on the naked skin of her slender shoulder, and up onto his chest. It was unbelievable that it had all been inside him a few shuddering breaths earlier. He even watched Bartholomew streak across her glazed skin, leaving no trace of the gleaming fluid behind as the greedy enchantment gobbled up what he could before his mistress had it for herself.

Annabel watched him stare, knowing he must be getting some serious man-fantasy satisfaction. She was going to play the fuck out of this.

She'd known after that fateful experience in the shower that he was going to cum like a prize bull. She shivered in satisfaction knowing that she, just a regular girl, had this powerful dragon in her thrall, that he loved her with all his heart. It didn't seem possible.

"I can't tell you how good that was, Dee," He finally panted down at her.

"Mmmhhh... It was my pleasure," She let out an extravagant purr, still working to clean his slightly softening erection. "You know I love sucking you off, Chris. Look at it all though, no wonder Claire and Petra are pregnant."

He looked away briefly, squeamish at the mention of the two dragonesses.

"What's wrong, Chris? I'm not allowed to mention that in the bedroom, how you knocked up two beautiful dragonesses?" She smiled coquettishly up at him. The dichotomy between the dominant, confident dragon and the sensitive young man was fun to play with and despite his apparent embarrassment, she could feel the massive shaft twitch as she stroked his ego.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 12|
--------------------------------------------
"The flattery seems a bit over the top, but I guess that's part of your plan, isn't it?" It was a new side he was seeing of Annabel, still he was beginning to switch on to her teasing. The key was to just go with it.

"Not as over the top as this cock of yours, you cum like a stallion, Chris. Jesus, if you ever get bored with magic your backup plan could be to move to L.A. and take the porn industry by storm!" Annabel chuckled, running her hands down his powerful legs as she finally sat up. She was satisfied that she'd collected what she could of his seed.

"Hah! If I did, I'd drag you along with me," Chris teased back. "I don't know what's gotten into you that you're suddenly such a confident little minx but I can definitely imagine you in front of a camera."

His eyes devoured her porcelain, almost coltish body. He loved those little tits of hers and the way her waist flared into that superb ass, there was nothing coltish about that ass. His cock twitched, eager once again at the sight of her. He couldn't see her snatch and he was dying to find out what exactly his magic had accomplished. All she'd done so far was hint.

"I'm only like this for you, Chris," Her eyes were serious for a moment before she cocked her head mockingly. "I'm not sure what's gotten into me but I can tell you what hasn't!"

She reached out to stroke a single finger all the way from his root to his tip, making his entire body shudder.

In a great surge he leaned up off the bed, abruptly bringing them face to face. She squeaked as one of his hands hand fell harshly on her ass, the slap of flesh resounding around the bedroom. She froze as his other hand encircled her and began working soothingly up either side of her spine, all the way to the base of her neck. His nose nudged against her ear and into her hair. She relaxed, teasing accomplished, the dragon had awoken.

Feeling her posture soften, Chris pulled away to consider the beautiful depths of her mischievous doe-like eyes. Muscles surged with power as his mind opened fully to the dragon's instinctual thoughts. For a moment, his body quivered with the desire to change form but such feelings were becoming easier to control now.

He leaned forward, kissing her gently to begin with, trying to convey his thanks and love for her. He could taste himself in her mouth as she enthusiastically returned his kiss, her nimble tongue darting out to tease his own. Their passion rose higher and the exchange became anything but gentle. She made the cutest little murmuring noises into his mouth as he kneaded her smarting rump, easing the sting and the big red handprint he'd left her for her teasing.

His sensitive nose finally began awakening to her pungent arousal, forcing him to end the kiss out of eagerness to move his mouth downwards to the source that tantalising scent. God, he loved this woman.

He growled into her pursed lips before flipping them back onto the sheets, coming to rest directly on top of her.

Annabel giggled happily as his large body overshadowed her. She wasn't a short girl at 5'8'' but his massive bulk dwarfed her completely, his broad chest hovering carefully above her, powerful thighs spreading her own legs open as he settled onto her. Their skin touched, sending a shiver of excitement across her high-strung body. Her stiff little teats brushed his chest, sensitive. Finally, his cock settled on her tummy, hot and heavy while his virile testicles flopped against the lush flesh of her swollen little cunny.

She sighed contentedly at the whole-body contact, looking up again into those in intense blue eyes. Then he was kissing her again.

Annabel couldn't help squirming, seeking friction and sensation against him in any form. She could feel the intoxicating effect of his pheromones working her lust higher with every second he wasn't inside of her. She wanted more, to be absolutely consumed with lust, to feel his fangs sink into her. It was delicious yet unbearable, causing her to finally push against his heavy weight and break their kiss, panting.

No words needed to be spoken as her fingernails raked gently across his skin, her soft eyes pleading. He knew exactly what for. But before he moved down her body, he gently wormed a hand underneath her shoulder, lifting her. She gave him an inquisitive look as he collected pillows with his other hand from around the dishevelled bed, propping them behind her in a big pile, protecting her from the headboard.

He cupped her delicate jaw one last time as he began smooching his way from behind her ear. Down he trailed torturously, tasting the soft, sensitive skin of her neck, her small but oh-so-well-formed breasts.

Chris couldn't help but linger for a few moments, lavishing those little tits of hers with all the attention such cute assets deserved. Each breast could almost be inhaled entirely, bathing the pale skin with warm saliva and lashing the tiny sensitive peaks until Annabel was forced to grip his short blond hair and push him down where he was really needed.

She couldn't help snickering at the almost reproachful look he shot up at her, like she'd just thrown his favourite toy in the garbage or something. His honest appreciation of her breasts would ever endear him to her.

Her hand didn't let up with its downwards pressure, forcing him to shuffle backwards on the bed. He felt the wispy tickle of her pubic hair on his chin as her scent grew overpowering. Still, he didn't break eye contact until she finally released her authoritative grip, moving instead to stroke across his scalp encouragingly.

There was an anxious look on her face. He moved his hands to gently stroke the outside of her wide-spread thighs encouragingly before finally glancing down at his prize.

Ripe. She was obviously ready for him, glistening in the soft light. Chris could finally see what she'd been teasing, what his spell had done to her most intimate area. Any guilt or apprehension he'd been holding evaporated, his dragon spreading an excited sense of vindication inside him as he stared.

"Chris?" Annabel asked.

He looked up, seeing the look of impatience on her face. He smiled wolfishly, kissing her inner thigh.

"Beautiful as always," He replied.

"Well don't just stare at it. Get to work!" She huffed, her fingers once again flexing dangerously in his hair.

"As you wish," he smiled roguishly.

He wasted no time, placing his tongue flat across as much of her swollen pussy as it would cover, holding it still momentarily, collecting her familiar taste before flicking quickly up across her engorged clit.

"Fuck!" Annabel groaned in response, her hips bucking upwards, seeking more stimulation.

He skilfully avoided her little nubbin for the next few minutes, exploring her labia with a languid enthusiasm that drove her absolutely crazy. Chris couldn't get enough of her natural taste and scent, mixed with the perfume of whatever vanilla based product she favoured for hygiene.

There were certainly plenty of her juices to lap up. As he kissed, licked, and even gently gummed her plush labia, it oozed copiously from her slit. As her cries of pleasure mounted, he finally noticed the subtle change of the consistency her lubrication. It seemed thicker and stickier, like he associated with Susan. Interesting that his enchantment had changed her so.

His tongue had instantly fallen in love with her enlarged inner lips, playing the soft, frilly tissue as his hands slid up to grip her behind the knees, spreading her wider. He moved back for a moment to look at her laid open, the deep pink, glistening tissues of her vagina just visible between the wet slit of her cunt. Damn she was swollen. She must be really worked up.

He lunged back in, determined to bring her relief but not before a little healthy teasing. His tongue quickly bulled its way into her tight opening, sinking deep into her hot channel, his nose grinding into her clitoris.

Annabel screamed, her body shuddering as he finally gave her some heavy stimulation, using his dexterous tongue to bathe her sensitive inner tissues while his nose mashed her happy little clit from side to side like some ungodly bulldozer. Her thighs tried to close automatically against the intensity of her rising climax. He held firm under her knees, pushing her legs even wider in punishment for her squirming.

He didn't let up as her breath left her throat in a tortured moan, abdomen tensing, her legs kicking ineffectively against his inhuman strength. As if to drive home his control of her, he held her there, right on the brink, backing off so she couldn't quite crest that beautiful wave.

"Chris! Ahhhh... F...Fuck you! Make me cum you bastard!" Annabel shrieked, opening her eyes to glare down at him and taking a savage grip of his hair, shoving him back down into her bucking hips.

He chuckled into her slick pussy, abandoning her gushing opening and latching onto her hypersensitive clit for the death blow. He trapped the firm little bean between his tongue and upper lip, sucking gently and running his tongue rapidly back and forth. It never failed and her body soon bucked uncontrollably, sweet profanities gushing from her mouth as her fluids began escaping her quivering pussy en-masse.

He abandoned her throbbing clitoris to savour her essence, the slight saltiness, a tangy sweetness, his dragon couldn't get enough of their mate's pleasure.

Eventually Annabel relaxed, lazily wiping away the little beads of sweat forming on her forehead. She didn't know why she was sweating, he had done all the work. Her body hummed contentedly as he lapped away at her enflamed petals, collecting whatever nectar he could like some hungry bumblebee. Her entire nethers throbbed, hot, swollen, and pink-red with the extra blood flow. She felt heavy, satisfied but by no means sated.

She looked down to find him watching her salaciously from between the v of her spread legs, noticing for the first time that he had her stretched open so far that her knees almost touched her shoulders.

"Come up here, babe," she whispered, hesitant to stop his tender ministrations down below.

His entire lower face was shiny with her fluid, little milky flecks clinging to his chin but she kissed him wholeheartedly. He shuffled above her and settled his weight down once again, his cock butting against her thigh.

"That was fucking awesome, thank you," Annabel murmured, her breath still heaving her chest a little.

"So, does this mean I'm getting an official pardon for my magical tampering?" he chuckled.

"I'll consider it," She said with mock haughtiness.

"Perhaps you need some more convincing," he smiled, giving her lips a parting peck before sitting back on his haunches, looking down between them.

Annabel followed his gaze as he moved away, taking in a deep, calming breath as she saw the fearsome monster laid out on her tummy. It was hot, pulsing angrily against her skin, veins latticing below its surface, supplying blood to keep it inflated. The massive flared head was exposed from his foreskin, reaching up above her belly button in a staggering reality check. A little puddle of shiny fluid already leaked onto her from the tip. She couldn't deny it was beautiful though, and reached down to run a finger up the steel-hard length. She needed it, she had to. This was her mate, her love.

"We'll go slow," Chris watched her trace her finger up across the ridge of his cockhead. "If it hurts just say so and we'll..."

"Chris," She smiled up at him, moving to slide both hands up her thighs, gripping behind her knees and holding herself open in obvious invitation. "Shut up and fuck me."

He gave her a nervous smile, shuffling back on the bed to align himself. One hand took up position on her waist, stroking his thumb across her tummy reassuringly while the other took a grip just below his mushroom head, angling it downwards to her leaking petals.

Annabel hissed as he finally made contact, spreading her labia with small, hot nudges. She watched their juices mix. He became firmer, pushing her swollen lips this way and that, striking her clit and making her hips hunch against him in response. His head was so fat though. From her view down across her body, it looked wider than her entire mound.

Chris groaned, her heat on his tip was so good, yet such an incomplete sensation. He wanted to be buried as deep insider her as possible. Finally, he allowed himself to slot in low against her labia, forcing them to spread. He pushed in, never taking his eyes away from their joining. He had to push a little harder. It felt like her wide-spread lips were nipping at him in protest as he tested their elasticity close to the limit. He watched in astonishment as her womanhood rose to the challenge, wrapping around his thick member, strained obviously but by no means incapable of the task.

Her warmth welcomed him home, wetting him, squeezing him, melting onto him. He was inside her again.

"Fuck, Annabel, is that okay? It's so snug," He looked up, abandoning the grip on his cock to lean down and kiss her again, full of heady emotion. This woman just kept rolling with everything his screwed-up life threw at her, she was unstoppable.

Annabel cooed back into his lips, letting her thighs wrap around his waist in wordless response. Her arms snaked up his back, one into his hair and the other to grip his large bicep as he settled in on top of her. He felt fucking huge inside of her but there was no pain after that initial stretch, just a very satisfying sensation of fullness, heat, and friction against her sensitive tissues.

He was probably letting her get used to his size but she wanted more, letting him know with an impatient buck of her hips. The resulting few inches of thick dragon cock she claimed had a profoundly unexpected effect, overwhelming her with almost hypersensitive pleasure.

"Ggghhhaa..." she wailed as her muscles clamped down on the invader, her body shuddering and breath evacuating her lugs, leaving her panting.

Chris let out an animalist groan of his own as her tight pussy tried to strangle him. She'd never gripped him with such strength before. It was exquisite. His cock throbbed inside her silken depths, spewing out little streamers of pre-come in response.

"Dee, what's wrong?" He breathed as he saw her creased brow and concentrating face. He could barely resist the basic urge to force himself deeper.

She gripped his bicep fiercely and opened her eyes.

"You! You're fucking hitting my G and bumping my clit at the same time. You're so god-damn big, Chris, this is insane!"

He laughed.

"So, what would happen if I did this?" he asked, pulling back until he felt his ridge barely struggle free of her clutching grip. Without pause he jabbed forward forwards, a shallow, powerful thrust back inside her.

He began a rapid rhythm, his shaft pushing against her clitoris by virtue of how wide she was spread to accommodate him. Meanwhile the top of his buried cockhead ran repeatedly across that highly sensitive section at the roof of her little box, not far inside. Their joined sex began a lewd, moist squelching as Annabel floodgates opened to the pleasure and doused the monstrous intruder with melted love-butter.

"Fuck! Fuck.... Fuck fuck fuck ffffuuuugggaa!" Annabel screamed at him, beating her protest against his impervious backside with her heels. This was way too much stimulation, it was too intense. She tried to fight it but the added tension in her body somehow made it worse! The climax was upon her in seconds, ripping up her nerves like lightning as both her most sensitive zones were overstimulated by his plundering cock. Her body seized, insides trying to milk him. She couldn't breathe, couldn't think. It consumed her, dragged her under like a savage wave and rolled her flailing body around on the seafloor. If ever an orgasm was torture, this was it.

"Holy shit," Chris murmured, watching his handiwork play out on her shuddering, quailing body.

He had to stop, her entire body flexed. Her back arched, then her hips bucked upwards, forcing him involuntarily deeper. Her vagina once again gripped him fiercely, joining forces with her arms and legs as they struggled to hold him still. Oily juices flooded her depths, leaking out around him to dribble down her butt and onto the sheets. It wasn't her usual, smiling orgasmic mask he saw as her head shook back and forth across the pillows but a somehow pained look. Her hair was in absolute disarray as he held still and watched the climax ravage her body. Through all this, she still looked undeniably gorgeous squirming helplessly on the tip of his cock.

"Are you trying to fucking kill me?!" Annabel complained. Finally, she opened her reproachful eyes, the last shudders of pleasure still sparking through her slim body. Muscles on the verge of cramp relaxed after too long, blessed oxygen was once again circulating in her blood as her breathing restarted.

"Sorry, Dee, I thought it would be good," Chris was genuinely apologetic, a bit shocked, definitely smug.

"Too much," she groaned, her eyelids drooping again. "Overstimulated."

"We'll stop," Chris began withdrawing gently from her tender, leaking pussy.

"Don't you fucking dare!" She mumbled. "Just no more bunny-fucking."

"Bunny-fucking?" he couldn't help chuckle, kissing her sweat-beaded brow.

"Yeah, whatever you did to me. No more, I'm throbbing."

"Okay, Babe." He relented. "You did look adorable though."

"You're too big to go fast like that Chris, at least to begin with. How much do you have in me?" She asked, looking up into his azure eyes before trying to look down between their bodies.

He pushed himself up a little and they both looked down at their coupling. Unfortunately, the better part of his absurd length remained outside her. He pulled back until the ridge of his cockhead popped free, his shaft glistening with her cream, an easily visible ring of viscous white lubricant marked how far he'd penetrated. It wasn't even half way.

"Jesus," Annabel let her head flop back onto the pillows in despair. "Just put it all the way in, Chris, I need to get used to it."

"Are you sure?" he asked doubtfully.

"No, but do it anyway. Slow," She looked at him meaningfully.

He lowered himself back onto her. One elbow supported his weight while the other hooked under her thigh to angle her hips just right. He sank down with agonising restraint, using tiny thrusts. Forward and back, forward and back, it was surprisingly easy going. Perhaps easy wasn't the right word. He had to apply pressure and Annabel squirmed all the way at the sensation of such a large intruder forcing her tight quim open but there was little discomfort.

It had everything to do with how wet she was. Chris couldn't believe it, it was like her snatch was experiencing a volcanic eruption. Hot girl cum bubbled up to soak him, easing his passage ever deeper. It was incredible to feel her pulse and ripple around him, she'd developed a tantalising rhythm to her milking. Whatever his magic had done to allow her to accommodate him so well, he offered thanks into the Ether that it had worked.

Annabel huffed and puffed as he sank ever deeper. It was starting to feel really good again as the hypersensitivity of her orgasm settled down. He was fucking huge inside of her but there wasn't any real pain. She only felt soft pleasure and an addictive fullness that made her wriggle involuntarily. It was delicious; this sensation of having the dragon inside her, knowing that she could handle his size okay and provide him relief in return. Soon he would be planting his scalding seed deep in her belly again, right where it belonged. The thought made her shiver in anticipation, she'd missed that this last week.

They were both jolted from their reverie as a soft bump reverberated deep inside her, his bullish cockhead introducing itself to her cervix.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 13|
--------------------------------------------
"Sorry," he mumbled sheepishly.

"It didn't hurt," Annabel admitted.

Chris nudged into her again, testing the waters. It did feel good to rub himself gently against the gates of her womb and she had an odd look on her face that told him there was something in the sensation for her too.

"That feels strange, Chris. It used to hurt when you did it before but it's sort of good now. Are you all the way in?" Annabel asked, running an inquisitive hand down between them but suspecting that he wasn't. She could only just feel his balls ghosting her upturned rump, not pressing down hard.

They both felt her hand run across her strained labia, onto the couple inches of him remaining outside, the thick root of his improbable cock.

"Hmm. I guess that's about as much as we could have hoped for. I'm not a dragoness after all," Annabel sighed.

"I wouldn't want you to be. You're Annabel, by beautiful fiancé slash familiar," He replied, kissing the tip of her nose affectionately as she felt around their swampy coupling.

"You say the sweetest things sometimes, usually while your cock is inside me. I wonder why that is?" She teased.

"I can't help it," he smiled down and gave an experimental flex of his tool, watching her inhale sharply and her eyelids flutter. "I'm powerless against your wiles."

"Chris? Could you um... could you?" the words refused to leave her mouth and she blushed harder if that was possible, turning her head away.

"What? Dee?"

"The dragon. Do you think... could you transform? Please, Chris?"

He chuckled affectionately in that infuriating way of his, like he had all the confidence in the world and her desires and sexual hang-ups were trifling. She knew he didn't mean anything buy it though.

"Of course, Annabel," he hesitated to say what he had on his mind but went ahead anyway. "You know I'll probably get bigger, right?"

"I know. Leave it in, I want to feel it."

"Fuck you're hot," was about as eloquent a response as he could manage.

He made sure to pull his hips back a little, her caressing channel resisting him. Then he closed his eyes and reached for his dragon, effortlessly merging into their equal form. The ease of transformation after his full bonding was still new to him. He barely felt the ripple of magic that flowed down his body. His skin turned to tiny scales, his wings sprouting gloriously above him, his body enlarging slightly and hardening to godlike physique.

Annabel looked up at her dragon in awe, feeling him grow fractionally thicker inside her, hotter. Her womanhood fluttered in protest as she felt his shape slightly change too, his cockhead becoming more pointed and flared, like the tip of some great spear. Above her, his nose flattened to a little snout, his skin instantly painted a fetching royal purple, his chest a creamy white. His already giant body thrummed with inhuman strength, growing and toning before her disbelieving eyes as his wings extended in a triumphant stretch. Her dragon.

Soon, the tickle of overwhelmingly potent pheromones she'd been waiting for invaded her nostrils with a waft of cinnamon. The effect was instantaneous, lighting the smouldering embers of that desperate desire he inflicted on her in this form. This was what she needed, the heady lust, an uncontrollable instinct to be bred by this savage, primal creature.

She cried out. Hot need blossomed deep inside her core. She flexed her inner muscles against his huge manhood, hunching her hips up into him. She needed him now!

His serpentine eyes flashed open above her, purple flecked with gold, they twinkled with laughter at her desperate humping.

"My beautiful Annabel, you are eager," he chuckled down at her. He leaned in to sniffle against her neck, collecting her scent.

Massive claw-tipped hands raked her flanks with an unsettling delicacy. His split tongue flicked out to taste her skin. All the while his pulsing heat radiated into her core. The combination made her entire body quake in a delightful mixture of instinctual fear and irrepressible lust. Suddenly, she felt his razor-sharp teeth take a dangerous grip of her earlobe. She froze, a pleading whimper escaping her lips, entreating him.

"I do not enjoy being denied the pleasures of your body," he hissed menacingly.

"Never again," she whispered with conviction, turning into him and locking her arms behind his powerful neck, kissing him with unbridled passion.

She felt his hands slide down under her body, taking greedy fistfuls of her buttocks as he finally thrust forward with his hips, driving his huge, pulsing cock back into her depths.

He made no efforts to be gentle, pushing as far as he could with the massive power of his body. She gasped as her cervix was battered by the impact, her vagina quivering, expecting pain to flower within her. It didn't, but she could now feel his now pointed tip nuzzling into some sort of tiny entrance, she knew exactly what was on his mind and it terrified her.

"Please, don't, you'll hurt me," she entreated.

"I have no intention of taking your womb today, Annabel. I am not cruel, despite how the thought excites me," He contradicted his words with a small hunch forwards, forcing her cervix to spread around the very tip of his gigantic member in an entirely alien sensation. "Though I would dearly love to plant my seed here, with your permission?"

"Yes," she nodded hesitantly. Would he really do it, shoot his thick cream through her barrier, right into her womb? The thought was arousing in all the wrong ways. Or the right ones, she couldn't make up her mind. What would her mother think of her now? That thought made her giggle, tensing her abdomen in ways that must have felt delightful to him but dislodged his precarious coupling with her cervical opening.

He groaned in pleasure as her insides massaged his thick length. Securing his grip on her spectacular ass, he slowly eased back out of her exquisitely tight vagina, feeling her hot, slippery tissues resisting him all the way. It was a long journey until the ridge of his flared head felt cool air, her labia straining outwards in a final attempt to coax him back in.

The dragon paused for a moment, taking a breath. He savoured the thick scent of her arousal, the look of pleading devotion in her soft eyes, her thin, youthful body offered up to him. Then, with a powerful thrust, he pushed himself back into her until he bumped against her limit once again, releasing an animalistic snarl of pleasure as she yelped cutely beneath him.

Soon he was fucking her in earnest, pumping steadily in and out of her clinging sheath. Her frothy fluids soaked their joining, running onto the sheets below as he basked in the pleasure of mating his beautiful wife to be.

Annabel tried to get into a rhythm as his cock shuttled in and out of her. It was impossible, the sensations where too intense. Anyway, he seemed to enjoy manhandling her with the giant handfuls of springy ass in his draconian clutches.

So, she held on around his corded neck and let the pleasure build inside her, feeling him pound into her again and again. She was so damn full and despite the fact that he wasn't deliberately targeting them, her g-spot and clit were again taking a hammering as he long-dicked her with as much of him as she could take.

All she could do was squeeze her enhanced inner muscles in rhythm with his retreat as the tingles and twitches of pleasure built inside her. That and voice her rising passion loudly to the world.

"I'm doing it!" She squealed, "I'm fucking doing it and I love every second. I love this fucking cock!"

"You're so fucking good!" He groaned back, revelling in the initial feeling of his own threatening climax. "Hold on!"

He pushed himself upright, never faltering with his steady thrusts as he balanced on his knees, supporting her on his mighty cock and still kneading her bubble-like ass.

Annabel moaned as the change in angle put more pressure on the roof of her vagina, a mini orgasm blossomed instantaneously as most of her weight forced her cervix down onto him.

"Aaahhheeeee!" she squawked adorably as her sweating body tensed, quivering like a skittish mare as her orgasm fired over-taxed nerve endings again and again.

The dragon only gave her a moment's respite, letting out a pleasured growl before he resumed his hunching thrusts into her tight, squeezing passage. Having more freedom of movement now that he was on his knees, his motions became more forceful as he worked towards his own monumental release.

"Let go and lean back," He ordered gruffly, his cock never letting up.

"What?! Oh shit...I don't think... fuck..." Annabel was reluctant to comply; her arms were the only thing holding her upper body in the air. A sharp swat to her rump and a yelp later, she was convinced to slowly lengthen her grip around his neck until with a final slump, her shoulders were back on the freshly soiled bedding.

"Oh fuck!" he moaned, the movement tightening her entire channel as he still held her ass suspended. He redoubled his pace, letting more of his dragon's strength free to fuck her as it became clear he wasn't going to last. He had to sacrifice the length of his movements in this position, switching to shorter, deep thrusts. His incredibly sensitive cockhead twitched fiercely as her tight walls buckled down on him.

"Oh God... oh God, oh gggggoooodd, yeeeessssss!" Annabel wailed as she felt the fire inside her roar in approval, devouring his thrusts in an inferno of pure bliss.

The climax was too intense again. She tried to reach back up for him, change this hellishly contorted missionary-wheelbarrow position. It was like doing a sit-up and with his huge dick firmly embedded in her tummy, impossible. Where on earth had he learned something like this? From Susan, Claire? Her efforts squeezed him harshly, inflaming the sensation of her already spasming core muscles. Overcome, she slumped back down into the pillows with an adorable yelp. She relaxed, it was her only option. Smiling, embracing the sensations rolling through her. She accepted wonderful defeat, closing her eyes. The wet slap and squish of their sex lulled her as the dragon took her as he willed.

As her orgasm faded its zenith, his body finally gave into the pleasure of her coaxing, molten, little cunt. With a satisfied rumble, the dragon felt his large testes drawing upwards, eager to breed this young vixen. His cock tensed, expanding at the height of pleasure.

He relaxed his muscles briefly, trying to capture that pinnacle of sensation. So good his eyes squeezed shut. It was no use. His abdomen clenched as a deluge of slippery pre-come raced up his mammoth shaft, spewing forth in her already over-lubed depths. With just moments to spare, he thrust home, planting his very tip into the slot of her cervical opening. Instinct told him to drive it home, to claim her completely, and sink his fangs into her flesh, sealing their bond.

He denied himself, knowing it would come to pass one day. Then his thick, sperm-laden cream was racing up his shaft in great spurts, firing forcefully from his planted tip and hopefully into her deepest recesses. The idea satisfied his instinctive urge to breed as more pleasurable shudders expelled rope after rope of his magic infused semen on its way. He made sure to give her as much magic as he deemed safe, he would need her strong in the times to come.

Annabel moaned as she felt him notch into place, his almost scalding heat blossoming into depths she'd never knew existed. She could feel it, each potent, warm surge, sating her pheromone-induced lust so delightfully. It absolutely flooded her, filling her untried uterus quickly until it had nowhere to go and began flooding back into her already occupied vagina. The sensation renewed her orgasm to a gentle, continuous rumble. His magic infused her with that wonderfully familiar heavy, tired pleasure.

But rather than waning, the intensity of the sensation grew as he pumped more and more into her.

"C..Chris? Ohh... oh shit, what are you doing?" She protested weakly, overcome but squirming beneath him in a feeble effort to get away. It was unlike before; her body could somehow sense the vast energy being poured into it. If she'd been able to muster the strength to sit up, she would have seen Bartholomew twitching in seizure like fits, perched directly above her womb and the great vortex of magic that was being deposited there.

Finally, Chris groaned his completion as the last dribbles of thick, sticky cum left his throbbing tip. He gently laid her down, avoiding the large wet stain directly beneath their coupling. He held himself deep inside her, but left her beleaguered cervix be, hoping it would seal his offering inside and allow her to absorb as much energy as her body could catalyse. His large bulk settled onto her flushed, trembling from, providing gentle caresses and a comforting warmth now that their sweaty bodies were cooling down.

"I'm sorry, Dee. It must have been intense, I gave you a lot of magic. I need you and Bartholomew strong. We're not going to be able to rely on staying out of sight if Michelle's plan goes ahead. I want you to hold your own and be safe."

Her eyes stared up at him searchingly for a moment before she raised her exhausted limbs to wrap around him again, urging more of his weight onto her tired body, eager for the contact.

He complied, settling further onto her, eliciting a happy sigh.

"I'll be at your side, Chris," She assured him tiredly. "A lot has changed since your transformation, I can't sense your presence like the others do but they're looking up to you now, I can tell. You're even more powerful than before. I refuse to be your Achilles heel. I'll do whatever I have to keep us safe and you should too. If that means overloading me with magic and getting more training, I'll do it."

"Would you... do you think you could forgo finding a job? I think your time would be better spent learning more about your bond with Bartholomew," He asked.

"Yes, you're right," She admitted.

They lay together like that for a long time. His cock softened but they found he could stay inside her if they didn't move. It suited Annabel just fine, surrounded by his warmth, completely overshadowed by his huge half-dragon form. She could feel his cum oozing slowly out onto the soaked bedding. They were going to have to air the mattress and leave a window open tomorrow.

"Okay, time for me to get up," He kissed her cute little nose. "Gotta hit the shower and make Susan her coffee, who knows what will happen after that. I'm back in action, baby!"

"Nooo!" she complained impishly. "More cuddles. I love it when you're on top of me like this."

She squeezed her vagina around his softened member as if coaxing him to stay.

"Okay, Dee, just a few more minutes," He nuzzled her soft, sweat-damp skin, moving to coax her wild sex hair around and over one shoulder. He moved his head next to hers on the side with less hair and they began whispering sweetnesses to one another as dawn broke over the city outside their little bubble of love.

***

With the hot water cascading down his half-dragon body, Chris lent his head forwards into the tiled wall with a happy sigh. He was enjoying the full body sensation of heat soaking through his tiny scales. The mixer was set all the way in the red, testing the hotel's industrial gas water heaters to the limit as steam billowed around him, stimulating the flow of thoughts milling around his head.

Annabel, currently indulging in a post coital sleep in, had said something that had inflamed an issue he'd been worrying with recently. She'd said he was more powerful, that others were looking up to him. It was true. But why?

He certainly wasn't used to dealing with that sort of pressure, however self-imposed it might be.

To make matters worse, this power was not entirely his own. At the very least, he couldn't explain how he came to possess it. That was all he'd managed to conclude so far from the mysterious, painful encounter with that visiting presence.

He hadn't received any great epiphany, gifting him divine purpose. Wouldn't that be nice? Knowing exactly why he was the way he was and what he needed to do?

That left him with a lack of purpose. He had this power, but what was the point if he didn't use it?

He began examined his immediate goals.

It was good to be in his hybrid form, letting his dragon out was always deeply pleasurable. It also granted him a fuller perspective of his true desires.

Procreation was at the top of the list. Chris might try placing most of the blame on the dragon but couldn't deny the power of that most basic desire. It wasn't just about saving his endangered species either. The thought of his child growing in Annabel or Susan sent blood surging to his loins and his itch dripping from his fangs. That urge was becoming stronger too. Whenever he even interacted with a woman, those thoughts would pop into his perverted brain, distracting him.

He was going to be a father soon and that also weighed heavily upon him. He needed to provide a safe, nurturing environment for his growing family. Building his stronghold and coming to grips with his new powers must therefore be at the top of his priorities.

It went beyond that though. The world must be made safe around them so that he and his brood could raise their young ones in peace. They should lack for nothing and enjoying everything this wonderful planet and its diverse inhabitants had to offer. There was no reason for the maladies beleaguering both humans and Beings. Magic existed but he had yet to see it put to any widespread good, to help people selflessly.

There must be a sickness clawing up from the depths of their societies that they found themselves in this state. Whatever it was, he wanted to be a powerful force opposed to it. To do some good so that not only his children but all young ones could inherit a better world than this one, balanced on the knife's edge of disaster.

But what could he do to make that happen? Become some sort of magical philanthropist? Maybe, but humans had plenty of problems too and magic couldn't help them, not yet anyway.

All he'd gotten for his efforts into unwrapping the mystery of that fateful encounter so far was a better understanding of the physical universe. It wasn't that this knowledge wasn't interesting, in fact it was opening his eyes to the complexity and wonder of everything around him. It still didn't explain his strange existence, or that of his visitor.

His musings were interrupted by the flutter of tiny bat-like wings, and the feeling of little feet landing on his shoulder.

"Immi," he raised his head and turned to look at her ever-naked, miniature perfection.

"Good morning, Master!" She chirped.

"Good morning, little one," He replied more happily, her infectious mirth was hard to ignore. "What have you been up to?"

She giggled, bringing one finger to her lips and cocking her hips impishly.

"I shouldn't say," was her <a>coquettish </a>response as she took a hold of his hair and tried to lean out over his body, looking down admiringly at his heavy package.

Clearly, she was in one of her teasing moods. He waited, suspecting that she couldn't wait to spill her own beans. She had that mischievous look about her, not that that was unusual by any means.

Sure enough, after a few moments she stamped her little foot in frustration and began her tale.

"Well I was sleeping just fine in the linen closet when I was woken up by this great deluge of magic nearby," She was drawing out the details but Chris had a good idea where this was going already.

"Naturally I went to investigate, make sure everyone was okay. Ya' know?" She continued.

"Naturally," he chuckled.

"You wouldn't believe what I found! My Mistress lying fuck-drunk on a sodden, dirty bed. There were traces of all sorts of nasty fluids everywhere so I just had to clean them up. Any good sprite would. Even worse, there was a huge ball of magic deep inside Mistress, so far up her I couldn't get to it. That was certainly frustrating. But do you know what was worst of all?"
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 14|
--------------------------------------------
"What was that, Immi?" he asked, humouring the little blue devil-woman.

"Well I just can't believe someone would have so much fun with Mistress without inviting me! Aren't I a good sprite? Have I been bad?" she squeaked with apparent distress.

"No Immi, you're a good sprite," he smiled. "Although teasing your Master like this won't earn you any gold stars."

"Gold stars? Doesn't Master enjoy my little teasing?" she asked curiously.

"Never mind, Immi. Yes, I do enjoy your antics but sometimes it's very frustrating that I can't act on my desires with you," He tried to explain.

"Oh Chris, what would you do to me, if you could?"

Her breathless question, whispered directly into his ear made him growl in frustration, his unrelenting cock beginning to stir. An errant thought made him pause mid growl... he'd done it with Annabel.

"Master?" She questioned his sudden pause.

He reached up, offering his hand as a perch. She quickly flounced onto it, straddling a thick purple finger and leaning forwards into his palm. With a sigh, she brought her head to rest upon his forearm, her little blue tits pressed firmly into him.

He turned out of the shower spray, observing her for a moment before asking his fateful question.

"Immi, would it be okay if I cast an enchantment on you?"

She rolled over languidly, looking up at him with curious eyes. Her wings wrapped around to conceal her breasts with artificial demureness.

"Of course, Master. I'm bound to you, I will accept any gift or punishment you see fit."

"Well, hopefully what I've got in mind doesn't turn out to be a punishment," he laughed. "If the enchantment works, I think we will both enjoy the results."

"What are you going to do to me?" her inquisitiveness was peaked as she sat up to regard him.

"It's a surprise," He loved the impetuous frown that formed on her brow at being denied.

"That's mean," She complained.

"Shhh. Sit still little one, this is going to be big. Let me concentrate," He hushed her.

With the sprite still, he wrapped his hands around her, cupping as much of her foot-long body in his clawed grasp as he could. He began concentrating on the energy that was already gathering within him, reaching deep into that shining well and pulling up metaphorical bucket loads of rich, purple-tinged magic.

His intention was clear in his mind's eye, his dragon was confident of the outcome. A normal-sized Immianthe, just as tall as Annabel, beautiful and mischievous as ever but having overcome their staggering size difference.

The enchantment he prepared was to be the guide for this change, the blueprint. It would be too much to change her all in one go, he could sense that. Her body would rebel against it. But over time, with unknown quantities of magic, he dearly hoped his vision would be possible.

The energy was quivering through every cell in his body now, rising higher and higher, painful to hold. It was becoming dangerous. Steam suddenly billowed into the bathroom. The hot water was evaporating instantly against him, his scale-skin growing hotter and hotter. The steam overwhelmed the extraction fan instantly, creating a thick, hard to breathe mist that scalded their sensitive airways.

Immi was squirming uncomfortably in the heat, using her own magic to shield herself against it.

"Master, not so much! This is dangerous!" she panicked, her attuned senses warning her of the volatile magic he was struggling to contain.

"A little more," he wheezed between interlocking, sharp teeth. "Just a little bit more."

"You'll hurt..." she was interrupted by the bestial roar that ripped up his throat, rebounding around the sauna-like bathroom. More shocking was the feeling of cool tendrils of energy brushing against her, seeking entrance.

He had loosed his enchantment and she felt it worming slowly through her natural defences. She was frightened as one after another, her strong barriers fell helplessly, like concrete being cracked apart by the roots of some great tree. She hadn't bargained on this. What was he trying to do to her?

Immi panicked, screamed, sure that her Master had betrayed her and was about to use her in some sort of sick ritual. That was the fate of her race, was it not? Tears streaked her cheeks as she was finally laid bare, her defences shattered and the evil enchantment tickling her very core, about to consume her. She struggled against him helplessly, the cruel Master to whom she had given herself fully. She had so hoped for happiness.

Chris had to physically restrain her diminutive form as she railed against his protective hold. He could tell the enchantment needed more time to integrate. It had a slow working nature on purpose to increase the chances of success. He hadn't bargained on her fighting him at this crucial moment.

"Immi! Please! Calm down. I'm not trying to hurt you."

Thankfully, it was then that the spell began merging with her own pure essence, flooding into her senses and giving her a glimpse of its intention and method of action.

She gasped, stilling her struggle. It was beautiful, a wonderful gift. She should have known he would never hurt her and began admonishing herself harshly as the images swam lazily into her blurry vision.

She was straddling him, sinking down on his erection. Her hands supported herself on his muscular chest, looking down at his happy face. Her fingers looked so big and he was actually sinking easily inside of her, filling her so wonderfully. As the vision faded, she looked to the side and saw her reflection in a mirror. She inhaled sharply, her body was huge as her ass came to rest on his thighs, wings twitching in obvious pleasure. She was the size of a regular woman!

Her eyes snapped open, gazing up at him in wonder. The last of her magical resistance fell as her very being raced to embrace the enchantment that offered her everything she could desire. Her vision blurred again, fresh tears wetting her eyes but they were happy tears this time.

"Oh, Master! I'm sorry!" her throat was thick with emotion.

"It's okay, Immi," he slumped down the wall of the shower cubicle, wings a-strew as the last of the energy he'd gathered left his body. His enervated limbs heavy and tired from the effort of containing such magic. Still that new wellspring bubbled up in his core, refilling his depleted reserves at a steady rate.

Immi fluttered up to his shoulder again, pressing her entire body against the side of his head.

"You make me so happy, Chris," She cooed adoringly. "I'm going to grow. It may take time but I will make it worth the wait."

"I'll hold you to it, Immi," He turned his head, giving her small tummy a playful raspberry.

"A feeding right now would get the process started nicely, don't you think?" She angled, even thoughtful of the bottomless pit that was her stomach.

"Good Lord, what have I unleashed," Chris was momentarily frightened by the potential seriousness of his actions. "Will your appetite increase as you grow?"

"Who can say, I'm sure you're up to the task, dragon. Especially when the extraction process can be so... rewarding," the coy little creature teased.

"Well, when you put it like that, I suppose the prospect of being fucked dry by a ravenous sprite doesn't sound so bad."

"Master, you know exactly what I want to hear."

Chris concentrated again, bringing forward a comparatively tiny chunk of energy, transforming it into the sprite's breakfast cube before he forced himself up and out of the shower.

He left her munching happily on the bathroom sink as he towelled off, putting on only a pair of boxer shorts. He had plans to stay in this form just a little longer.

Annabel was still snoozing blissfully so he went to the kitchen and set the kettle to boil, putting some coffee grinds in a modest sized plunger. He browsed Maginet for a few moments as he waited for the water, clearing his inbox of several solicitous messages which had gotten around his spam filter already. It made him think though, he could be more generous with his energy. There were Beings who struggled to scrape together enough magic to increase their basic quality of life above human levels.

The rumbling of the kettle brought him back to the present and he turned it off just before it finished, carefully pouring the sub-boiling water over the pungent coffee grounds. That wonderful scent bloomed into the room, tickling his sensitive snout.

A few minutes of steeping later, he poured a large mug and snuck quietly into Susan's room. He left her coffee on the bedside table to wake her as he knew it would once her mind registered the smell. He only took the liberty of brushing a lock of the witch's beautiful midnight hair away from her face and leaning down to plant a loving kiss near her ear. As much as he would have liked to climb into bed and wake her with his affections, he had a pair of dragonesses to deal with.

Lillian wasn't present to question his departure from the apartment and he wasn't about to barge into her room just to ask permission to walk across the hall. So, he didn't feel too guilty as he snuck out the door.

Despite his recent romp with Annabel, his excitement was palpable as he knocked on the door and waited for an answer.

It was a sleepy, ruffled Petra who opened the door hurriedly after using the peephole to see who was calling at this unsocial hour.

The specimen of dragon perfection that greeted her made her insides churn instantly. His hybrid form was huge, exquisitely masculine, and smelled so damn-good that she didn't even bother to ask why he was here. This was her mate, her sire, father of the new life growing in her womb. She wrapped her full figure up against him, purring provocatively.

Her pink sleep shorts hit the wooden floor as the door closed. He shuffled her inside, kissing her firmly. The almost identical layout of rooms and furniture to his own suite momentarily confused him. It ended up working to his advantage though, as he knew there was likely a couch in the living room, perfect for what he had in mind.

Scant moments later, Petra found herself bent over the end of said couch, feeling his monstrous erection playing up and down her already glistening slit. Having had a fleeting glance at it when he'd dropped his boxers, she could tell he was certainly the largest lover she'd attempted in her four and a half centuries, not that she'd had that many. She wasn't too concerted though; confident she could accommodate him with a little time to adjust and some restraint on his part.

Besides, her dragon was nigh rabid with lust. At this point she didn't care if he hurt a little. She needed her mate inside her again.

She keened happily as he leant down and sunk his sharp fangs into the tender skin of her shoulder, right next to the white spaghetti strap of her loose tank top. His itch flooded her system again, inflaming her, priming her entire reproductive system. He'd already knocked her up though so this was just for fun, the energy he gave her would help make his offspring hearty and strong.

He could feel her opening rippling around the very tip of his cockhead as his venom spread quickly, making her body shudder and needy noises pour from her lips. It was going to be so satisfying to ravage this mature goddess before moving on to her also pregnant daughter and doing it all over again.

As an excited spurt of slimy pre-come twitched from his tip, he retracted his fangs and took a firm grip on her waist. His fat crown sunk in slowly with consistent pressure from his hips, finally slipping into her talented, snug vagina. He felt her quiver beneath him, adjusting to his large intrusion.

He allowed himself tiny thrusts against her reluctant labia. Spread wide around his girth, it wasn't long until her leaking juices told him it was time for more. Looking down at her wide hips, he watched the erotic sight of his huge, throbbing member sinking deeper into her naturally hairless quim. He groaned in pleasure as her velvet channel squeezed him relentlessly.

She was panting. By the Great Wind he was big, filling her all the way up, just like he had when he'd taken her as a full dragon. It wasn't long until he was bumping up against her cervix. She felt for him, there was no way he was more than two thirds inside her. She wished she could give him more room to work with but it was just the way dragons were built. Now that she carried his child, no longer was the end of her vagina the squishy, welcoming ring of muscle that she'd happily allowed him access to. It had become a firm barrier, protecting the still microscopic spark of life embedded in the nourishing tissue of her womb.

As he nudged against her in combined pleasure and frustration, she scolded him over her shoulder, calling him a naughty, wicked boy for wanting her womb again. That earned her a series of harsh swats to her creamy rump, turning the jiggling flesh a fetching shade of red. He backed off on the length of his thrust though and got down to the business of fucking her.

After his hand stopped tingling from spanking her deliciously full-bodied ass, Chris remembered how effective his shallow, rapid thrusts had been on Annabel. He applied the same technique to the mature dragoness, plunging his now glistening erection down into her pungent, slippery pussy. He would have liked to be able to sink a bit deeper inside her but it was simply impossible with her pregnancy.

His hand reached forward, collecting a huge fistful of her silky silver tresses. He was careful to grip near the roots, applying constant pressure as he pulled her head back while pushing her lower back firmly into the cushions. Her arched body provided the perfect angle for his assault. He sped his thrusts, breathing heavily as her tight passage squeezed around him.

It didn't take much of his shallow thrusting against her sensitive G-spot before she was a quivering, gooey mess. Absolutely consumed in her orgasm, her silken, experienced cunt offered up every caress and ripple it could muster to coax out his seed. A few little gushes of woman-cum even splattered out around their tight coupling, making a mess of the couch beneath them.

She sang effusive praises from her lips all the while, stroking his ego, promising she had never had a better, larger, or more virile lover. She promised too that together they would repopulate the entire dragon race single handedly, that she would happily allow him to impregnate her over and again with no end.

It was quite exciting for Chris. This woman knew exactly what buttons to press to appeal to his base draconian desires, for she had them too. He loved her for it, redoubling his efforts to pleasure her into oblivion. She deserved everything he had to offer, this beautiful, fertile dragoness who had already experienced the sadness of losing her mate. He would give her everything she desired, filling her over and over, keeping her in loving captivity by virtue of constantly carrying his children.

He roared his triumph, thick pulses of energy-rich cum basting her cervix.

She cried out her own joy as well, more and more of his pearly cream flooding her strained cunt. It quickly overflowed her capacity and squelching back out around their joining in snowy, shining globs.

His abdomen flexed in pleasurable contractions as his mighty phallus seeded her again with every twitch. Meanwhile her exultant pussy milked him, squeezing for everything he had in a prolonged climax.

His magic soared through her body, astounding her with its quantity. It was like he was trying to get her pregnant all over again. It was insane that he had that much to give away.

He pulled as far out as he could, making more room for his cum inside her. With just the tip of his cock in position at her swollen labia, he deposited a couple more thick blasts.

Unfortunately, she was full to the brim and so he pulled free of her altogether, panting heavily, sweat trickling down his back. His last few squirts shot violently up across her jiggling ass and sinuous lower back. One particularly tenacious streak made it all the way to the back of her neck. It made a long, wet streak on her tank top and finished up getting lost in the sea of half-wet platinum blond hair he still gripped.

Releasing her impromptu pony tail, he took a hand to his dribbling, throbbing shaft. He lewdly played his seed over the rosy skin of her ass, marking her as his. He pushed softly back into her quivering snatch, watching indulgently as his seed was forced to dislodge, running down over her mound and tummy, onto the couch. Finally satisfied, he leaned down, kissing the spent dragoness' ear and murmuring that he was going to come back tomorrow morning and have her again.

A flicker of motion at the nearby bedroom doorway caught both their attention. As they looked up in unison, they caught a glimpse of her daughter's sultry strut back into her bedroom. She'd been watching for some time now, enjoying the sight of her mother being so thoroughly mated.

With a parting swat to her cum-splattered, rosy bottom, the male was up and after the younger female, eager to sample her delights as well.

Petra sighed happily, catching her breath and reaching back to massage her smarting rear-end. Her hand came away slimy and she quickly brought the offending digits to her lips, sampling her mate's rich essence.

His magic was riding her veins like a ship in high seas, inundating her. She hurriedly diverted as much as she could handle towards her womb, towards their precious creation. It wasn't easy to concentrate so much magic in one part of her body. Still more of him couldn't be contained, dissolving slowly into her cells, invigorating her. Even more was pooled in her vagina, slowly leaking out with his spend.

This was what she'd been missing. All those lonely years raising her daughter by herself. Her heart thumped heavily, circulating joy around her system. She had a mate again!

The dragoness rolled over, uncaring for the hygiene of the already ruined sofa. She got comfortable, snuggling into the cushions for a lazy nap as her daughter's lustful cries began issuing from the bedroom.

<em>Hey guys, the first (and shorter) split of what was originally chapter 8. More to follow.</em> 

<em>Fair warning, this chapter has pseudo-incest themes again.</em>

<em>Enjoy.</em> 

*** 

Chris' muscles heaved, beads of sweat dislodging, combining, and running down his bare skin. A salty, miniature flash flood, gaining momentum before wicking into the already moist waist of his tatty old jeans. With bestial strength, he hoisted the sturdy canvas sack of crushed rock off the heavy-duty trolley onto his shoulder with a dry rustle. He turned ponderously and looked toward the pre-fab concrete stairs. 

Pausing to steady his breathing and his thoughts, he concentrated on the huge sack on his shoulder and mass of stone within. He reached inward, embracing his element, his magic and dragged his load with him. With a tiny flicker, he vanished from the physical plane and began trudging up the stairs. 

Usually murky and barren, the Ether landscape before him was instead a stairwell overgrown with jungle-like verdant growth. Carrying a quarter ton of crushed rock up several flights of stairs was much easier for him in the Ether. Here, the physical effort it would cost him in the Norm was attenuated by his own magic, making the gruelling work much faster and less physically exhausting. The result, however, was that he bled energy into the surrounding ether. Within days, the first opportunistic leafy, alien growths were sprouting out of ghostly rock walls and insubstantial concrete. 

Now days he gave them, and the more active Ether inhabitants that followed them to this new oasis of magic, little notice. Every time he made that long, double-backing journey up the multiple-landing stairwell, he cursed himself for agreeing that they dig a full two stories below the surface. Why, oh why, had he ever thought an underground house was a good idea? 

Every time he complained, Stephen assured him it had been an excellent decision. The werebison would remind him that the rock was more stable down there. It would provide extra disincentive for anyone to blast or dig their way down. Still, in times like this, toward the end of an exhausting day, Chris questioned the sanity of this entire endeavour on a minute by minute basis. 

When he finally reached the top, he merged back. His breath came heavily and more sweat trickled down his back. The free-flowing air of the warehouse floor was blessedly dust-free and cool, soothing his bellowing lungs. He wasted no time dumping the big sack onto the waiting pallet. That made a full load of four. 

Straightening his massive body, Chris reached high above his head to stretch the aches from his tired muscles and let his breathing settle. 

His bared chest, arms and abdomen were streaked with dirt, dust, and even a couple of trails of dried blood. He found that the scrapes and scratches he suffered lugging the sacks of crushed rock out of the dig were better than paying for the replacement shirts. Three had been ruined in the first week of work and he gave up after that. Even whilst destroying his clothing, he had collected scrapes anyway. 

It was almost time to go home, just a few more loads. 

With a heavy sigh, he slid into the seat of the waiting electric forklift, hoisted the pallet, and piloted the quiet mechanical workhorse out of the warehouse to the growing mound at the back of the yard. His seemingly endless work had once again swelled the pile of rubble as if by magic. It was a good thing the truck would be coming in for a pickup soon, he'd made substantial progress since it was here last. 

If he really put his back into the work, like he had today, he could haul a bit over three truckloads worth of the shit out of the depths by the end of the day. 

He'd been helping every day he could for over two months now and the romance of building his own house was well and truly gone. 

With practiced, efficient movements, he unsealed, upended, and emptied the sacks one by one. The crushed rock made a dry rattle as it settled, a sound so familiar now that it had intruded into his dreams on more than one occasion. 

A few endeavouring rocks bounced away from the pile, colliding with the parked bucket-loader's great tyres. Stephen had hired the big earthmoving machine to load the trucks that came to collect the rock for a local landscaping supplier. Chris had had a chance to drive the thing briefly, but the articulated steering system was a challenge to master and the task of loading a truck was far out of his comfort zone. He only wished the loader could somehow be driven down below, cutting out the need for all his backbreaking work. 

As if on autopilot, he found himself back inside the warehouse, descending the wide stairwell with his empty sacks. At the bottom, he collected his trolley. He trundled back through the ominous portal into the solid rock, down the short, wide hallway which would soon be a high security entrance. 

Lillian had had her input there, insisting on a multi-door airlock-like system which would soon be getting installed. 

He donned his constricting breathing mask, which helped to filter out the rock dust that was always heavy in the air when they were working. 

Beyond, the passage widened into a space that would be a modest foyer. In the dim light, the bare rock walls looked unnaturally smooth. No drilling tool or jackhammer score marks, just smooth, geometrically perfect rock. 

As the entrance way ended, the huge, barren kitchen space that had literally been carved from the rock was directly to his right. It had naturally been one of the first spaces they'd excavated. He could see into the murky space over the top of a low wall of stone that had been left behind to eventually form one of the large benchtop areas. 

<em>At least you can see the rooms taking shape now</em>, he thought. A month ago, it had been difficult to see that they were making any real progress at all. 

Stephen insisted that they cut the rooms directly into the rock, leaving behind as many features, walls, and columns as possible in the original stone. It would save them time, work, and money when it came to finishing the house, not having to build as many internal structures. Chris had to agree, with the added benefit of less rock to cart up and out of his future home. 

To the left, the open plan living and dining room stretched out in a huge rectangle. The long side formed the outside edge of the structure, only one dark portal leading to a modest study. It was by far the largest space in the building plans, taking two whole weeks to hollow out. 

That had been after Chris had bit the bullet and asked Stephen to hire help. The three-strong goblin crew Stephen found had been more than happy to assist with cutting and crushing the rock for a reasonable price. From the sounds reaching him, they were hard at work right now. 

Construction lights provided harsh illumination but were only ever placed where they were working or in the walkways. This meant some areas were very well lit while others oozed a complete darkness that would put any moonless night to shame. The first time Chris had experienced the encompassing blackness of being underground, he'd been very unnerved. Now he knew the rooms and passageways so well he liked to think that should the power go out, he wouldn't even bump into anything. 

He pulled the trolley down the familiar, dusty trail, across the reddish-brown sandstone floor, past the kitchen and thick support column marking half way in the living room. To his right, he marked off the dark, open doorways to pitch black rooms as he passed them. Laundry, storage room, and finally the large bathroom as the living room ended. 

On the wall to his left, they would soon be excavating his own master bedroom but that was to be the last of the rooms they dug out. The junction of living room, bathroom, and his future bedroom was a four by four meter square. However, it's position and alignment with the rest of the rooms made him think of it as a diamond. 

It was a strange feature but one of Chris' favourite parts of the design. The bottom corner of the diamond, where he now stood, was open to the living room. The wall to his right was also the bathroom's wall, the wall to his left would be one of the walls of his bedroom. The top of the diamond was also open, leading to two hallways which stretched off at right angles to each other but parallel to the rest of the squared walls in the house. 

You would walk through the middle of the diamond to access the hallways. On either side as you walked was a triangle shaped space which Chris planned to use for housing bookshelves or something like that. 

Inlaid in the floor, dead centre of the diamond was a burnished ring of stainless steel, roughly one metre in diameter and about an inch thick. Inside the circle, one pointing at each of the compass points, were four polished amethysts. This arrangement, apart from being visually appealing, was the magical heart of the structure. It was protected by a thick cover-sheet of enhanced glass which was magicked to resist scuffing and scratching. 

Chris had already filled the modest gemstones to the brim with energy and Stephen had been tying his enchantments into them as their work progressed. 

At the moment, these spells were basic; magically strengthening the rock around them (after they excavated) so that it didn't fall on their heads in a freak accident, making the structure resistant to vibration, and repelling water in a large area around the exterior. 

It was a new concept to Chris and he was excited by the idea of having a magical component to his home. Stephen even assured him that once they were done, he would attach a spell so that dust would never settle inside, forcing it to be filtered out by the advanced systems which would soon be supplying a clean flow of conditioned air, pumped down from the surface. 

All they had for now were a couple of large stationary fans which made sure the air circulated and didn't go stale. Chris hated them because they swirled the dust up annoyingly at times. 

The central diamond room also helped separate the house into two parts, allowing a thick section of solid rock to remain between them. This provided a strength buffer and meant they would need less supports overall. There was also to be a secret passage dug upwards from the diamond room to act as a bolt hole or emergency exit. The plan was to have it come out somewhere hidden in the yard up above. 

The loud, scraping shriek of crunching rock grew harsher as soon as he passed through the diamond room. Up the hallway to his left, he could see Stephen on a ladder, drill in hand as he bolted some cable supports into the bare rock. 

At just over two and a half metres above the floor, lofty ceilings had been another of Chris' banes. The extra height made for so much more rock to move. Stephen insisted it would be vital in making the underground rooms seem more spacious and less oppressive. 

That hallway was finished, at least the excavation was. Five bedrooms, two smaller bathrooms, a large study, and a utility closet for the industrial air conditioning and filtration system lay down that way. There was also room in there for three small water tanks which would act as a reserve if they were ever cut off for a few weeks. 

In front of him, on the other side of the thick wall of sandstone, was another large, open space. It occupied the corner formed as the two hallways took off at right angles. This was to be some sort of large multipurpose space. He wasn't sure what exactly it would be useful for but with the number of people he was catering for now, as well as an expanding family, he had to plan. 

The end of the hallway to his right was his destination and he grudgingly pulled the trolley towards the sound of the hard at work goblins. 

He hadn't expected to be the mule of the construction team, carting the waste rock up to the surface all day. It just sort of worked out that way. That wasn't all he did, but it did take the majority of his time. Several times a day, he would help Stephen with some task or other, but then it would be back to carting rock. 

Despite his best efforts to discover or invent ways to magic the tons of crushed rock out of existence, he was still carting it by hand. Rock was a stable matter. It had inherent energy contained in its structure and was quite happy to stay as it was, thank you very much. You couldn't just blast it to oblivion or dissolve it to component atoms on this scale without both massive energy input and catastrophic release, Stephen said. Such was unheard of in this day and age. Not that Chris hadn't tried, he was so sick of hauling rocks. 

It wasn't that the others were unwilling to help him, it just wasn't efficient. Chris' natural strength and endurance kept him chugging away all day. He was the best physically suited out of the five of them for the task. Besides, he was the unskilled labour. It didn't make sense to have Stephen hauling rock and Chris bungling the installation of the electrical, air, gas, magical, and plumbing systems. 

Stephen didn't shy away from carting rock when he wasn't busy with other tasks. Even Lillian and Oslo had been roped into hauling a few loads during their shifts babysitting him in the early days. Those days of constant supervision were over now.  

By himself, on a day like today, it was all he could do to keep up with the goblins. 

The three brothers, Yurt, Gruff, and Belthelas, made a slick, rock-crunching dream team. They worked together, magically cutting out manageable chunks of stone from the working face before crushing and bagging them for Chris to transport. 

Chris had grown fond of the three once he got over their appearance. Safe out of sight underground, they preferred their natural forms. This allowed them to more efficiently use the magic Chris gave them to hack away at the rock, undistracted by holding their human guises. 

Their green-grey skin, spikey dark hair, red tinged eyes, small tusks, pointed ears, and overabundance of piercings gave them an intimidating appearance despite their relatively small, wiry bodies. In their human disguise, they took the appearance of a trio of small punks, boisterous and eager to start trouble. 

At just over five feet, Chris had mused that they probably wouldn't pose much of a threat on an individual basis. However, his dragon had assured him that goblins tended to overwhelm their opponents with numbers and took pride in fighting as dirty as possible. 

They were more than a little rough around the edges, cursing almost religiously in every sentence. Relatively recent immigrants from United Kingdom, their accents hadn't faded much which made their tough guy attitudes more credible or hilarious, depending on how you looked at it. 

Thankfully, they were quite friendly under their rougher shells. They held Chris in some sort of joking reverence, manufacturing an ever-changing series of nicknames for him. 

Stephen had worked with them once before as part of a team constructing a private mansion. He'd brought them on to speed up the digging when Chris had started to realise how long it was going to take just the two of them to finish the house. They had been an immense help, more than tripling their rate of progress. 

It also helped that Chris had them juiced up to the eyeballs. They each wore a small crystal on a chain around their necks which Chris charged as necessary for them to power their cutting spells. Without having to worry about exhausting themselves, they worked like a team of small, sweat-covered demons all day. They were perpetually trying to overwhelm his ability to carry the rock up to the surface and create a backlog. That was part of the reason he was working so hard, just to keep up. 

As a bonus for their manic effort, Chris had started filling the crystals at the end of the day for them to take home, inspiring a work ethic the likes of which he'd never seen. Who knows what sort of mischief they got up to each night because the gems were religiously presented for refilling the next morning. 

The results were clear to see, the house had taken shape at a much more encouraging rate. Today they had started on the last of the 4 bedrooms down the right hallway, leaving only his own bedroom, the emergency exit, and various small service channels left to excavate. 

It was a good thing, too. After the coming weekend, Chris would be formally starting his work with Michelle and the newly formed BIA. He was going to have much less time to help. 

Once the digging was done, Stephen and the goblins could easily finish the more conventional side of the construction. It was still going to be a big task, sealing cracks, installing insulation, ducting, wiring, plumbing, plastering the walls, putting down underlay, carpeting, floorboards, tiling, installing fixtures and appliances. The list was almost unending, but Chris felt that the home stretch was in sight. 

He was certainly going to have to celebrate somehow after the last oversized sack of rocks was hauled off. 

It wasn't in his initial vision to have the place as a nine bedroom underground mini-mansion. As he and Stephen had gone through the process of purchasing the property and drawing up the design, it became clear his needs were expanding rapidly. Therefore, everything was oversized, designed to cater for more than the already ridiculous eight people who would be moving in once it was complete. It was also laid out to allow for excavation of further rooms, if they were required. 

As he pulled the trolley the last few feet he sighed loudly within the oppressive warmth of the dust mask. Breathing was never satisfying within its stifling grip. These were his last moments of respite before the back-breaking cycle repeated. 

Belthelas looked up from the sack he was filling, dropping his shovel guiltily as he caught sight of the hulking young man. The goblin straightened, shooting him a mock salute. 

"You've over-filled it again, haven't you," Chris accused. As if the quarter ton sacks weren't heavy enough without the goblin trying to test his limits. 

"Wouldn't dream of it, Boss-Man." He winked, lifting the large ear-muff off one of his pointed, gaudily pierced ears. Raucous death-metal spilled out of the speaker inside, mingling with the already grating noises of tortured rock as Gruff and Yurt cut out another large slab. 

Chris groaned, seeing that the goblins already had three sacks ready and tied off, waiting for him. There wouldn't be any break for him. By the time he got those three to the base of the stairwell, they'd be ready with the fourth. If he dawdled, they would get ahead of him and he would never hear the end of it. 

Without further ado, Chris pulled the trolley up beside the offending sack, grabbed fistfuls of the loose canvas near the top, and hoisted it up the few inches onto the trolley. He shot Belthelas a dirty look, there was extra weight in that one. The goblin was oblivious, already loading the first shovel-loads of crushed rock into a waiting sack. 

He placed another fully loaded sack on the trolley before starting the journey back to the stairwell. They were dumped there while he went back for a further two. Then came the four torturous trips up those stairs, his entire body protesting all the way. 

It was as he started up the last flight of stairs on that fourth trip that he caught a brief wisp of her scent in the Ether, so contrasting to the smell of his own sweat and the rock dust permanently lodged in his nose. 

He phased back early and cautiously took the last steps up onto the warehouse floor under his own titanic effort. He looked around, half expecting to be pounced on. It didn't take long to spot her sitting sideways in the seat of the forklift. One of her bronzed legs dangled down over the side, the other was pulled up to her chest, foot also on the seat. That might not have been so bad had she not been wearing a white miniskirt.

--------------------------------------------
"Hello, Hailey." His dragon lurched forward inside him at the sight of her. He managed to keep his cool and place the heavy sack down on the pallet. 

Over the past two months, she'd been showing up at the construction site every few days. At first it seemed relatively innocent, bringing her dad some lunch, kindly dropping off a cooler of ice cold refreshments for them all, things like that. Stephen teased Chris openly that she'd never shown so much interest in his work before. 

She was shy towards him, only exchanging a few words but as the weeks passed, she grew bolder. Soon she was engaging him in conversation, staying to keep him company during lunch. 

He should have spurned her then and there, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it. He liked her. She even shared his newfound passion for understanding the working of the physical universe, only more so. She was a self-professed amateur astronomer and a proud nerd. He could talk to her about the chemistry and physics he'd been studying in his own time and she was genuinely interested, suggesting further sub-topics for him to explore. It was incredibly gratifying to have his effort shared and commended. 

That was when he'd realised she was wickedly smart. Stephen always crowed that his little girl was gifted. Chris had to agree, she'd already been taking online college courses in engineering for three years now. When asked about it, she'd sheepishly admitted that she hoped to one day work for NASA. 

Most werebeings ended up finding a trade, like her father and Jethry. Their abilities tended towards the physical and as a result, nature balanced them with poor magical potential. That wasn't always the case, but it was true for Hailey. So, she applied herself to her studies and was determined to become an aerospace engineer. 

Hailey soon realised Chris was a nice, down to earth guy. The gossip on Maginet, which she admitted to getting a little caught up in at times, had it all wrong. Sure, he was wonderfully powerful but the rumours never captured his humble nature, his cute embarrassment. In all their interaction, he never once looked down on her as a lowly class 5 magic user. Beings like him wouldn't normally give her the time of day. 

Things were right on track for them forming a fast friendship until one afternoon a few weeks back. To Chris, it was like a switch had been flipped. Her girlish crush turned to downright seduction. Shyness blossomed into blatant interest. Gone was the embarrassed girl who'd run back up the stairs to her room that first time they'd met. This determined young woman made it clear that she wanted him. 

She dressed up, or more often, down when she came to visit the job site. She became more tactile, taking any excuse to touch or brush against him. Her visits became more frequent and she brought him homemade baking several times. She engineered reasons to get him alone. 

Apart from the awkwardness Chris felt around Stephen as his daughter openly lavished him with attention, awkwardness which did not go both ways, Chris was starting to wonder why he bothered holding himself back. 

"Hey, Chris," she smiled up at him as he approached the forklift, skin glistening. Her bottom lip was being worried between her white teeth at the sight of his work-hardened, huge frame. 

As Chris came around the side of the forklift, he finally got a decent look at what the svelte blond was wearing. Good God. He couldn't help moving in close, towering above as his eyes greedily devoured her. 

Perched provocatively on the forklift, she was a masterpiece of toned, tanned skin, and womanly curves. Her pleated miniskirt was the purest white, contrasting perfectly with the bronze tone of her naturally sun-kissed skin. The way she sat, with one leg up on the seat, exposed skin all the way up to the inside of her lush thighs. Beyond that, her compact ass was clearly visible, directly contacting the well-used, black faux-leather of the forklift's seat. 

Her top was a tiny faded-denim jacket, completely open at the front to reveal the stretchy grey material of her sports bra. Said bra was winning the battle to contain her large breasts, completely covering her chest but leaving no doubt that the slim young woman was absolutely stacked. What it didn't cover was the positively indecent expanse of tummy skin, all the way from her ribs, down to the hem of her clinging skirt, resting low on her hips. 

His eyes were instantly drawn to the teardrop shaped sapphire dangling from a delicate silver arrangement at her belly button. It accentuated her soft muscle tone and pinched waist beautifully. 

Chris realised he was staring and quickly looked up into her blue eyes, a lighter shade than that gemstone but still sparkling with mischief and admiration. Her smile widened and he scrutinised her lightly made-up face. With a casual air, she flicked an errant strand of her cute, razor-cut hair out of her eyes. She'd had it cut short about a month ago, claiming that having it long was too hot in the late alpine summer. Chris thought it made her look even more enchanting. 

"How've you been? What brings you over this side of town?" He tried to be casual as her legs moved, flashing him a glimpse of powder-blue underwear. There was no way it was an accident and his penis twitched dangerously inside his jeans. 

"Oh, you know. I was at the gym in the Compound working out and I just thought I'd drop by and make sure you hadn't forgotten about tonight." 

"Of course not, Hailey. We're all looking forward to it. You reminded me on Wednesday, remember?" It was now Friday, two days later, and Chris couldn't help pointing out that he didn't need reminding. Hailey had invited Chris and his partners to her friend's twenty first birthday at The Cauldron. 

"Yes, but I wanted to see you all sweaty again." She hopped up off the forklift quickly, her spritely body coming to a halt mere inches in front of him, face upturned as she watched for his reaction. 

"Hailey," he cautioned, as her hand reached out to trace the sweaty dimple between his bared abdominal muscles. 

"What?" she said innocently as her simple touch sent a shiver or arousal up his spine. 

He didn't have a response. 

"You know, Chris, it does terrible things to a girl's self-confidence when she gets friend-zoned by the dragon she likes." 

He sighed. 

"Hailey, I'm in a strange love pentagon with four other women. No wait, make that five. A god damn love hexagon. I really do like you but I'm not sure it's right for us to get involved." Chris was wondering where he got the willpower to say these words while her perfect body was so dangerously close. 

She snickered cutely at him, as if his reasoning was completely irrelevant. 

"I know all about that, Chris. Goodness knows it's all over Maginet. I don't want to pull you away from them... I want in." She glanced over to the stairwell guiltily and took her hand off his six-pack. "I should go. Let's talk about it more tonight." 

With that she turned and strutted off towards her electric compact, which she'd parked just inside the warehouse. 

The definition of her legs haunted him all the way until she hopped into her car with a little wave. He was left staring dumbly as she made her exit until Stephen popped his head up from the stairway. 

"That's some self-control you've got, Kid," He laughed at the young man's tortured features. "If a girl did that to me when I was your age... Hell! If a girl did that to me now!" 

Chris nearly jumped out of his skin before his face blushed. However he tried, he couldn't help being embarrassed when she behaved like that with him in front of her father. 

"Christ man, that's your own daughter," he tried appealing to Stephen's fatherly instinct. 

"I know," the werebison chuckled, seeming to find great humour in the situation. "It's torture at home. All I hear is Chris this and Chris that. And that's before she teams up with the wife! The girl needs to get laid, you'd be doing me a favour." 

Chris could only shake his head in disgust. 

"Hey, cheer up, it's not like she's hideous! Anyway, I need a hand with a few enchantments before we finish for the day." Stephen clapped a heavy hand on Chris' back in a show of male solidarity. 

They quickly unloaded the sacks together before heading back downstairs. 

"We're making great progress, Chris. I knew having you help out would make it easier but I can't tell you how much your input has made the difference," the werebison gesticulated across the huge expanse of the soon-to-be living room. 

"Really? I feel more like a human wheelbarrow," Chris answered, only partly sarcastic. 

Stephen looked at him askance before delivering a playful blow to his shoulder. 

"You know it's more than that, Chris! I've never seen rock disappear like you and the terrible trio make it happen. Heck, it's only taken you just over a week to cut out that hallway, the nursery, a bathroom, and almost four large bedrooms. It's nothing to scoff at. It never could have happened if you hadn't been carting the rock and feeding the furnace so to speak. Those goblins are gonna be spoiled by the time this is over. I've never heard of a job where there's unlimited magic refills to keep you going all day. Hell, I'm going to be spoiled!" 

"Well, I'm afraid it's not going to last forever, Stephen. Come Monday, you'll be on your own three days a week." 

"You'll be missed, for sure, but I've come up with a solution to keep us all topped off while you're gone. Besides, we won't need your help as much soon and the boys are eager to stay on to completion. Before you know it, you'll be moving in." 

"Imagine that," Chris let out a tired, wistful sigh. 

"You'll have damn well earned it, too," Stephen said as they rounded the corner onto the diamond room. 

Chris instantly noticed that the glass cover-stone was removed, sitting up on a protective sheet of cloth. There was a small pile of crushed rock to the side of the ring and a corresponding hole had been dug right in the centre of inlaid burnished circle. 

"What's going in there?" Chris asked. 

"Well, I had sort of wanted to keep this a surprise until a bit later. I've got a house warming present for you," Stephen admitted with a huge smile on his face. "You know me though, practicality comes first and we could really use it while you're away." 

"Use what? Stephen, you don't have to get me a gift," Chris felt a little uncomfortable with the idea. Stephen was the one doing him a favour by taking on this huge job. 

"Yeah but I wanted to. Hold on just a moment, I'll go get it." With that, the werebison disappeared off down a hallway and popped into the darkness of one of the excavated bedrooms. 

He emerged moments later, a rough grey ovoid nestled in the crook of his arm and a large plastic bag in the other. The thing was a foot and a half long and just over half a foot wide, tapering at both ends, one of which looked like it had been cut clean off. 

"What is that thing? Some sort of weird egg?" Chris asked warily. He would have wondered if it wasn't a dragon's egg if he didn't know better, the thing looked like it was made of stone. 

"No, no," Stephen chuckled. "Nothing like that. It's a magic well, or it's going to be. I read about them in an old book on castles. Back in the day, they used to use 'em to power the magical defences on all the best keeps and fortresses. Of course, no one bothers nowadays, too hard to fill them up. That's where you come in." 

He handed Chris the magic well, who accepted it with all the tenderness deserving of an unknown magical artefact. As he rolled it over, it became clear that it was indeed made of rock. It was heavy but not as heavy as he felt it should have been. When he examined the flat, cut end, it was instantly obvious what it truly was. 

"It's a geode, a huge one!" Chris exclaimed, peering into the hollow centre and marvelling at the kaleidoscope of small, dark purple crystals that lined the entirety of the hollow centre. 

"Yup, I had it enchanted by a friend of mine to make it more efficient at holding energy. We're gonna pack the sides of the hole with copper wool when we install it, too." He shook the plastic bag as he sunk to his knees next to magic circle. 

"Stephen, you shouldn't have. This must have been expensive," Chris protested as he played the geode this way and that, watching the light being captured and rebounded by the array of crystals inside. 

"Surprisingly, not really. I actually picked it up from a human store, they had a whole bunch of them but I thought this one was the best. Besides, you're paying me well enough." 

"Well, thanks, I appreciate it," Chris said graciously as Stephen got down to splitting open the industrial looking bag of reddish-brown fibres. 

"You're welcome, Chris. I can honestly say I haven't enjoyed working with someone as much as I have with you in a long time," Stephen began stuffing bundles of the metal fibre down into the hole, making a nest for the big geode. "Would you believe that this stuff was harder to get a hold of than that geode? Had to come all the way from China. This country is going to crap." 

Chris couldn't help smiling at werebison's admission. 

"Thanks, Stephen. I've enjoyed working with you, too. Even if I do hate hauling rocks." 

They were silent a few moments as Stephen finished packing the hole. He motioned for Chris to pass over the geode and soon enough it was nestled comfortably in place. More packing was added, surrounding the outside so that it couldn't move and only the large internal cavity was visible. The brim of the geode was right in line with where the glass cover slip would sit when it was replaced. 

Stephen took chalk from the ever-present pouch on his belt and began scribbling around the edge of the hole. He muttered a few incantations under his breath and Chris watched a small surge of energy pulse through his hands into the copper wool. 

"That'll insulate the vessel, both from leaking and from external forces. You're gonna' need that once we put in the concealed flight path for you and the dragonesses," he explained. "Go ahead when you're ready, Chris, try putting some energy in there." 

"Okay, here goes," Chris tentatively hovered his hand over the opening, looking down into the beautiful crystal depths. He relaxed his almost subconscious efforts at dampening his magic, letting it flow freely through his cells as it swirled up, angry at being contained all day without relief. 

Stephen's skin tingled, responding to the upwelling of magic. He was never going to get used to the sheer power this kid had. You'd almost forget about it, Chris was getting pretty good at bottling it up when he was out in the open but whenever he had to use his power, his aura would come flooding out. The sensation was astonishing, like being warmed by a magical sun. 

The transfer began with a narrow beam of pure energy flickering into existence below Chris' hand. It leapt to the nearest grounding point, the crystal lattice directly below it. The energy pulsed deeper into the geode, finding a vast capacity ready to absorb and contain. Chris smiled, this was exciting. It was working. He concentrated on increasing the energy flow, letting his dragon's predator-born focus guide the energy, blanking his mind to other thoughts and distractions. 

It was unlike filling a small to medium sized crystal or gemstone. He was used to that. This was so much bigger. 

Mind you, in the dragon's household it was Claire, Petra, and Susan who bore the brunt of 'crystal duty.' Chris' routine invariably involved one or more of the three women first thing in the morning. They would make love and he would fill his lover to overflowing and beyond with his essence. She then had to battle against the exhaustion and pleasure to catalyse his excess magic down into a gemstone or trinket. 

It was an incredibly satisfying way to start the day and Chris was becoming almost religious about it. They were also turning a tidy profit as Susan would sell the full vessels at her apothecary shop. They were running out the door like hot-cakes and drawing more business to the apothecary in general. 

Chris cut off the flow into the geode when he felt the first hint of tiredness. Lillian's instructions were clear on that subject. Despite his wonderful capabilities, she would skin him slowly over an open fire if she ever sensed he was recklessly pushing boundaries. Now that she wasn't following him twenty-four seven, he needed to be prepared and able to defend himself at any time. There was always that temptation to test his limits but the thought of being rendered down to dragon-broth was a good deterrent. 

Both men leaned over to get a look down into the magic well, their faces illuminated by the purple radiance shining from within. 

"Woah," Chris murmured, watching the small, shimmering pool maybe an inch deep in the bottom of geode. "I didn't think it was going to form a liquid." 

"That's what allows it to store so much magic," Stephen explained. "The crystal not only absorbs the energy but creates a stable container, meaning you can fill the inside with incredibly dense magic." 

"Cool." Ever fascinated with the new concepts and experiences thrown at him, Chris couldn't hide his sense of wonder. 

"You're darn right it's cool!" Stephen enthused as they moved aside and the cover slip was lowered back into position. "That will easily keep us going until you can come back to top it up. I can use this for any more enchantments I need to set up while you're away. Also, it should be easy to link the existing ones into the well, so they draw directly from it. If you keep that thing filled, this house is going to be damn near impenetrable once I'm done." 

"This was a perfect gift, Stephen. Awesome and practical. Thank you." Chris smiled as they stood and began clearing the area of errant copper wool, the small pile of excavated stone, and a couple of plastic bags. 

"Don't mention it, Chris. I've got to make sure my baby girl will be perfectly safe when she's over here," the werebison's grin shone as brightly as the dragon's aura as he watched the kid give him a guilty look. 

Chris rose to his full impressive height, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath through his nose. He let the embarrassment flow out of him until his barrel chest began to shake gently with laughter. That was Stephen for you. There was no use fighting, you just had to go with it. 

*** 

Chris dutifully messaged Lillian on his Maginet phone as he left work at five thirty pm on the dot. Ever since she had started weaning him of her constant guardianship, he was required to report any change of location or status, as well as checking in with her every two hours. The change had come about a month ago. She was satisfied that he had progressed with his combat training to a point that he could defend himself almost as well as she could defend him. 

He missed her, having become used to her constant spectre and sarcastic teasing. Sometimes he sensed her, flickering into the periphery of his awareness during the day, checking up on him. They still saw each other several times a week. The vampire was leading his morning training regime and she sometimes hung around on guard duty at night or if they went out as a group. However, her freed up time was being spent on the Revelation now that he didn't require her constant babysitting. 

There was much to organise on the Being side of things and given her position in Reyla's security team, Lillian was invaluable for the preparations. She was also keeping tabs on the level of dissatisfaction in the broader community. As part of Reyla's "muscle," she also facilitated responses to the rising numbers of issues and discontent amongst the local Beings, be those responses diplomatic or disciplinary. Her age, strength, and the respect she garnered within the Denver vampire community was vital to Reyla's reign. 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Chris said his goodbyes and weekend wishes to Stephen and the goblin brothers as they parted. He walked out onto the gravel yard, waving to the truck driver who was just scooping up the last of the day's crushed rocks. He smiled when he received a friendly salute in return. Rounding the rear corner of the warehouse, he began walking along the side, back towards the street. 

Lillia was on his mind as his feet guided him along his regular short walk to pick up Susan. Work had kept her away too long. 

Over the last two months, there had been several incidents around the globe where Beings became restless or disillusioned with the new restrictions. The memory alteration charm had been used on multiple occasions, forcing the Synod to bring down the full force of their disciplinary power. Other incidents included a mass kidnapping by a vampire coven in New York, a rather high-profile werewolf attack in Germany, a string of ongoing gruesome murder/rapes in Central America, and various suspicious disappearances of both Beings and humans. 

Worse still, the entire Being territory of Indonesia went dark last week. It was thought that the Lord of Jakarta had renounced the Revelation and that it was back to business as usual for Beings there. Feedings, the memory charm, abusing humans, it was all happening again and the Synod was almost powerless to do anything about it. That part of the world was extremely hard for them to infiltrate and, short of a mass invasion, impossible to reign back in. Already, the five-man delegation sent there by the Synod to negotiate was unaccounted for, presumed dead. Most of the information they received now was provided by human operatives. It was not good. 

Lillian said that her kind were especially discontent and the mutterings were getting worse. One of their main pleasures and vices in life had been cut off overnight. The ecstasy of the hunt. The wealthy and powerful were fine of course, having centuries of experience to master their self-control as well as stables of familiars, established before the new restrictions. They could still feed directly from their familiars. Although there had been several cases of familiars seeking asylum from their masters, some had since returned to their old lives now that the issue of their rights was being considered once again. 

It was the young vampires who suffered most and that showed in the number of incidents Lillian responded to. There was enough blood to go around, just, but blood from a box held little lasting satisfaction to the younger vampires who saw delicious meals in every passing human. 

The human governments had recently allowed the incorporation of a legitimate, private blood bank, backed by the vampire council and the Synod. It was an effort to make sure the supply stayed secure and vampires could feed themselves peacefully. Clinics in several major cities were already coming online, offering grocery store credit in reward for blood donations in replica of a food stamp system. The high reward prices were drawing some attention and confusion from the unaware human populous. 

Lillian told him that some vampires and other Beings were so discontented with the situation that they were leaving the hub cities to spread themselves in the less populated areas, making their continued illicit behaviours that much harder to detect and respond to for the territory leaders. 

There had also been several sightings of Beings by humans. One was prominent enough to become an internet sensation and make it onto a breakfast tv show for a brief moment of fame. Thankfully, the shaky images that depicted what appeared to be a flying gargoyle in the early dawn sky had been relegated to hoax status by some quite pressure from the higher up. 

Chris knew it was all one disaster away from blowing up in everyone's faces. 

Throughout it all, no one could tell him squat about Radek. Where was he? What was he up to? There hadn't even been any progress identifying the man, though he suspected Reyla was holding something back from him on that subject. It was frustrating, he got the impression the Synod weren't focusing much effort on tracking him down. Admittedly they had their hands full, but the man was dangerous and being allowed time to regroup. That was stupid. 

If he wasn't so god damn busy all the time, Chris would have been tempted to go off on his own mission to put an end to that stupidity. Between helping with the building, training both physical and magical, four amorous ladies and a growing sprite, and Michelle's evening tutelage there was scant time for anything else. She was coaching him on various systems and procedures he would need to understand in his upcoming role as a 'security consultant.' 

Chris' musings were interrupted as he suddenly found himself outside Susan's workplace. He took a sheepish look around, half expecting Lillian to clip him over the head any moment for inattention to his surroundings. 

The expected punishment was thankfully not forthcoming, so Chris sauntered up the steps to Eddard's Apothecary and slid the tinted glass door aside on quiet rollers. It was a small, unobtrusive building attached to the front of an older warehouse like his own. 

He made sure to duck his head as he entered the dark interior of the storefront. The damn door frame was like a vengeful American-Indian with a tomahawk, a real scalper. 

A quiet tinkle sounded deeper in the warehouse, alerting Susan to his arrival as he took a few moments to appreciate the weirdness of Rowan Eddard's life work. 

Firstly, the place always smelled heavily of incense. That wouldn't have been so bad except that Susan always came home with the scent on her skin and clothes, which Chris' dragon instincts couldn't tolerate. 

You would be forgiven for wondering if the place was closed or left accidentally deserted, for there were no lights on, as always. Only an ancient chandelier holding real candles stood guard above the entrance way but he was yet to see it lit. 

Ancient wooden shelves lined the walls, going all the way to the ceiling with glass jars packed together in no discernible pattern. Most of them were filled with dried, pickled, or tinctured plants, fungi, and insects. There were also the obligatorily grotesque preserved animals scattered around the shelves in their glass tombs. Snakes, rats, octopi, bats, fish, lizards, frogs, and even what he swore was a chihuahua all stared down at him in creepy judgement. 

Display counters took up the centre of the room, topped and fronted with large panes of glass. Susan, or more usually old Rowan, would dispense the more valuable magical items and ingredients stored there when the counter was manned. All sides of the display counter were filled to the brim with trinkets, vials of potion, crystals, sprigs of rare magical plants, charms, samples of pure elements, oils, various powders; the list was unending. There was even a refrigerated section which kept some of the more sensitive potions alive longer. 

Every time he came in here, his eyes were drawn to the web-like structure of ropes which criss-crossed the ceiling just above his head. Perhaps it was because it felt like the bundles of dried plants hanging from them were always skimming his hair. He still wasn't comfortable with his height, and eyed the bundles warily, 6'6'' was just so damn tall. 

His nose guided his attention back down towards the counter which was tastefully decorated with beautiful displays of live indoor plants. Some tiny white blossoms from a mosslike plant were releasing a pleasant scent into the incense-thick air. Susan had quickly established these tasteful additions to the display when she started working. Chris even recognised a few of her beloved Night Heart plants, who's dark red leaves tolerated the permanent low light. 

Perhaps the gloom and eeriness were cultivated on purpose, for if you wanted a cure, potion, remedy, or even something a little more nefarious, you got the impression you were in the right place. 

The growing clacking of high heeled steps had Chris watching the bead-string covered doorway at the rear of the shop. Soon, Susan sauntered into view, flicking her dark hair luxuriously as the beads parted over her body. She greeted her lover with a brilliant smile, rushing over on some impractically tall-heeled black sandals to wrap her arms around him and lean up for a kiss. 

Chris couldn't help admiring the attractive witch. She was aglow with vitality. He'd been feeding magic into her at an alarming rate for over two months now. Despite her initial protestations the results were clear, she looked radiant and somehow a little more youthful. She'd slimmed very slightly, her pale skin vital with health. Her eyes twinkled delightfully as she squeezed him close, and her lips were oh-so sinfully plump and soft as they smashed against his own. 

Not only that, her magical presence was growing. Just last week she'd requalified from class four to a low three. She'd made incredibly passionate love to him that evening, crying out her devotion for him over and over. He couldn't help chuckling at the memory, which broke their kiss. 

He held her tight against him, her dark green, backless sundress a scant barrier as his hands roamed her sides, hungrily taking hold of her plump rear-end. 

"Heels, Mom?" Chris asked, wondering why the usually practical woman would be wearing such potentially dangerous footwear around the store and warehouse. 

"I know, honey. It's silly, right? I just wanted some practice before we all go out this evening. I got these things yesterday but I haven't worn heels like this in years," Susan explained as she ran her hands over his broad shoulders admiringly.  

"I'm not complaining," Chris smiled down at her. "You look gorgeous!" 

"Thanks," Susan beamed as her nose started taking note of his powerfully masculine scent. 

"Are you sniffing me, Susan?" He teased her as she tentatively buried her nose in his chest. 

She blushed, squirming coquettishly in his arms. 

"Maybe," she looked up at him a little guiltily. "Can't a woman appreciate the scent of her hard-working man? Anyway, how was your day?" 

"It was fine," Chris shrugged, still squeezing her against him. "Stephen got me a great gift for the house, I'll tell you about it later. Are you ready to go?" 

Susan bit her bottom lip naughtily with a slight shake of her head. 

"You know how I've been working on a stronger brew for cancelling your pheromones? Well, I thought we might want to take some with us tonight if we're going to The Cauldron," Susan's tongue flicked out across her lips, drawing attention to the freshly applied coating of dark red lipstick. "I'll need a fresh sample to brew with, of course." 

Chris' shit-eating grin was all the response she needed so she tip-toed for a brief peck before freeing herself from his arms. She clacked her way over to lock the front door, before beckoning Chris to follow her through the beaded doorway into the warehouse. 

He followed quickly, unwilling to lose sight of her legs in those heels and the expanse of soft skin her backless dress exposed. They passed through a short hallway with a few store rooms and a bathroom off to the side, then they were out under the lights of the nursery. 

The contrast from the gloomy shop was staggering. Vast arrays of bright lights hung from the ceiling, catering for the needs of the rows upon rows of waist high stainless benches, absolutely covered with potted plants. Susan had moved her personal collection here from Laramie last month, swelling the nursery to capacity. 

The inside of the warehouse was completely insulated against the cold winters and the industrially white walls reflected a lot of the light, making things almost uncomfortably bright. 

Susan turned right and led him over to her spacious pavilion in the corner. It was a sturdy frame of hardwood beams, covered on the sides with flowing black fabric. The roof of the structure was mostly open, to allow steam from her cauldron or experiments to waft into the greater warehouse. It served to provide her some privacy and refuge, a space to relax and practice her magical arts. She often needed that after working for hours on her feet, tending the plants or managing the store. 

She brushed aside the fabric acting as a doorway, giving him a come-hither look over her shoulder before sauntering inside. Chris followed like an excited puppy. 

"Come sit down, honey," she was waiting for him just inside, ready to guide him down into a deep cushion-lined wicker chair. "Do you want a drink before we get started?" 

"Sure. Thanks, Mom," Chris replied, already feeling his eager cock twitch inside his jeans. 

Susan poured him a large glass of lemon water from a pitcher and handed it to him. As he took a big sip, she collected the other items she was going to need before checking on the simmering copper cauldron in the centre of the room. 

The potion was coming along nicely, a light-yellow brew bubbling away happily, and she judged it ready to receive the final, key ingredient. This version did not rely on using silver and was therefore compatible with vampires, theoretically it was also stronger and longer lasting. Susan had been tinkering with the recipe for a while now and this was showing real promise. Her newfound magical strength allowed her to exert her magic over more complex reactions. This unlocked the efficient use of potent and rare ingredients without wasting them. She could now tackle more intricate recipes and pull them off. 

The source of this newfound ability was Chris, she knew it. If she was being honest, she was absolutely besotted with him, drunk from the thrill and power of his gifts, high on the pleasure he tortured her with in the process of feeding her magic. 

She rounded on him with lust in her eyes, her beautiful big boy, her masculine lover, her son in heart if not in flesh. Wasting no time, she grabbed a folded blanket from behind his chair, placing it in front of him on the rug. The large beaker she'd collected earlier was placed within reach on the nearby coffee table as she got down on her knees. She shuffled forwards onto the blanket, running a hand up his muscular thigh as she looked up at him. 

Susan smiled up at him as her hands reached for the button on his jeans, unclasping it and making short work of his zipper too. 

"Lift up, baby. Momma can't wait to feel you spurting again," the sultry witch purred. 

"Oh, Jesus," Chris moaned as he lifted his ass and shuffled his jeans and boxers down to his knees. "Not the Mom-talk again." 

"What?" Susan pouted seductively, eyeing the semi-hard monster now resting against his thigh. "I thought you liked the Mom-talk, honey. Last time you came extra hard." 

"Yeah but you always tease me for ages when you do it," Chris complained half-heartedly as her hands sent tingles up his skin. 

Susan parted his legs, leaning down into his crotch until her painted lips were barely an inch from his awakening cock. Her breath blew cool against his sensitive skin, making him twitch as he hardened further, blood rushing into his enormous phallus. Her eyes darted up to his for a moment and he reached down to run a hand through her silky black hair. 

"Okay baby, I won't tease you this time... much." 

With that, Susan finally closed the distance and wrapped her sultry lips around the tip of his thickening member. He hardened fully in seconds, his angry red cockhead spitting sweet, salty pre-come across her writhing tongue. 

She let out a wanton moan, working her lips firmly back on forth over the sensitive ridge of his cockhead, making him gasp in pleasure as his fist tightened in her hair. More delicious fluids leaked from his pulsing tip as she tried to thrust her tongue into his little slit, the sensation was unbelievable. 

"Oh fuck, you know what you're doing!" Chris cried out, slapping a free hand down on his thigh as she began using both hands to jerk his vein-mottled length at the same time. 

"Mmm, do you like it when I suck on your fat cockhead, Chris? Do you like how I smooch it?" She released him from her mouth, running her wicked tongue up and down his underside and back up to his pulsing tip. A little spurt shot out across her dark red lips and she giggled cutely. "Mmhh, so big and tasty." 

Chris watched in awe as the woman who'd raised him since his parents died paused and used a finger to swipe his fluid into her mouth with obvious relish. She made a real show of licking her finger clean before she arched an eyebrow up at him. 

"Well, young man? Your mother asked you a question." 

The sudden sternness in her voice sent an illicit shiver up his body. Chris, his mind overrun with pleasure and taboo, had to think back to what the question was. 

"Of course, Mom, I fucking love it when you do that thing with your tongue." 

Susan beamed pridefully at him, happy and thrilled at the effect she had on him, on them both really. Her hands began moving on his thick shaft again, slicker now from her saliva and his copious pre-come. She couldn't get enough of him, his scent, his taste, his magic, his love. 

"Good boy. Now just relax. I'm going to show you just how much I love you and your wonderful cock, honey." 

With that, Susan wasted no time wrapping her full lips around his helmet again, pausing momentarily to take a breath through her nose before pushing deeper. 

Chris knew exactly what was coming but it didn't prepare him. Her lips just kept on enveloping his steel-hard erection. He felt his sensitive cockhead push past her tonsils and enter her tight, hot throat. The sensation was exquisite, felt his heavy balls tensing in preparation to shoot already and had to focus on maintaining control. The beautiful, full bodied witch just took him deeper and deeper, looking up into his eyes with the strained curl of a smile at the corners of her mouth. 

"Thank fuck for magic!" he groaned, feeling thick spittle leaking from her lips, smoothing the way for the magic-assisted sword swallowing act of the century. 

Susan almost choked on his mighty tool as she tried not to laugh. He was so goofy and looked so adorable when he was trying not to come too fast. She regained control and continued her decent, feeling his massive girth tremble and pulse in need, firing slippery pre-come directly down her gullet. 

It shouldn't have been possible but finally her nose came up against his crotch, her lips straining around the thick root of his cock. She held there for a moment as he throbbed, so hot and hard inside her before the desire to breathe won out and she pulled her head quickly up and off the monster. 

Susan gasped for breath, loving the adoration on his face. Her hands instantly began a firm, slippery jerking all the way from his raging tip to the sturdy base of his rampaging cock. 

"Don't hold back honey-bunny, I want that sweet cum," she whispered huskily. 

Chris let out a soft moan and shut his eyes as she swallowed him down once again and began a practiced, short stroke on about two thirds of his dick. She knew exactly how to bring him to the brink now. They'd had a lot of practice. 

It hadn't taken long for Susan to demand he use his magic on her vagina as he had with Annabel. They were soon back to fucking like spring rabbits. Susan found she got a huge thrill from his new size and virility. She loved her ability to accommodate him, especially when he jetted his sperm directly into her womb. It was during this time she also discovered a little kink of her own, that she loved playing on the taboo aspect of their relationship. She never would have thought so, but it gave her such a thrill to tease him, to play on their previous relationship as mother and son. She was pretty sure he loved it, too.

--------------------------------------------
The only thing that wasn't perfect was that she couldn't easily provide him oral pleasure. It had been their naughty treat after that fateful incident on the flight back from the UK, something special between them. 

It was only a matter of days before she hatched a plan and had him work his magic again, this time on her mouth and throat, transforming her into a world class cocksucking champion. That she could now take his huge dragon cock to the very last inch was testament to the potency of his magic. 

Susan slurped greedily as his crest began to rise and pre-come practically gushed from his tip. She pulled back until just his enormous crown occupied her mouth, spitting tasty fluid across her teeth and tongue. She could see his face scrunch up and feel him thicken to diamond-cutting hardness. 

She moaned in anticipation as her tongue batted his slit and her lips sucked heavily against his sensitive ridge. He swelled thicker in her grip, harder. One hand jerked him slowly, feeling the first spasm of climax race up his shaft, the other reached back to collect the huge glass beaker. She had to grope around momentarily to find it as the first blast of thick, white semen rocketed against the back of her mouth. 

Susan swallowed greedily, he had more to give than she need for her potion. His magic raced through her body, sparking fires of pleasure and satisfaction in moments. She cried out in husky pleasure, releasing his squirting shaft to fire a massive pearly salvo across her cheek and into her dark hair. Her hand took a firm grip at his root and wrenched him downwards until his hugely inflamed helmet met the cold glass of the beaker, ready to collect his precious load. 

She laughed delightedly, feeling the huge ropes of magic-rich spunk race up his shaft into the rapidly filling receptacle. It was so exciting to watch and feel his huge erection spit angrily, jettisoning enough sperm to impregnate her a billion times over. The thought made her whimper as his sharp little magical climax quieted its headlong race through her body. Her drenched womanhood began to relax its sympathetic squeezing, instead feeling hot, empty, and demanding. 

It didn't take an expert potion-master's eye to know she'd collected enough, the beaker was nearly full. He must have given her almost a pint and he was still spewing his pearly, prodigious load as she performed a well-timed swap, her mouth wrapping hungrily around his tip again. She couldn't help noticing he was ejaculating more and more these days. Perhaps he was adapting and growing to meet the needs of his hungry brood as they became receptive to absorbing his magic. 

Chris' eyes shot open at the return of the warm sensation of her lips. He looked on approvingly as she swallowed down his last few spurts, his hand still stroking through her hair. Her look of pure love as she performed this almost worship-like act spurred his passions anew. 

She squealed delightedly as he pulled her off of his penis and rode her down onto the rug. She barely had time to place the now heavy beaker back on the coffee table before he was upon her, lips demanding. 

She kissed him back, slipping her tongue deep into his mouth as she felt him pulling impatiently at her dress. 

They broke the kiss as he gave up on getting her dress off and instead focused on getting his restricting jeans down to his ankles and off in a desperate struggle. 

Susan laughed at his impatience. He clearly couldn't wait to be inside her and she saw no reason to postpone their coupling either. She spread her legs in anticipation, pulling her dress up onto her tummy as he squirmed around on top of her, his massive dick flailing around wildly between her thighs. 

Finally, he freed one of his legs and that was good enough. He gripped her thigh roughly and spread her further, making her gasp. His hot knob butted against the slick gusset of her rather practical underwear. He pulled those roughly aside too, exposing her engorged vagina, her forest of soft, dark, pubic hair slicked down with her own thick, leaking lubricant. 

His enormous head split her easily, sliding quickly into her gushing quim. They groaned in unison, eyes meeting again as they both felt the wonderful heat and instinctual satisfaction of their mating. 

Susan's back arched upwards, thrusting her heaving breasts into him as his great spear conquered her once more. It sank deeper and deeper in one measured thrust until he bumped her cervix in just the way she'd grown to love. She let out a pleasured yip as he ground his fat cock around inside her, stirring her sensitive tissues expertly. Then she had to hold onto his broad shoulders for dear life as he suddenly reared back and began fucking her with powerful strokes. 

Chris yelled triumphantly above her, revelling in the pleasure of the fuck. His cock bathed in the heat of her quivering, greasy, molten-hot pussy. He wasn't holding back. His hips slapped against the back of her thighs as he pushed her legs higher, folding the beautiful witch up into a mewling, sweaty, ball of sex and hammering her mature cunt with as much as she could take. 

It was a thing of beauty, the lust and passion of their coupling, their cries of ecstasy. 

Susan was absolutely soaking, he loved that about her. Even before the enchantment, she would always be wet and ready for him at the drop of a hat. If she was tired or overloaded with magic, she would still roll over and accept his youthful, loving attention and let him fuck her rotten. This time was no different. As they fucked, her thick pussy cream and his own precum worked into a oily white lather, paving the way for his plundering erection. Despite his size, their overflowing lubrication allowed for an easy, wonderful glide in and out of her squeezing channel. 

His cock was singing its joy to the rest of his sweaty body, butting her fleshy cervix at every opportunity and barely skimming her sensitive clitoris when he angled his thrusts just right. He could tell she was close too by the way she squirmed in his grip, attempting to raise her hips and meet the powerful thrusts of his over-sized dick. Her strained, puffy labia gripped him each time he pulled out, reluctant to release him, yet resisting his entry so delightfully each time he thrust back in. 

"Oh god! Chris... I... ahh... hhaaa... fucking... love this!" She screamed against his cheek, great gasps of air being sucked into her lungs to fuel her lush body's pleasure. 

Every exquisite thrust was announced with an excited cry from his gorgeous mother as her climax grew rapidly inside her core. He smiled down at her in masculine pride as they fucked. There was something incredibly satisfying about knowing he was the pinnacle of her sexual experience. That he alone could take her to such heights of pleasure, that other men would pale in comparison to him both in size and in giving her the pleasure, the magic she deserved. This was being a dragon. Fucking his mate, providing for her, protecting her, breeding her. 

That thought was what finally pushed him over the edge. His whole body tensed as cum raced up his mighty shaft once more, straight into her hungry depths. 

Susan wailed happily as the scalding seed shot forcefully against her cervix, plastering it white as she felt more and more of his thick cum jet into her well-fucked love-tunnel. It was hot, blooming deep inside, making her hips writhe as she shook her head back and forth in pleasured disbelief. Her orgasm crested instantly, barely needing the help of his potent magic to have her shuddering beneath him. Her legs escaped his grasp as they thrashed in pleasure, her back arching, toes curling. 

She felt him reposition, his huge cock-knob rocking forcefully into her cervix, parting her just a little. Susan couldn't fathom how he managed that feat with unnerving accuracy but cried out her encouragement nonetheless. His precious seed, shot through the eye of the needle, burst forth directly into her womb. Paroxysms of pleasure renewed as her womanhood clamped down hard on the thick invader. Her labia strained, unable to encircle last few inches of his massive cock-root, almost pinching at him as he pumped her so full of baby batter that it began spewing back out around their coupling. 

The last of her air left her lungs in a whispering groan of tortured overload, her abdomen shuddering rhythmically as he fired the last of his life-giving sperm into her most sacred depths. 

It was then, his cum pooling deep inside her, that he brushed his lips ever so lightly against her ear. Their panting breath was warm against each other, their sweaty faces radiating heat. He kissed her neck, such a tender gesture, and whispered to her so hopefully. 

"One day soon we'll make a child together, Mom." 

Susan could only shiver silently and cling to him, a strained gasp on her face as his illicit words detonated another orgasmic bomb inside her. Nothing would please her more, he'd played her like a fiddle. 

*** 

Half an hour later, when they finally managed to rouse themselves from post-coital cuddling, they realised they were going to be late. 

There was a potion to make, slick genitals to clean, clothes to straighten, hair to brush, sex stains to dab at, and smeared lipstick to track down. 

Susan hovered over her cauldron, stirring madly in a precise order of clock and counter-clock strokes. His thick, sticky seed clung annoyingly to the beaker as she upended it, before rushing in with a lewd glug. The surface of the liquid quit its happy simmering and began to boil furiously. The witch frowned intently. A dangerous froth rose up towards her like an unattended pot of pasta. She doubled down on the stirring, her ancient stone ladle sloshing in the pool of golden liquid at the bottom. 

The froth rose almost to the brim of the cauldron, making Susan doubt her abilities momentarily. It held steady for a few moments as Chris eyed the imminent catastrophe warily over her shoulder. Unfinished or poorly brewed potions were notorious for their weird and sometimes destructive effects. Finally, the bubbling subsided and the foam began to recede. Soon enough, a now pale purple fluid was revealed. 

Susan sighed in relief but her attention was drawn back to the cum-smeared beaker in her hand. It would be a travesty to let any of his essence go to waste. That she had access to Chris as a source at all would have all the Salem grand families green with envy. 

A spatula was soon produced, rounding up the errant globs of his cooling semen and driving them out over the lip of the beaker to splash into the cauldron. They produced a small amount of bubbling, easily managed this time. As she stirred, Susan savoured the tasty treat of licking the spatula with apparent enjoyment. 

Chris' ever excitable cock twitched dangerously at the obscene sight. 

"Jesus, Mom, you'd better stop that right now if we're going to get out of here. We're already running late." 

Susan smirked, making a performance of running her tongue along the red silicone of the kitchen implement, collecting the last of his delicious, spicy essence. She giggled happily as he let out an exasperated sigh. 

"I'm sorry, dear." She wasn't. "I just can't let any go to waste." 

"Well, do you have to be so sexy about it? Annabel's going to strangle me as it is and we still have to walk back to the apartment." 

They were thankfully quick to finish their preparations to leave. Susan turned off the gas burner under the cauldron and ladled out a small vial full of the new pheromone cancellation potion. Her trusty label maker soon printed out a little sticker to label it PCP. Chris couldn't help laughing at her bemused expression when he explained that wasn't exactly an appropriate acronym to carry around. Especially seeing as they were going out to a club this evening and the potion would be put through its paces. 

Susan spared a moment to reapply her lipstick in the mirror, she'd look positively indecent otherwise. The heels came off too and into a carry bag, replaced with her more practical, comfy white and pink sneakers for the walk home. Then she collected her ever present huge leather purse and led her impatient dragon back out into the warehouse. 

The systems governing the lights, temperature, and water for the plants were fully automated but she spared thirty seconds to make sure everything was set up properly for the weekend. She locked up, set the alarm, and they started walking hurriedly back towards the Being district, hand in hand. 

Chris and Susan chatted amiably about this and that, smiling dreamily at each other as they walked. Sure, they were going to be late but there had been a damn pleasurable reason for it. 

He loved these times with Susan as they walked home after work and was going to miss them once their new house was built. They'd grown ever closer as the weeks passed, cementing their relationship as lovers, discussing plans. 

He was finding it was important to devote some part of every day to each of his lovely partners. It didn't matter if it was just five minutes spent cuddling on the sofa or two hours of soulful conversation as they strolled a park on the weekend. Every one of his beautiful ladies received his undivided attention and love at some point in the day. If for some reason they didn't, he would make it up to them. 

Their strange family was falling easily into the brood dynamic. There was an unofficial roster for his evenings, involving bedding at least one of his broodmates. He still slept most week nights with Annabel so that undoubtedly led to a repeat performance once he returned to her bed. Then in the mornings, he would get up at the crack of dawn, shake the sleep from his mind, and track down either the witch or one of the two dragonesses to screw. They would fuck, filling as many magical vesicles as time and their tired bodies allowed before the rest of the day started at seven am. 

Perhaps the most unexpected factor of the equation was Immi. The rambunctious sprite was growing at a steady but alarming rate thanks to his enchantment. Already she was just over two and a half feet tall, more than doubling her size in two months. The unexpected part was how she'd managed to insert herself into his relationship with Annabel. The sprite slept with them every night and regularly joined in their lovemaking. It was becoming common for her to accompany Annabel during the day too, adopting various disguises or simply staying close by in the Ether. 

Immi's growing size, unrealistic beauty, and playful submissiveness were a constant strain on his desire. Chris could not wait for the day that he sunk his throbbing cock into that little blue minx. Her still diminutive size didn't stop her participating as he and Annabel made love though. Her small blue hands could tease, grope, pinch, slap, and fondle perfectly well. She had an unashamed obsession with his cum, guzzling it down in unbelievable quantities at every chance she got, including slurping it happily from Annabel's depths. She was convinced it was fuelling her growth and Chris had to agree with her. 

Annabel's sapphic awakening had taken him by surprise though. He'd walked in on her lapping away at the sprite's tiny, delicious pussy one day. The two of them hadn't offered him any explanation. His dragon tendencies accepted that readily enough, especially when he'd mounted Annabel and found her already glistening and ripe for sex. 

He should have expected it really. Immi's girl-cum, whilst delicious, was a potent aphrodisiac and euphoric, bordering narcotic. He knew from personal experience. Annabel was exposed during that first encounter the three of them had shared on the couch months ago after Reyla had shot at him with a shadefrost spell. He suspected the rest was inevitable after that seed had been planted. He knew Annabel's feelings for him hadn't changed, she was growing some new ones for the sprite, just as he was. 

He couldn't deny the erotic sight of them together. Kissing, play fighting, competing for his attention; it was all a well-rehearsed act to get an inevitable rise out of him. He did wonder if their relationship would change once Immi was large enough to have sex with him. Though the thought of Immi and Annabel entwined in lust as he took turns pleasuring them was a haunting fantasy. Some nights he would wake abruptly, only to find Immi's lithe little body wrapped around his cock, searching for a midnight snack. 

He shook his head in capitulation, wrapping his arm around Susan and squeezing her against his side. He was a dragon, not a human. Sexual mores were hard to overcome though. He still felt guilty or embarrassed sometimes if one of his ladies caught him fooling around with another brood member or ogling an attractive woman on the street. He wondered it that would ever change, they certainly teased him enough about it. 

This line of thought brought him back to the looming issue of Hailey Sibon. While his dragon instinct told him to bed the beautiful young heifer forthwith, he had to question his own sanity. He had five amorous ladies to contend with already. What the hell was he thinking? What was he going to do tonight when his broodmates would surely sense the tension between them? 

"Mom, I don't know what to do about Hailey," he stated bluntly, as if that was all the information she was going to need to dissect his tangled feelings. 

Susan smiled, happy that he had come to her with this. From the way his body tensed as he spoke, she could tell he was worked up about it. 

"Well, that depends, dear. I assume you like her, otherwise there wouldn't be an issue?" She asked. 

"Yeah," Chris admitted. "I do, but..." 

"But what?" 

"Jees, Mom, I don't know... It's like I feel guilty when I'm talking to her. Like I'm being unfaithful." 

Susan squeezed his hand reassuringly. 

"That's very touching, Chris. I know it must be difficult for you to come to grips with your nature. You should do what feels right to your dragon. I'm not saying you should go around humping everything like an excited puppy, but it is natural for you to possess a... gosh I hesitate to say it." 

"What, Mom?" 

"A harem, dear," Susan sighed. "Your brood is a harem. I can't tell you there's a cap on the number of women you should or shouldn't be involved with. I would appreciate it if you keep it to a dull roar though, I want to be able to spend at least some time with you." 

"I'll always have time for you, Susan." He squeezed her tighter again as they rounded the final corner, the hotel lobby coming into view half a block away. 

"Thank you, honey. As far as I'm concerned, you can investigate bringing Hailey in on our relationship if that's what you both want. What's important is that everyone is content with the dynamic; that feelings don't get hurt. Perhaps you should take it slowly with Hailey, hang out with her or go on a date. You know, regular stuff. You also need to introduce her to the others and make sure they're okay. I know Annabel and I have met her once or twice but Claire, Petra, and Immianthe haven't. Tonight will be a perfect opportunity to make a start." 

"Thanks, Mom. I guess that sort of helps." 

"There's also the practical aspect to think about. If your current track record is anything to go by, you are going to have a lot of crawling, crying, drooling, puking, and pooping little miracles to look after. You're going to be a father, young man. It will change you, put a lot of demands on your time, energy, and sanity. Not to mention your wallet! 

I know we've barely talked about it outside of the bedroom but I do want children with you someday, Chris, all of us do. You need to consider your responsibilities to us, your broodmates, as well as your future children. It's a big deal and I suspect you won't fully understand it until you're holding your firstborn in your arms." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
Chris stopped walking, they were at the base of the steps leading up to the hotel. He turned to Susan and took her gently by the shoulders, trying to convey his feelings. 

"I know it's a big deal, Mom, and maybe you're right. It will be hard to understand until Claire gives birth but I'm committed one hundred percent. Susan, when we have kids I will make sure they have the best start in life I possibly can. Working on this house of ours is only the beginning, I'm going to make the entire world a better place for them." 

Susan's vision was blurring with happy moisture when he finished. She reached up and flung her arms around his neck, holding tight. The strength of her reaction took both of them by surprise, but she recovered quickly and gave him a passionate kiss. 

"It's a good thing we're in public or your pants would be coming straight off, mister," her sultry tone and the heat of her kiss left no doubt she was being serious. "I just know you're going to be a great father, Chris. I raised you after all. Okay, let's get going before I do something that will get us arrested. It gets me so damn hot when you talk about having a family." 

*** 

Michelle watched in amusement as Annabel's soft leather boot tapped impatiently on the dark wooden floor. The little tassels of brown calf-skin flapped just below her knee where the top of the cowgirl boots ended against her pale skin. 

Annabel's outfit was supposed to match with Chris' but if he didn't show up soon and get ready in record time, Michelle wondered if Annabel had the nerve to leave without him. 

She had to admit, Annabel did look very pretty. Any male in their right mind certainly wouldn't want to make her wait looking like this. Scantily clad only barely applied. Between the boots, a tiny pair of jean shorts, and a red and black checkered tie-off crop top, everything else was beautiful pale skin. The light-coloured Stenson hat and huge silver hoops in her ears completed the look perfectly and Michelle wondered if the Annabel of two months ago would have dared to pull off such an outfit. 

Michelle glanced around the room self-consciously. She was certainly the most conservatively dressed of the assembled ladies. She wasn't sure what you were supposed to wear to a Being club and had chosen a simple navy cocktail dress she used to wear to the various functions her professional life took her to. She didn't have much else. The sexiest part of her outfit was probably her grey stockings and matching pumps. 

Everyone else seemed to be going with the 'less is more' philosophy. Lillian looked like a walking wet dream in a slinky red silk dress. It was a stretch to say it went down to mid thigh and the succulent cleavage exposed on her chest was bound to cause men to drool, especially as it was obvious she wasn't wearing a bra. Her rich brown hair flowed luxuriously around her shoulders in beautiful waves, framing her refined features and suggestive makeup. 

Lillian was supposed to be on duty tonight but clearly, she planned on enjoying herself, too. 

The two dragonesses were over on the couch, engrossed in their tablets. Both wore matching charcoal grey crop tops but the material was very elastic, and long sleeved, too. The overall effect was quite revealing as it clung to their curvy bodies and exposed most of their tummies. If you looked closely, you could just tell that the proud mothers were beginning to show by the tiny bulges low on their bellies. Below that, they both wore short skirts. 

Petra's was a lovely blue and green tartan, pleated all the way around. It looked great against her black stockings. Claire, however, was a little more daring than her mother and wore a form fitting white number that looked like it was made from some sort of leather. It had several slits cut into the material for ease of movement, exposing even more flesh. Her toned legs were on full display, a lovely light tan graced her skin and offset her scarlet hair wonderfully. 

Chris was surely in for a treat tonight. 

Michelle looked up as Annabel let out an exasperated grunt. 

"I'm going to call him," she announced. 

Lillian cocked her head, listening with for a moment. 

"Don't bother, they've just gotten off the elevator." 

"About fucking time!" Annabel complained. "The invitation said to be there by seven thirty for dinner, that's in ten minutes." 

"Surely you're heard of being fashionably late?" Lillian poked. 

Annabel only muttered something and glowered at the doorway, knowing by now that the vampire was just trying to get a rise out of her. 

The key card reader bleeped happily and Chris was bustled inside with Susan bringing up the rear. The culpable looks on their faces told everyone in the room exactly why they were running late. 

"I should have known," Annabel shook her head in surrender. 

"I'm sorry, dear," Susan patted the younger woman's shoulder affectionately. "If it's any consolation, I've brewed up a stronger batch of the pheromone cancellation potion. It might be useful tonight if you want to take him out on the dance floor." 

"It's fine, Susan," Annabel sighed before looking at Chris. "You. Shower. Right now." 

"Yes, Ma'am," he came to attention and snapped out a crisp salute, making Michelle and Lillian chuckle. 

Annabel started forwards with retribution in her eyes, so Chris quickly hurried away toward the bedroom. He wasn't expecting to receive a playful swat to his rear-end from his fiancé and let out a startled yelp when it connected, sparking another round of laughter. 

As he passed close to Michelle, he paused, looking her up and down. He'd never seen her put so much effort into her appearance before. The ever-practical NSA agent usually liked to blend in as much as possible. 

"You look lovely, Michelle. I'm really glad you decided to come along tonight." 

It was true, her navy-blue dress looked fantastic on her athletic figure. Her short black hair was up in a bun with two decorative sticks holding it in place. Her makeup looked great, eyeshadow and mascara giving her a provocative, almost come-hither look. 

"Thanks, Chris. I thought this could also be an opportunity to celebrate you finally coming to work with me at the BIA. It's been two months in the making and I know you've been struggling through your training modules. All that effort is about to pay off." 

"Sure, I'm sort of looking forward to it actually. And not just because it means I won't be breaking my back at the warehouse five days a week. I'm excited to see what you have in store for me," Chris explained, glanced over his shoulder towards Annabel. "Anyway, I'm already skating on thin ice so I'd better go jump in the shower." 

He was waylaid again in the bedroom, finding his little sprite twirling on top of Annabel's dresser, admiring her own reflection in the big mirror. She chirped excitedly when she noticed him, flapping over on her batlike blue wings to cling around his neck, her feet now dangling down just past his bellybutton. 

"Oh, Master! Do you like my new dress? Annabel picked it up for me today and it's just perfect!" She gazed up at him adoringly. 

"You do look beautiful, Immi. Does this mean you've finally decided to start wearing clothes?" Chris asked. 

The tiny black garment in question was a custom number that Annabel had commissioned for this very occasion. She'd had it made in the style of the original slinky black silk dress Chris had bought for her and paid for in dragon gold. Mary was only too pleased to take on such a unique request, especially on behalf of the dragon. It was like designing a sexy doll's costume. 

"I don't want to wear them unless I have to. Mistress says that I won't be able to get away with it much longer. She says I'm getting too big and too distracting," a cute frown crossed her brow. 

"Well, I think she's probably right, little one. You don't see any full-sized women strutting around with assets like yours, do you?" 

"No," she meeped. 

"Hey, cheer up. We're going out tonight!" He reached up to cup her juicy little bum, taking the weight off her arms. If her current form was anything to go by, Immi was going to have an ass to seriously rival Annabel's. Her wings settled delicately as he held her up and gave her a quick kiss. "There's gonna' be food, new people to meet, drinks, and dancing. You'll love it. Besides, if you're well behaved, I promise that when we get back, you can strip down to nothing again. You can even have your favourite." 

"My favourite!" she suddenly cheered up. Her innocent joy at the prospect did terribly arousing things to his dragon's brain. "You promise?" 

"I promise, my dirty little piglet," Chris couldn't help smiling at the nasty thought. 

"None for Mistress?" Immi questioned accusingly. 

"Well, last time you couldn't handle it all yourself, Immi," Chris teased her. "Annabel was just trying to help out. She shares with you all the time." 

"No! You promised. This time it's mine! I want to feel the whole lot shooting up inside me! I don't care if there's too much, I want it to look like I'm about to spawn. All. Mine!" The greedy sprite demanded, her little talons starting to extend in anticipation and prick against his skin. 

"Okay, okay," Chris chuckled at the wound-up, pint-sized little succubi. The claws did tend to come out when his semen was involved. 

Time was on his side now. It was only a matter of months before he would have his way with the rambunctious, long-eared, little devil-woman. If anything, he would have to be the one to show restraint. Immi was bound to insist they fuck before she had truly grown enough. 

"I don't hear the shower!" Annabel shouted from the living room, startling Chris from his sexy debaucheries. 

"I've been a little bit bad, she does hate being late," Chris explained as he deposited Immi back on the dresser and stripped hurriedly out of his clothes. 

He had the quickest shower in history, not even bothering to let the water warm up before he jumped in and began lathering up. It was especially good to clean his groin, Susan's fluids and his own still clung to his skin in a fragrant, sticky residue. It wouldn't be very polite to show up like that to a party where any number of Beings would have enhanced senses of smell, especially Hailey. 

His clothes were dutifully laid out on the bed. A skin hugging pair of black jeans, chestnut brown boots with slightly pointed toes, and a cotton shirt of the lightest blue, almost white. He ran a hand through his still damp hair whilst looking in the mirror. He gave up on any attempt to coax the short, blond mop into any sort of order after a few moments. It would just have to do. 

It turned out that he could have taken his time in the shower. Susan took a fair while longer to emerge from her bedroom than he did, clad in a sensuous, flowing teal dress that accentuated her figure wonderfully. The deep v of soft cleavage left uncovered by the garment had Chris reliving the frantic rut they'd shared just an hour ago. 

All the ladies looked radiant. His eyes were spoiled for choice, though they tended to be drawn back to Lillian's Amazonian perfection again and again. It was a rare treat to see her dressed to impress and in red, Chris couldn't help drawing a comparison to a buxom cartoon character. She certainly had the figure and effortless sexuality down-pat. It might take a little bit of liquid courage but he was going to have to ask her to dance tonight. 

Chris glanced at his phone when they were all ready to go. Only twenty minutes late, that wasn't too bad. Annabel at least had been mollified by a stint sitting in his lap; soft kissed apologies, tender petting, and shoulder rubs went a long way.  

"Alright, let's go," he announced. 

They met in the space between the kitchen and living room on a big patch of open floor. In a manoeuvre practiced only once before, they joined hands in preparation for the teleport. 

"Before we leave, I just want to say that you all look incredibly beautiful tonight." 

He was met with beaming smiles all around. 

"Even me?" Immi squeaked from her perch on his shoulder. 

"Hmm, maybe not ALL of you," he teased the sprite who dutifully fell into a pout. 

"Meanie," she accused, her bottom lip looking about twice it's usually petite size. 

"Of course you too, Immi," Chris reached up to pat her reassuringly. "What I was trying to say, is that I feel incredibly blessed to have found all of you, to be making a family with you." 

Petra broke the ring and strode forwards, wrapping herself around his solid frame with a heated growl and mashing her lips into his. Heedless of the jubilant sprite who cheered them on from his shoulder. 

"We feel the same way, Chris, all of us," She purred when she finally released him. 

Chris took a glance around as everyone huddled in for a big hug. Only Lillian distanced herself, a thoughtful smile unconsciously betraying her to the dragon. 

"Come on, Lillian," He beckoned her over light heartedly. "We'll just go like this." 

The vampire met his eyes and took his hand in hers. Already, his energy was flowing out to envelope the group hug, giving him an intimate awareness of their presence. He held that feeling and extended the effect down his arm towards the beautiful vampire. 

Her eyes met his again and her mouth flashed open in an unnecessary intake of breath at the sensation of his magic flowing over her skin, enveloping her. Then everything went grey. 

Chris took his bearings momentarily as they merged into the Ether, noting yet again that the native flora was growing out of control. It was almost like a botanic garden inside the apartment now. His aura was providing ample energy for the plants, fungi, and even a mysterious coral-like polyp to grow in abundance. 

Susan looked up at the ceiling in wonder at the smorgasbord of rare and valuable ingredients wafting their leaves lazily in some light, unseen breeze. 

"Oh, Chris, that's..." she started. 

"Yes, mage wort," Chris interrupted. 

"I could really use a little to jack up the potency of my transmogrifying potions." 

"Okay, Mom, I'll get some for you over the weekend, in fact you can come back in here and hack away to your heart's content. It's getting a little overgrown. Okay. Everyone ready?" 

A chorus of yeses were murmured back at him, most of them were looking around in interest at the lush grow of alien flora, it wasn't every day you got a free trip into the Ether after all. 

"Here we go then!" Chris whooped, releasing his energy and feeling the ripple wave translate out around him, guided by the energy field he'd used to pull the ladies into the Ether. 

There was a strange moment of incorporeal nothingness. Like his consciousness was put on hold and only the passage of time remained in his senses. Then they were standing in a darkened alleyway behind the Cauldron. Try as he might, Chris' study of physics and chemistry had yet to explain much of anything about his other magical abilities, let alone phasing. 

As Lillian broke away to knock on the back door, he swayed slightly on his feet, the cost of the spell digging deep into his reserves. 

"Are you okay?" Annabel asked, feeling his big body quiver against her. 

"I'm fine," he smiled back. "It's pretty hard going pulling so many of you along with me, thankfully it wasn't a very big jump." 

"Additional mass and complexity increases the energy cost of a jump exponentially," Immi lectured from her pulpit. "He has performed admirably to bring us all here without a single displacement." 

"Displacement?!" Susan's voice rose an octave in alarm at the mere possibility of such a potentially deadly end to their travel. 

"Relax, Mom, I wouldn't do it if I wasn't confident. Immi has been helping me practice," Chris put his hand on the witch's shoulder, squeezing comfortingly. 

A slot in the thick steel door into the alley slid open almost comically. 

"Who is it?" a deep, mumbling voice asked. 

"Lillian," the well-dressed vampire replied simply. 

"Pretty," was the only reply. 

"Well, thanks," she smiled, waiting unfruitfully for the door to be opened. "Aren't you going to let us in?" 

"Not supposed to," the slow voice answered. "Last time I let a pretty lady in I got in troub..." 

"Out of the way. Out of the way! Don't I pay you big oafs enough to listen to me! That's a special guest out there," Rufus Veldeer's frustrated voice leaked out into the gloomy alley. 

There was a shuffling noise and a thud as something was knocked over. Then a deadbolt was pulled aside with a satisfying 'shick' and the excited club owner was suddenly in front of them. 

"Ogres!" he exclaimed by way of explanation, gesturing over his shoulder at the hulking bouncer lurking inside the doorway. While Chris might be a little taller, the huge being in his human form was like a walking tank, so bulky with muscle and fat that it ruined any chance that he would ever pass as normal. 

"Hello, Rufus," Chris smiled, extending a hand for the vampire to shake. 

"Chris, my boy! Come in, come in," Rufus and Chris shook hands firmly before he began beckoning everyone inside enthusiastically, speaking a few words to each as the passed inside. "Hello, Annabel. Susan, looking lovely as ever. Ohh, you must be the wonderful Immianthe. Ahh, the Godran beauties. My bartenders can prepare a wonderful selection of non-alcoholic drinks if you like. Michelle, I've heard good things about your efforts with the Revelation. Lillian. I don't want any of your usual gloominess this evening. It's a party, you're supposed to have fun. You do remember what fun is, don't you my dear?" 

Lillian give her fellow vampire a beatific but obviously staged smile. Petra, Claire, and Michelle, who didn't know Rufus turned to watch how she would react. 

"Well of course I do, Rufus," Lillian's voice was saccharine. "Why, I recall an evening just a few decades ago when I walked in on you and..." 

"No! No No No," He rushed forwards, looking like he was contemplating clamping his hand over her mouth. "Good god woman, these are decent people. How could you even think of mentioning that particular evening?" 

"Well, it was fun," Lillian smirked. 

"Hmm, it was." An almost dreamy smile consumed him for a moment before snapped back to his senses. "Enough of that, and I'd thank you to never mention it again in such esteemed company. Down the corridor everyone!" 

"What happened?" Immi's curiosity was peaked as they were guided around the silent ogre and down the hallway towards a black curtain, the notes of some sort of mellow electronic music becoming louder as they went 

"I'm afraid it doesn't bear repeating in civilized company, Your Grace," Rufus startled everyone with his formal address to the sprite. No one ever really acknowledged it but she was technically a princess. 

"Don't start with that silliness, vampire. I'll turn you into a sundried-tomato if I hear one more ounce of pomp from you. It's a party, remember?" Immi threatened. 

"As you wish," Rufus turned to smile up at the sprite before bowing deeply, an elaborate hand motion pulling aside a black curtain to reveal a small room. "I shall keep my pomp strictly to the nonverbal." 

Annabel and Chris couldn't help but laugh as Immi's little fists clenched and her wings fluttered in indignation. 

"Don't worry about Immi, Rufus," Annabel teased. "You're going to be a good girl, aren't you Immi?" 

Immi's outrage drained, thinking about what was at stake for her good behaviour. It was her absolute favourite. 

"Yes, Mistress," she peeped, her shoulders slumping in resignation. 

Funnier still to both Chris and Annabel, was Rufus' open mouthed shock. Lillian tapped it closed for him on the way past. 

"Chin up, cousin. Who do you think's having more fun, Rufus. You? Or me?"

--------------------------------------------
Once they emerged from the back of the coat room, Chris remembered Hailey's instructions and headed around the bar towards the roped-off stairs. It was still early and there were mostly the regulars around, Beings perched near the bar or in quiet booths. Their party drew interest as they passed but no one approached. Someone did point as they whispered to get their friend's attention. 

"Are you sure the enchantments here will be able to disguise Immi?" Annabel wondered aloud. 

"This bar is run by a vampire, it can handle it," Lillian assured. 

The stairway to the VIP area which had been rented for the party was unguarded this early in the night, so they climbed on up the richly carpeted steps. Chris' assumption to follow his nose toward the delicious scent of food turned out to be the right move. 

"Chris!" Hailey rushed up to them, slowing as his brood followed through the doorway, fanning out around the dragon. It made quite a formidable sight to the hopeful young werebison but she was met with smiles and even a genuine twinkle or two as she met their eyes in turn and introduced herself. 

"Hi everyone, I'm Hailey. Hopefully, Chris has at least mentioned me a little?" 

"Of course he has, Hailey," Susan assured. "I think you've met everyone before except Claire, Michelle, and Petra." 

"Hi Hailey, thank you for inviting us tonight. We haven't really gotten out all that much recently, this is really nice," Claire said. 

"Yeah, thanks," Annabel agreed. "Sorry for being late, I hope we didn't cause any trouble." 

"It's fine," Hailey assured them, pointing across the room to the line of people waiting with plates in hand. "The buffet only arrived a few minutes ago. Rufus organised with the restaurant next door to provide dinner and it's supposed to be really good." 

"It certainly smells delicious," Susan agreed. "Why don't you introduce us to the birthday girl before Chris starts salivating too much. He hasn't had anything since lunch and you know how your father works him." 

"It's how you've been working him I'm worried about, Susan," Petra joked. 

Susan smiled wickedly and slapped playfully at the dragoness. Meanwhile, Hailey led them over to a professionally set table where several people were seated. Chris couldn't help glancing down at her figure, the only part of the outfit she'd changed since this afternoon was the addition of an elegant pair of white, high-heeled strappy sandals. They did wonderful things to her petite frame. 

A very athletic looking young woman sprung up from the table when she noticed who was approaching. Her jeans were painted on and her red crop top contrasted nicely with her medium length straight black hair as she bounced excitedly next to Hailey, waiting for an introduction. 

"Oh, my God. Hailey! I was almost starting to think you were full of shit but it is him," she made no attempt at tact. 

"Hi, happy birthday. You must be Lauren," Chris extended his hand politely. 

"Thank you, Chris. I'm really happy you all made it," Lauren replied. "When Hailey mentioned that she'd been hanging out with you I thought it would be a wonderful way to introduce you to some of the younger Beings here in Denver. There really aren't that many of us so we've got to stick together." 

"Yeah, I've noticed that actually. So, if you don't mind me asking, what sort are you?" 

"Of course, I don't mind. I'm just a boring old werewolf," Lauren smiled. 

"There's nothing boring about that!" Chris enthused, he'd been looking for an opportunity to talk to another melded predator species about how their animal instincts influenced their thoughts and magic. 

Lauren beamed, finally starting to believe what Hailey had been telling her all week, that he was just a regular guy. Even as he introduced her to his attractive broodmates, she didn't detect any smugness or superiority from the man who was clearly satisfying them all. 

"Here, we made you a present," Chris continued. "We weren't really sure what would be appropriate so we went pretty generic. Sorry." 

Petra produced a neatly wrapped little box, about two inches by three from her purse and presented it to Lauren. 

It was hastily unwrapped to reveal a large, glittering quartz crystal, faint tendrils of purple energy wriggling inside. 

Lauren was speechless for several moments. While she'd never been very strong with magic as a werewolf, her senses allowed her to understand the depth of energy contained in the lattice network of the gemstone. It was certainly the largest magic vessel she'd been allowed to hold. Maybe her pack had some larger ones stored away in their private vault, but they would never be simply given to her as a gift, they were far too valuable. 

"Guys, this is... Thank you," Lauren jumped forward and wrapped her arms around Chris, then proceeded to repeat the embrace with each of the surprised women. She held the gem close to her breast one last time before placing it reverently back in its box. 

"You're welcome. I'm glad you like it," Chris wasn't sure what else to say. 

"Of course I like it. This is so cool, I can't believe you're actually at my party!" Lauren yipped excitedly and began pulling him forward, intent on introducing her new friends to everyone. 

*** 

The evening progressed and Chris was introduced to almost everyone. There were so many names, he was sure he couldn't remember even a quarter of them. A lot of Lauren's family and pack members were there. Their pack was small and relatively rare in that it was based in a hub city. Most Were-Being packs chose to establish themselves further away from the influence of the territory leaders. It wasn't that they were necessarily doing anything nefarious, just that it was nice to stake out your own area and have it to yourself. 

There were also a few familiar faces he was beginning to recognise from the Denver Being community, including Tosh and his daughter Hinata. The Japanese arachnid was the Maginet territory admin and made a joke that he'd had to do extra work ever since Chris signed up for his device. 

His daughter seemed especially timid, standing stock still beside her father with downcast eyes while they chatted. The quiet woman was the epitome of Japanese beauty but didn't offer a single word or look his way despite the dragon's appreciative, if furtive glances. He couldn't help noticing her hips and bottom seemed extremely large for a woman of otherwise slim build. It was obvious she was attempting to hide it with loose clothing, but the task was nigh impossible. His dragon instinct couldn't help admiring her childbearing potential. 

It seemed to Chris that Lauren must be quite popular to have so many people come to her birthday, all of whom seemed genuinely interested in being there. 

Dinner was spectacular. The restaurant that Rufus had organised the catering with specialised in pasta. Chris went back for seconds of everything. Rich Bolognese sauce with pungent parmesan grated on top, finished with pine nuts. Creamy blue cheese sauce around spinach and feta ravioli. Pumpkin and garlic flavoured gnocchi. It all disappeared inside his bottomless stomach along with chunk after chunk of addictively good garlic bread. 

The ladies were more reserved in their appetites but very appreciative. Annabel was especially interested in the gnocchi, wonderful little pasta dumplings that seemed to melt perfectly into an explosion of flavours when bitten into. She was going to have to try making her own sometime. 

When Chris got up for his third huge helping, even Immi started teasing him about being a glutton, which Chris thought was highly hypocritical. Nonetheless, Susan cautioned him not to get too carried away or he would be uncomfortably full when she took him dancing. Grudgingly, he deferred to her motherly judgement. 

After dinner, everyone milled around chatting and laughing. Hailey pulled Chris, Annabel and Claire over to the bar and asked them what they wanted to drink. They were already familiar with Rufus' rather lax attitude towards the younger Beings having a drink or two, so Chris had a beer while Hailey and Annabel each had a glass of white wine. Claire had trouble making up her mind but eventually ordered a non-alcoholic watermelon-mojito mocktail. Then Hailey led them over to the big glass window at the end of the room which looked out over the club below. 

Things were starting to heat up downstairs. Although they couldn't hear the music being played due to some rather magical sound dampening in the VIP area, the sea of bodies jostling and writhing on the dance floor made it clear that there was an enjoyable time to be had. 

"That does look fun, doesn't it?" Hailey asked, looking hopefully towards Chris. 

"Yes," he smiled back. "We can go down there, can't we?" 

"Chris, are you asking me to dance?" the young werebison teased. 

"I... yes?" His face started turning beet red and he shot a guilty look towards Annabel. 

"Like fish in a barrel," Claire giggled and took a sip of her drink. "He's so easy to tease it almost ruins the fun." 

"Almost, but not quite," Annabel agreed. "Well if you're going down there I'm coming too, you simply can't be trusted alone with a young lady as gorgeous as Hailey. She'd probably wind up mysteriously pregnant." 

Hailey's shocked look quickly turned into a peal of laughter as a mortified Chris hung his head. She couldn't believe they were teasing him so. 

"I promise I'll be good. Please can I dance with him, Annabel?" Hailey entreated. 

"Well of course you can, Hailey," Annabel smiled. "But you're going to have to learn to share if you want to join our little club." 

"What?" Chris spluttered. 

"Really?!" Hailey almost squealed before looking around to see if anyone else had noticed. 

Annabel and Claire smiled, sharing a knowing look before turning back to the excited young werebison. 

"Yes," Annabel said. 

"On a probationary basis," Claire qualified. 

"Mmm, yes, subject to good behaviour," Annabel smirked, stroking a hand up Chris' shirt and across his broad chest. She looked right into Hailey's eyes, establishing her authority as First. 

"Or bad behaviour. As the case may be," Claire giggled. 

"You guys are the best! I've already thought of so many ways I can help out. Yes!" Hailey jumped and threw herself around Chris, wrapping her legs around his waist and arms around his neck. She stole their first kiss from his gobsmacked lips as his big arms automatically wrapped around her, cradling her against him. Her warm, insistent kissing ignited a dangerous flame in his loins. Soon their tongues were doing a slippery tango as she began hunching her body into him in a rather lewd rhythm. After almost half a minute, they came up for air, chests heaving. 

"Oh my fucking god, you smell amazing," Hailey panted, loving the spicy masculine scent of the dragon up close. 

"Yes, he certainly does but Hailey, we think it would be a good idea to take things a little more slowly than some of us have done in the past," Claire looked to Annabel. 

"Ha!" Annabel chuckled at the dragoness. "That won't be hard. She'll be taking it slow if they wait another ten seconds before getting down and dirty on the floor!" 

"He's my mate," Claire said unapologetically. "It's instinctual, I had waited so long to find him." 

"I know, I'm only teasing. And we have this wondrous little love bump to be thankful for because of it." Annabel placed her hand reverently over Claire's lower belly, feeling the slight bulge of her swelling womb. 

"I think going slow is a good idea too," Chris' mind finally caught up enough to offer up a coherent sentence and he placed a reluctant Hailey back on her feet, mindful of making a scene. "Seriously you guys, I was only just talking with Susan this afternoon about how I was a conflicted about my feelings for Hailey. How did you know I was thinking about her joining our brood?" 

"Well, you're always talking about her," Annabel explained as Hailey looked up at him reverently, blue eyes huge with admiration. 

"You do?" Hailey asked happily. 

"Yeah, and Lillian kept us in the loop on all your little tricks and seductions, young lady," Claire tried for sternness but couldn't keep her face straight. "I'm surprised Chris here had the willpower not to pounce on you." 

"Sorry, I did feel a little bit bad about that," Hailey apologised. "It was sort of thrilling though, like I was tempting him to stray. I know I'm signing up to share him though." 

"Unbelievable. I know there's supposed to be magic involved with keeping a dragon's brood unified and loving but this is getting out of hand." Chris was yet again astounded that Annabel and Claire seemed to be simply absorbing Hailey into their little group. 

"And you're complaining, why?" Annabel cocked an eyebrow. 

"I'm not...It's..." he sighed, unable to articulate his feelings. 

"I've got this one, girls," Hailey spoke up. "Chris, it might seem strange by human standards but there's nothing wrong with your relationship with your brood. It's natural for a dragon. I consider myself lucky to have an opportunity to join you and I know a lot of other Beings would, too." 

"Hailey's right," Claire said. "We've talked about this, Chris. You might be blended with your dragon fully but you still haven't accepted everything that comes with being a dragon. You need to stop fighting your instincts." 

"Alright, alright, I get it," he surrendered. "Just go with the flow, huh? Alright then, Hailey, let's go downstairs and have that dance." 

*** 

One dance turned into several and Chris was soon intimately aware of the exact dimensions of Hailey's petite frame as she gyrated in sync with the beat. He tried keeping up with her movements and she didn't seem to mind his hopeless flailing. In the end, Chris woundup just holding her soft hips and rump possessively, their eyes staring lustily at each other as people writhed and boiled all around them. 

After a few more songs, Annabel and Claire pulled them over to the downstairs bar for a breather. Rufus saw them and beckoned them over to his private booth, introducing them to another vampire called Claus, who seemed the quiet type. Chris was a little wary of the strange vampire at first but soon warmed up to the man as Rufus began regaling them with stories of how he and Claus had met across the trenches during the First World War. 

Other people from the party began trickling downstairs and soon the rest of the ladies joined them at Rufus' booth. Lauren and a few friends were in tow. 

The effervescent host ordered a round of Champagne, toasting first the birthday girl and then the expecting dragonesses. Then it was Chris' turn to be passed around for dances with Lauren and her friends, but not before Susan dossed them with a little of her pheromone cancellation potion on their exposed skin. There were a few mild protests that she was ruining the fun but it was generally taken well. 

By now, he had a mild buzz going on and was feeling pretty damn good. The warm happy feeling was distracting, his dragon restless and eager for action. So too was the thumping music and the press of bodies in the dim light. Especially Lauren's as she bobbed her ass backwards, bumping his crotch before pulling away, smirking over her shoulder. 

He wasn't aware his hold on his concealment was slipping until it was too late. He grasped at his chest, tipsily trying to battle his essence back down into the core of his tummy where it would be imprisoned. He'd gotten so good at it lately that he barely had to think about it. Now it was rebelling, rioting inside him whilst he was inebriated and unable to cork it back up. 

It was no use. His magic settled comfortably in his solar plexus, radiating through his body and outwards, saturating the air. He let out a huge sigh, closing his eyes, his muscles relaxing into the glorious feeling of his full magical potential arcing between his cells. It felt so right. Why did he have to contain it all the time? Why couldn't he just be himself? 

Lillian's sudden presence broke his half-drunk reverie and he opened his eyes. She wore an inquisitive, almost concerned look as she placed her hand on his forearm. Lauren had taken several steps back, looking almost reverent as his magic washed over her, inner wolf wagging her tail like a happy pup. 

"What's wrong, Chris?" Lillian had to come close, leaning into his personal space to make herself heard over the music. 

Her scent hit him like a truck, affecting his inebriated dragon brain on an instinctual level. 

He found his arm slipping around her waist, pulling her close in that little red dress. A startled breath of warm air wafted across his skin from her open lips. Her huge breasts met his chest and yielded, pillowing against that expanse of solid dragon. Bolder still, he stepped forward between her legs, inserting a muscled thigh between her own. 

"Nothing's wrong, Lillian. I just lost control of my concealment. I may be a little bit drunk," his boyish smile disarmed her as he pressed his advantage, squeezing her voluptuous figure closer still. "You're so beautiful. Dance with me, Lillian." 

Lillian quivered in suppressed arousal. Never had she been so tempted. Never had he been so bold. His powerful body, his delicious scent, his sweet blood, his youthful innocence, it all sang to her inner beast. It took every ounce of her self-control just to break even with her wicked desires. Her own defences were left lacking as his big hands began roaming brazenly across her, separated only by thin red silk. All the while, his pulsing aura irradiated her magical senses, blocking out the world and leaving only him behind as they began swaying automatically with the music. His blue eyes hypnotizing. 

<em>Were they not a perfect match?</em> Her vampire whispered. 

"Chris..." she whispered, looking up into his handsome, guileless smile. "We can't... I...bloodpact..." 

He probably didn't hear her over the music. 

She could see his lips coming a mile away. It was almost slow motion but she was powerless against him. Her body betrayed her, not for the first time when it came to him. His face descended, eager for the caress of her plush lips, moistened automatically by her treacherous pink tongue. Her eyes fluttered closed and her back arched into him, accepting. 

<em>It was only one little kiss,</em> her inner fiend crooned as their lips finally met. 

Her tongue ventured out first, eager to taste him and was quickly accepted into his mouth. Her hands finally came alive, one sliding up his back, the other inching dangerously down his torso. He was absolutely delicious, sending her fangs into a terrible aching as they tried to meld their bodies completely. A piteous little whimper escaped her as his leg pressed against her flooded womanhood. She could feel the denim of his jeans on her soft inner thighs. Her bloodpact woke up with a vengeance as she blatantly broke the elf's orders. 

Chris couldn't believe he was finally kissing her and smiled into her full lips, breaking their kiss unintentionally. He found his roaming hands had done admirably while his brain was occupied by the beautiful vampire. One had a firm grip on the left cheek of her big silk covered ass, greedily assessing her marvellous flesh. The other was in the beautifully scented russet hair at the base of her neck, holding her close. It was refreshing to be looking almost directly into her brown eyes. She was perfect. 

"Chris, we shouldn't," Her hand came between them, pressing a little more insistently even though their lips were still barely touching. Her bloodpact was insistent against her insubordination now, tugging like an imaginary choke collar, cutting off her breath, searing at her skin. 

"I want you, Lillian." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
"You don't know what you want, you're too young." She couldn't hold his piercing gaze as she denied him, his look of hurt was too much. "I could never leave if you changed your mind. Besides, I'm indebted to another." 

She resisted when he cupped her chin but he wouldn't have any of it, exerting his considerable strength against her. She could have answered with her own and fought him easily enough but it would be childish. He waited until their eyes had met for several moments before speaking again. 

"I know exactly what I want. Everyone tells me to stop fighting my instincts, here I am. I would do anything for you, Lillian. You are a beautiful, caring person underneath your mask. I will buy your debt to Reyla, even offer myself instead if I must. I've missed you every day that you aren't with me this last month. I want you, Lillian, and I know we'll be perfect together." 

What was left of her jaded, human heart broke. All her promises to ensnare him, to taste his blood, to fuck him, to steal him away for her own and break her bond with Reyla came flooding forward. Her chance was now, offering himself without condition. But she was a wicked, evil creature. She was the spawn cast aside by the dark aggressors of that ancient war. Her inner beast snarled in rage as she exerted her will into a resolution against everything that she was. This pure creature of unimaginable magic and goodness would not be tainted and destroyed by her. He would certainly not be allowed to offer himself to Reyla in her place. That would be unacceptable for she knew the elf would take such a deal in a heartbeat and the dragon would be lost to her forever. 

"I can't, not yet," it sounded weak even to her. Their bodies still clung to each other desperately though she was starting to regain control over her base desires. 

"Liar," he growled, hurt to have her reject him even after his admission. 

"I can't," the steel was back in her voice and she used her strength to step away, breaking his grip on her buttocks. "I'm sorry it's come to this." 

"Lillian... No, please." Now he sounded weak and her already throbbing heart felt like someone had thrust a silver knife deep inside. His feelings were genuine, she knew this. He truly wanted her, vampire and all. It nearly broke her resolve to see him like this, so ruined. 

She had to get away, was on the verge of flying back into his embrace. 

"We can't be trusted with each other. It is the only way, I will demand a replacement from Reyla tomorrow morning. We can say goodbye, but after tonight you won't see me again." 

The very thought of never seeing her, never hearing her adorable Russian accent, never being close to her again sent anguish to sear his pounding heart. Tears formed in his eyes, blurring her. He blinked them away hurriedly, afraid she would use her magic to disappear altogether. 

He reached out but her telekinetic power stopped him in his tracks, used against him for the first time outside of training. 

"Lillian!" he almost choked, his throat was constricting painfully. 

"Enough!" she barked harshly. "I will see you safely back to the hotel this evening and then you and I will be done. It is for your own good. Now get a grip on your concealment before someone shows up." 

She was gone, pushing past him and fading in his senses, invisible. 

"I won't give up on you," he hoped desperately that she was still listening. 

*** 

Lauren led the heartbroken young dragon back to the others. Having witnessed the entire thing, from the panty soaking first kiss to the spiralling abyss of rejection, she should be jumping with joy. The juicy gossip she could share would have her entertained for weeks but she just felt too bad for the sweet young man. Already, she knew she would be keeping this to herself. 

His beautiful entourage quickly surrounded the distraught dragon, extracting a stammered version of events even as he was still struggling with excessively moist eyes. Thankfully no one was tactless enough to suggest collecting the dragon's tears, though Susan would have had to admit to being a little tempted. 

Rufus was more than a little concerned for his cousin but ordered a round of shots, his finest tequila, and offered the use of his booth to them for the rest of the night. Hosting complete for the time being, he went off to have a word with his cousin. He wanted to hear her side of things. Surely giving the young dragon a roll in the hay would be easier on everyone than this disaster. He knew Lillian wasn't averse to a casual fuck. If this somehow came back badly against vampires there would be hell to pay, the Vampire Council was very interested in this particular dragon. So was everyone else. 

Michelle offered everybody who wasn't part of their brood an apology for bringing the tone of the evening down and asked that they be given a little space. Soon the curtain was drawn across the front of the booth and what was going on could only be guessed at by curious onlookers. 

Inside, everyone took turns trying to console him and he soon enough pulled his shit together externally. Internally was a different story altogether. His shit was all fucked up, a huge shit-tornado ploughing through his feelings. It felt like he was being torn apart from the inside. 

His dragon was keening sorrowfully. It was so tempting to just phase out of there and fly away. Petra and Claire would come, keeping pace with him as he fled from the wreckage of his unrequited love. A glance at the two dragonesses only made him feel worse, their support and concern practically radiated around them booth. All of his brood shared his pain, sending their feelings of love and comfort his way, even little Immi, who hugged as much of him as she could get her arms around. 

Only Annabel's face betrayed her anger, which he quickly worked out was directed at Lillian, not himself. 

He was so lucky to have them. Flying away to escape would be so unfair. Perhaps the cowardly act could wait until tomorrow and simply be used to distract him and dull his hurt. 

He wasn't sure what to do. Should he leave now and abandon Lauren's party? Should he wait until they were the last people in the joint so no one else would see him? Should he teleport them all to Antarctica and live out the rest of his days as an honorary emperor penguin? 

In the end he took a shot glass of the offensive smelling liquor from the tray in the middle of the booth and downed it. 

He never did manage to get his concealment back up. 

*** 

The club was winding down when they did finally leave. Chris was starting to sober up which didn't help how he felt. The numbness of alcohol and comfort of holding his loved ones close had acted like a Band-Aid, which was now being pulled off rather slowly. 

They would be walking back to the hotel, obviously Chris was in no state to be attempting a teleport. Immi was already squeezed into a backpack Rufus had lent Annabel, safe from prying eyes for the journey home. 

As they approached the main entrance of the club, he could sense Lillian, waiting for them in the shadows ever mindful of her duties. 

Chris wondered if Reyla would really remove her as his guardian. He almost hoped she wouldn't but that would be too cruel a fate for the vampire. Despite the animosity between the two powerful women, he feared that if it really came down to it; Reyla would have to give in or lose Lillian as an asset altogether. If only that stupid bloodpact could be nullified maybe he and Lillian could... He had to stop. She had made her choice, he could respect that even if he didn't agree. 

"Please come out, Lillian. I won't make a scene. I promise." He spoke softly to the patch of darkness he knew contained her. 

Her form appeared silently and any tiny hope he'd had that she'd miraculously changed her mind was shattered forever. Her features were deadpan, showing no hint of emotion whatsoever. 

Thankfully, Annabel managed to keep her anger bottled up tight and the rest of his brood looked almost sympathetically at the vampire. She'd been a part of their family, a friend. It hurt to lose her. 

"Let's go," was all Lillian said before turning and walking out the door onto the well-lit street, looking as devastating as ever in her skin tight red dress. 

Chris sighed heavily and followed, mindful that a group of tipsy humans were waiting behind them to get out. 

Something tickled in the back of his mind as his foot came down on the sidewalk. He stopped, the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end and he looked up sharply. Lillian also had her hackles raised, watching tensely for anything amiss. His arm shot out backwards, warding off Annabel as she came through the door. Something was wrong, his dragon knew it. 

"Chris wha..." Annabel asked. 

Tyres squealed slightly as a vehicle came to life and accelerated hard from down the street. He couldn't see it in the path of any street lights. Chris watched as Lillian turned her head towards the noise, he saw the intent, predatory focus on her face. 

The side of her head exploded. 

A dull thump-whistle followed, sounding loud in his enhanced senses as his world closed in. It couldn't be real, her body losing its life, falling limply to the concrete. A deep, bone-aching cold settled upon him. 

"Lillian!" Annabel screamed, watching horrified as a mist of blood and gore began to settle on the sidewalk. 

Lillian, his friend, his teacher, his protector, his family. His brood. She was his brood, and she was dead. 

Anger warmed him dangerously, like the hot exhaust of a weed whacker in the middle of a summer drought. His chest burned hot with fury. Thankfully the vampire's days of training began kicking in, he assessed. He had to do this quietly, no big scene. The club's enchantment should protect his actions at least a little bit. Strange, he sensed no magic other than that first tickle when they'd walked out into the street. 

"Stay back, all of you! Annabel, shield! Like we practiced." He rushed forward to crouch near the fallen vampire, heedless of his own safety. 

"Oh fuck, oh fuck," Annabel tried to concentrate on sending her thoughts to Bartholomew. It didn't help that she was still a little tipsy. And Lillian. Lillian was gone. She'd been so angry with her after what they'd shared. She'd thought it had been clear she would join them eventually. 

Screams echoed in the club as someone behind, curious at the commotion, caught a glimpse of the blood splattered pavement. 

Annabel hoped to god that the enchantments around the club would hold up to this level of pressure. What she was about to do could get them all in serious trouble. 

Lillian's body lay on its side, not even twitching. Chris could see the wound, blood and brain matter seeping into her hair, flecks of broken skull arrayed like a macabre jigsaw puzzle. No one would be putting this one back together. 

Michelle stuck her head out of the doorway for an instant, assessing the situation. Not a moment too soon she pulled it back inside and another muffled shot rang out, splintering the wood next to where her head had been. More screams rang out from inside. 

Michelle put two and two together. 

"Chris! They're trying to snatch you, come back here now!" There was a reason the sniper wasn't shooting at him. 

A white transit van screeched to a halt in front of him. The door slid open and Chris was facing three gun barrels. 

"Bartholomew, please," Annabel whispered desperately. "I need you." 

A warm breeze brushed her cheek, a confident, calming aura washed over her. Her back straightened automatically. 

"Feel for him, Mistress. Be clear in your intent, calm. You have done this before. I will lend my strength," Immi's beating wings ruffled her hair as the sprite alighted on her shoulder. 

It gave Annabel a huge boost to know her companion and teacher was there to support her. She felt the little tattoo, agitated, afraid, unsure what to do. She embraced him, feeling their very essence merge. Immi was right, they had practiced this before. The rest came easily back to her and she stepped out onto the street. 

Anyone watching would have thought she was insane. A tiny shimmer in the air around her was the only clue to her intention. 

"Come with us peacefully and no one else dies," spoke one of the men behind a balaclava. 

Chris' eyes flashed pure hatred their way just as he felt Annabel's shield pass over and envelope him. 

"You killed Lillian, you're fucking dead." The coolness in his voice was not his own. He was all dragon. 

"Our sniper has your girlfriend here in his sights, don't do anything stupid," the man reasoned, his voice uncompromising. 

<img src="1/1-1.jpg" width="158" height="91" title="1-1.jpg">Immi giggled, an entirely unsettling tremor of high pitched mirth. 

"Fuck this! Tranq 'em and take the girl down!" one of the others cried out as he got a look at Immi. "We don't know what the fuck that thing is." 

Their leader quickly brought up a strange pistol, firing it with a thump. At the same time, another dull, silenced crack zipped down the street from the high-powered rifle. 

A large dome of air shimmered purple on the sidewalk as the startled attackers watched their tranquiliser dart freeze in the air, barely five inches in front of its intended target. It fell to the ground. Over to Annabel's right a heavy 7.62mm pill ricocheted into a nearby car with an angry snarl. 

Chris leered evilly back at them. 

"Shit!" The leader with the tranquiliser gun dropped it to the floor of the van and drew a pistol, fear beginning to cloud his judgement. 

The target vanished into thin air. His teammates fired out of instinct, their machine pistols belching out a hail of bullets towards the girl and the tiny blue woman. Thin propellant haze hung in the confined van as bullets skimmed, rebounded and were even stopped dead in their tracks by the strobing purple dome. 

"Jesus fuck, my ears!" The van's driver screamed as the guns clicked empty after barely two seconds of automatic fire. 

"Bad boys!" Immi's high-pitched cackle was the stuff of nightmares. "Were you trying to hurt little old me?" 

Their shell casings could be heard rolling out of the van onto the street with a faint tinkling. 

"Fuck it. Abort. Get us out of here!" the leader roared, covering the girl and the small blue woman with his pistol as his teammates began reloading. 

"I don't think so." 

Chris merged back into the Norm almost instantaneously nowadays. 

From the passenger's seat of the van, he slammed the heel of his palm against the drivers unsuspecting temple. As if that wasn't enough, the force of the blow propelled his head into the driver's window, shattering the safety glass into a thousand pieces. 

There wouldn't be any more sniper fire. Two hundred yards away, in a bedroom on the third floor of an old apartment building, a man lay hunched over his rifle. He was still, his neck cricked at an impossible angle. 

The leader brought his pistol to bear just in time to see his target in the front seat vanish again. His operation was going sideways at an astronomical rate. 

That tranquiliser would have put him down for the count for sure, it was some black-market shit. If only they'd managed to hit him with it... he dropped his pistol and dove out onto into the gutter. Behind him, a muffled shriek spelled the demise of another of his teammates. He rolled and came up crouched, drawing the carbon-black combat knife from his thigh sheath. No one had seemed to notice him pick up the tranquiliser dart, the shield-girl was backing away warily towards her beckoning friends. 

"Leave him for Chris," Michelle urged Annabel back into the relative safety of the doorway. 

Annabel shrank her shield back with her and Michelle stepped forward to shelter her in case the knife wielder lunged forward. She needn't have bothered. Chris prowled out of the van like a vengeful jungle cat, his large, sinuous body radiating power. 

Behind them, Petra, Claire, Hailey, and Susan were trying to calm the people inside the club and direct them towards the emergency exit into the alley. People were crying and screaming, worked into a frenzy by the roar of automatic gunfire. There were a few game souls who, in panic, attempted to flee out the main door into the middle of the firefight and had to be forced back. 

"Make sure he stays alive," Michelle ordered Chris, halting his advance on the man, who stood boldly stalwart against the vengeful beast. 

The man in question wondered that such a creature could be contained in this masquerade of a young man. 

Having reconsidered his assault, the dragon attacked. He sprang forward, pressing the balaclava wearing knife-wielder instantly into retreat. He pressed again, throwing a punch the man should see coming. Half way into the blow, as the man was already reaching to slice his underarm with that wicked blade, he phased. A micro-teleportation later in the bland looking Ether, he merged back, wrapping one arm around the man's throat from behind, squeezing. His other hand applied inhuman strength to the man's knife wielding wrist, bones crunched. The weapon clattered uselessly into the gutter. 

The already weakening man's breath left him in a strangled cry of pain, but not before he jabbed his non-ruined arm against Chris' thigh. 

Chris felt the prick of the needle in his thick quadricep but was unable to do anything about it for a few seconds as he struggled the last of the man's strength away. When the body went limp, Chris put him down rather unceremoniously and yanked the fluffy-tailed dart out. 

He stared at it, eyes blinking heavily. 

"Shit," he slurred, "I've... Lillian..." 

His huge body lurched forwards, the dart dropping from his grip as he staggered the few steps to the vampire's corpse. He slumped to his knees. 

"I'm s..ssorry, I'm sorry," he could barely speak, and his vision was starting to fade at the edges. Maybe it would be nice to drown this all out for a while? 

Someone rushed over to the unconscious man to check on him. Michelle. 

"She yet lives, Master," the sprite chirped in his ear, her cheerful timbre coming out of nowhere. He hadn't even noticed her land at his side. 

"Wha... What?!" Chris' mind rallied against the seductive heaviness falling over him. 

"Yes, though grievously wounded, her head has not been severed from her neck. The wound is not infected with silver. Lillian may recover if she drinks enough blood right away. Of course, your blood would be preferable, if anyone could heal her it would be you. Time is of the essence." 

"Her brr... her brain," Chris mumbled sleepy disbelief. Immi seemed far away, speaking through a badly connected phone. 

"Your blood can save her!" The sprite shouted up at him almost petulantly. "Stupid dragon." 

Chris looked down at the sprite, confused, comprehension only just starting to seep in. 

A siren could be heard approaching. He had to get her out of here but he just couldn't. He was so tired. 

"Go master, I will watch over the others." The sprite reached out her tiny finger and a zap of crackling energy arced out to the skin of his forearm. 

Chris' head shot up like he'd been jabbed with a cattle prod. A temporary surge of the sprite's energy reanimating his sluggish nerves. He barely had the focus necessary to cradle Lillian in his arms, let alone teleport with her. Where would he go? She was covered in so much blood, she would drink his blood. Would it be messy? Focus. A bath? 

He gathered his energy and pulled her deathly body into the Ether with him. 

A tiny pop heralded his merge back. He stumbled into the wall of the bathroom, mashing at the light switch with his shoulder. Thankfully, it came on with a yellow glow as he swayed over to the huge semi triangular bathtub. He stepped inside as gracefully as possible, which wasn't saying much in his condition. Immi's little jolt was wearing off quickly. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
He made sure to cradle her head against his chest as he sat down, afraid her already scrambled brain would simply fall out of the gruesome wound. He tried to lay back and fell instead, the insidious relaxation creeping rapidly back through his senses. 

Blood. Remember blood. 

His teeth transformed admirably to their razor-sharp dragon form. He winced, biting into his wrist with a tearing motion. The thought made him feel queasy for a second before that feeling too was lost to the creeping darkness. He held the wounded wrist above her mouth, watching his rich lifeblood splatter down onto her blueing lips. He held the seeping cut to her mouth as he cradled her to his chest. His head lolling backwards onto the white plastic of the tub, narrowly missing a slightly protruding jet nozzle. 

*** 

Michelle sighed, wishing she wasn't still in her dress. 

All sorts of emergency response vehicle lights lit the street with a gaudy strobing. 

"So, you're telling me he disarmed four armed, dangerous men? This young man, Chris?" The senior detective was understandably sceptical of the mildly intoxicated club-goer with her fluffy bunny-eared headband. 

"Well, I mean, like, I don't know him. But my friend Bethany pointed him out to me because he's super-hot. But yeah, I caught a glimpse of him fighting this terrorist guy in a balaclava and totally putting him in this awesome sleeper hold." 

"And where is he now?" asked the suited cop. 

"Like, how am I supposed to know?" 

"Well what did he do after incapacitating the assailant?" 

"I don't know. It was crazy in there," a haunted look came over the young woman's face and the detective sighed, dismissing her back to her waiting friends and saying that she would be contacted later. 

Michelle had heard enough. She needed to step in now and guide the investigation along a suitable path, they knew too much to be left completely in the dark. This was far from ideal but it could be used if they played it right. She had to do something. 

"Detective Sergeant," she stepped around the side of the ambulance she'd been sheltering behind, causing the man to turn sharply. "I believe I can answer some of your questions." 

"It's not polite to eavesdrop, Miss..." 

"Michelle Hamund," she supplied. 

The detective thought Michelle cut an attractive figure with olive toned skin and short black hair, her figure wrapped up in a modest navy cocktail dress. She had that air about her though, he could almost smell them coming after twenty-five years with the Denver PD. She was a suit. 

"Tony Field, now let me guess. FBI?" 

Michelle only smiled, presenting her NSA id for inspection. She wondered how her title of Special Presidential Advisor would go down. 

"NSA huh, don't see you guys around here often." He snapped a picture of her id with his cell phone and handed it back to her. 

"Actually, I'm a witness, Sergeant," Michelle said. 

"Do you know this Chris character who keeps popping up? There aren't any god damn security cameras on this entire street so I don't even know what he looks like." 

"Well, yes. Chris Baryst, he's an... asset of ours. I'm here helping with some of his training, among other things." 

"Don't suppose you're going to elaborate on that," the detective shook his head in disgust. 

"Don't suppose I will," Michelle beamed cheekily back. There was just something about being higher on the chain of information that Michelle couldn't help enjoying. "Cheer up, Tony, you've got one heck of a story to break to all those reporters over there. They're going to gobble you right up." 

"Whatever, so you've got some hot shot kid in your stable who knows how to handle himself. What about the gunmen? What can you tell me?" 

"Actually, this one came out of the blue on us. I'm pretty sure it was targeted at our asset but I'd appreciate it if you kept that to yourself. I'd owe you one. Chock it up to another act of random, senseless violence," Michelle spun her magic, asking them for a favour always seemed to work. Most people have difficulty saying no. 

"So, this is not a terrorist attack?" Tony needed to be crystal clear about this part, the safety of his hometown was paramount to the desires of some cute NSA spook. It was all very well to keep the media's noses out of things, but he had to be sure this wasn't the start of something bigger. 

"No, we don't believe so at this time," Michelle said. 

"We don't believe so at this time," Tony parroted. "Nice. I might use that. And your asset, Christopher, where is he now? There are also a few accounts of a woman lying shot on the sidewalk. I'm sure forensics is about to have a ball cataloguing all the blood on the sidewalk." 

"Ah, yes. There was a woman shot, Christopher took her to get treatment before you arrived." 

"Her name?" Tony followed up. 

"I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to discuss that," Michelle hoped her smile would smooth out this last big wrinkle. 

"Jesus," Tony stewed. "You've got to be kidding me. You know I can't just throw the whole god damn thing out the window when you bat your eyelashes at me. We've got almost 80 shell casings in that van and bullet holes all over a downtown building. That doesn't just magically disappear when you snap your fingers. People want answers. What a fucking headache." 

"I can help," Michelle pulled her card from her wallet and passed it to the disgruntled detective. "I'll have someone call your station tomorrow morning and everything will be fine. We'll take the two surviving gunmen off your hands too. If the FBI gives you any stick, send them my way. In the meantime, I need you to get ahead of the story. Can you do that for me, please, Tony?" 

"What do you want me to say?" he sighed accepting her details. 

"Why don't you paint a nice little picture of our hero fighting off a deranged, mindless, and hateful attack before rushing a wounded woman to hospital, possibly injured himself." 

"Can I use his name?" Tony was tapping away in his phone madly. 

"Sure, but leave out any mention of my agency. Perhaps the girl you were talking to earlier could be approached by the media for her comment." 

"Of course," the detective's sarcasm was palpable. "What if something comes up?" 

"Don't worry, Tony. I'll be keeping an eye on things." 

"What? You gonna' work your spook magic?" Tony chuckled gruffly. Suits, they were so full of it. 

"Something like that," she smiled, if only the poor detective knew the half of it. "But for god's sake, don't mention anything about the sniper when you find him." 

"Sniper?!" the detective spluttered, looking cautiously up at the surrounding buildings. This was the first he was hearing about a sniper. 

Michelle was already turning to walk away and simply pointed down the street at an old apartment building. 

*** 

"I can't believe it, Dad, why would anyone want to hurt Chris? He's so nice," Hailey murmured, hugging Stephen close when he finally made it into the little conference room the dragon's brood had been escorted to. 

Everyone looked up as Reyla burst into the room, obviously seething, followed closely by Michelle and her head of security, Timothy Garril. 

Annabel shot up out of her seat and looked like she was about to demand something but was smart enough to catch Michelle's pleading look and frantic gesture to cut it out. 

"Well, this is just what I need," the beautiful Drow glowered around the room, performing her duties in a silken robe once again because the dragon's troubles had her up in the middle of the night. "A shooting in the middle of my district. Humans crawling everywhere. It will be a wonder if they don't discover the tunnels and connections leading to the Compound." 

"They won't," Tim assured. "The concealments are holding and we're quietly bringing in people who can help if they start to falter. Rufus says the enchantments at The Cauldron are fine even though there are police swarming all over it. They haven't even noticed our CCTV system." 

"I've taken care of the police and media," Michelle added. "Come tomorrow I will use my authority to take over the investigation. It will be a good first case for the team I've been putting together." 

"Yes," the elf purred dangerously as she paced back and forth in the confined space, everyone trying to give her room. "I'd like to know how this one slipped past our net. I'll admit you all did a satisfactory job of defending yourselves and containing the situation. Your enchantment is becoming quite formidable, Annabel." 

Annabel couldn't help a little smile as Reyla gave her a nod of approval. 

"Immi's been helping me," she explained proudly. 

Reyla's scowl returned at the mention of the sprite who'd gone back to observe the happenings at the club after they'd all made it to the safety of the compound. 

"Something tells me this was a human operation," Michelle speculated. 

"But why would humans want to kidnap Chris? Could it be Radek again?" Susan asked. 

Michelle and Tim shared a concerned look and Reyla paused her pacing at the mention of the name. 

"I don't think so," Tim said. "After the fact, the attack seems woefully inadequate to capture Chris. They didn't stand a chance. I also don't think it was any of the other troublesome characters we try to keep an eye on, there were no Beings on the scene. It was just a couple of humans." 

"They were well trained though," Michelle thought aloud. "It was a classic overwhelm and capture operation. It might even have worked if Annabel hadn't stepped in." 

"We wouldn't have let our mate be taken," Petra said coolly. 

"Yes, but having pictures of two full grown dragons rampaging around downtown on the morning news wouldn't have helped the situation at all," Reyla met the dragoness' glares head on. 

"Never mind, I'll find out more tomorrow when we take the two survivors into custody," Michelle eased the growing tension. 

"Is Lillian going to be okay?" Stephen finally asked. He'd known the vampire for several years now and just knew that things wouldn't be the same around Denver without her. She was like a buffer between Reyla and the 'real world.' 

"Treacherous bitch," Reyla hissed, her anger boiling over yet again, the malice in the words triggered several gasps around the room. "Her connection to me broke almost half an hour ago. I hope your young dragon knows what he's doing." 

*** 

It was just as wonderful as his scent had always promised. So strong, so rich. Her body tingled as the parasite animating her once living cells writhed in ecstasy, feasting on his powerful life essence. It was first in her mind as she began regaining consciousness, dominating her senses. It trickled over her wriggling tongue, a symphony of exquisite flavour and promised strength. 

His magic had already spread throughout her body, forcing quivers and shakes as her muscles fired involuntarily, reconnecting to nerve pathways as the terrible damage to her head was repaired. 

Something was rising inside her. 

It grew slowly but before long her whole awareness was filled with the strangest feeling, like her spirit was being pulled in two directions at once. Her body began shivering uncontrollably. 

Reyla's blood pact burned hot against the skin of her neck. The dragon's blood answered the challenge, racing through her veins to destroy the elf's. She tried to cry out, pain blossoming behind her eyelids. Her muscles locked in spasm, unable to even move as a battle raged inside her damaged body. It seemed to carry on interminably, but it was probably only a few minutes until she felt the tide turn. 

He was winning. The elf's craftful magic was no match for his raw power, not when his potent blood was seeping into her every cell. She felt his essence moving inside her, bonding, burning out all trace of the Drow's influence. When it finally ended, tears of blood were seeping from behind her eyelids. They were half from the pain and half from happiness, for she knew she was free from Reyla forever. 

When she finally calmed enough to enjoy his blood again, she wondered how it had come to this. She could remember turning, seeing the longing and sadness in his handsome face, then... her vampiric awareness could sense that half her brain was knitting and growing itself back together. She studied herself with that most basic of senses, watching the incredible regenerative power of the dark beast lurking inside her. Thankfully, it was consumed with repairing her and she didn't have to fight for dominance. 

As more and more of her consciousness returned, she slowly grew aware of her surroundings. His warmth beneath her, the rhythm of his steady breathing. Was he asleep? She still couldn't really move. 

His flavour was superlative. She knew now what the young vampire, Amanda must go through on a daily basis after tasting him. She had been right to warn Lillian, there was no way she could willingly return to human blood after tasting his rich, incredibly satisfying flavour. It was so heavy with life essence. She'd never imagined such a thing possible. He was so much better than her wildest fantasy. 

There was something lurking there in his taste... she couldn't describe it. Her sensitive tongue could sense his human and dragon heritage but there was something else blended into the background. It was completely novel. This was surprising given her half millennia of life as a vampire, yet her parasite was deeply satisfied and yearned to feast on it forever. 

Her womanhood came alive as more of his blood was absorbed. Such a delicious banquet had her dewing quickly, her sex giving an involuntary shudder of anticipation. She thought back to their argument. He had wanted to bed her, to truly have her as part of his brood. He felt for her. In truth, she felt something for him too. There was chemistry there and they had been dancing around each other for months now. 

Her reasons for resisting him were now moot. Already she knew that with his blood passing her lips, he had absolute influence over her. There was no trace of resentment. He had saved her. If she had his blood, she would grow powerful. Her inner beast was excited by the thought. To have such a rich source of sustenance at her beck and call could eventually make her a ruler amongst her kind. It was a deeply arousing fantasy for the twisted and power-hungry creature his blood had set free. 

It would not be without challenges. Firstly, she must jealously guard him from others of her species, from anyone. He would be hers alone, it was the only way. Greedy, she could not tolerate sharing him. He would have to be lured away from his little flock of leg-spreaders. How? With her body, of course. 

The beginnings of her wide smile twitched the corners of her mouth. It wouldn't be long now, her body was warming, becoming more responsive again. The poor boy wasn't going to know what hit him, he was dealing with a professional. 

*** 

A warm, pattering sensation intruded into his sleepy, dreamless mind. It felt so far away, so detached, yet still warm and pleasurable. The sensation rose up his body, accompanied by some sort of caress. He smiled stupidly, his mind foggy. 

It was water, he decided as the sensation splashed warm across his face, into his hair. A hand followed behind, massaging his scalp and making him groan in satisfaction. He felt his cock twitch, eager for the same treatment. A faint feminine coo reached his ears and a warm weight settled on top of him, squirming sensuously against his bare skin. 

Lips on his shoulder. Kisses. A hand ghosting teasingly down his abdomen, towards his swelling cock. A sharp nick of pain where her mouth touched him, raising his consciousness. A love bite? The woman sucked against his skin, sort of like the time Annabel gave him a mark on his neck. He could feel her body quiver against him, a muffled cry rising in her throat. 

His mind fought the effects of the tranquiliser, his body filtering the drug from his system as fast as he could. 

Her lips were against his ear, licking, nipping. 

"Wake up little dragon, I need your full attention." 

His eyes fluttered. He knew that voice. That adorable accent. 

"Mmhh, yes, that's it. Typical that your cock wakes up first." 

His body thrummed with warm arousal, a tortured groan of desire rising in response to her words, her touch. She leaned back and the warm water trailed back down across his chest and tummy, across his diamond hard erection. Her hand took a firm grip below his aching crown, squeezing almost torturously. Another cupped his testicles ever so gently and still the water splashed down. 

"Lillian," it came out as a hoarse moan. 

"Yes, my sweet, sweet dragon?" 

Finally, he managed to will his eyes open, squinting against the light and misting water. 

"Lillian!" 

"I'm right here, Chris," the vampire leaned forward, kissing his chin playfully. 

She was a vision above him, seen through bleary eyes. A wet, voluptuous goddess in red, her dress clinging indecently to her lush figure, absolutely soaked through. He blinked rapidly, hoping that it wasn't just his mind playing tricks on him. He thought it must be, the detachable showerhead was floating in mid-air next to her, spraying down over them both. 

"What... you're okay?" He frowned, trying to raise himself in the tub but finding his body unresponsive. Whatever had been in that dart really packed a punch. All he could do was raise his head a little, finally getting a decent look at her. 

"I'm fine. Thanks to your blood I've made a remarkable recovery." 

She still held his member captive, stroking slowly up and down like it was the most natural thing in the world. 

"Lillian! Your eyes!" Chris frowned, her usually hazel eyes were completely black. No pupil, no iris, no sclera, just a soulless black orb. His heart started to race. He barely managed to lift his head, looking down across their bodies. His clothes were shredded. Her hands, wrapped so lovingly around his manhood, were tipped with wicked black talons. "Lillian?" 

She smiled down predatorily, her pearly fangs coming to rest on her bottom lip. Her hands didn't release his throbbing cock as she leaned in, sniffing him, brushing her lips above his now thundering heart. 

"Just like a little scared little rabbit," she crooned. 

"Lillian!" he'd never seen her like this before. "Lillian, I can't move, the tranquilizer?!" 

"What tranquilizer?" she purred. "I've got you right where I want you." 

She sunk her fangs into his pectoral muscle without warning and there was absolutely nothing he could do. His arms lay uselessly at his sides. He groaned in pain as she slurped and licked greedily at the crimson fluid welling up in the two puncture wounds. A warmth spread out from the wound, his cock twitched harder when it should have been wilting in terror, a trickle of slimy precum leaking from the tip. Shit, it wasn't the tranquiliser at all! It was her vampire's feeding toxin. She had paralysed him and now she was going to fucking eat him alive! 

"Lillian, please! It hurts," he croaked. 

She giggled, a sound he was sure he'd never heard from her before. The vampire abandoned her meal to rise above him once again. His own blood stained her lips, running down her chin and onto her pale neck. Her dead eyes gave nothing away. No sympathy, no remorse, no emotion whatsoever. 

"What's wrong, Chris?" Suddenly he could feel her sinister claws against the tender skin of his ball sack, a threat any male would instantly understand. "One little peak at the real me and the big bad dragon is a whimpering little kitten? You'd better get used to this, young one. I resisted tasting you for months, tortured myself with your scent. You have done this yourself! You chose to feed me your blood. You broke my blood pact I will not go back after tasting you. Now you have to live with the consequences!" 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"I saved you, Lillian," he pleaded, fear and her venom draining him of power and reason. 

"Maybe you shouldn't have," her talons eased on his sensitive flesh and he let out involuntary whimper of relief. She looked down at his impressive cock before smiling wickedly back up at his handsome yet fear stricken face. Like this, it was so easy to picture him as just an innocent young man she'd snared for quick, savage feeding. It excited her immensely. "You're stuck with me, young one. But it's not all bad news. I'm going to put this big cock of yours to good use in a minute. Then we're going to disappear on a little trip for a while. You're going to forget all about your nice fiancé, your slutty step mom, and your two dragonesses. Just you and me for a few centuries, Chris. What do you say?" 

"No." His answer was instant and firm, his thoughts sharpening rapidly at the notion of being taken away from Annabel. He would never abandon her, let alone Petra and Claire, pregnant with his children. He would die fighting to stay with them, protect them, Susan and Immi too. 

Lillian smirked, releasing his cock and balls from her hands. She concentrated for a moment, turning off the shower head with her telekinesis and guiding it back to its holder. No longer did she need the elf's pact for this incredible ability, she had a dragon now. Already she sensed his power flowing through her veins, soon her might would be unchallenged amongst her kind. 

Shower shut off, she manipulated the effect of her ability down onto his towering erection, slipping it over his throbbing crown in imitation of her own mouth. She'd dubbed this one the 'air blow job' and the astonished look on his face was priceless. 

"Are you sure about that, Chris?" She asked coyly, flicking her wet brown hair and collecting it to drape across her bulging chest. "Are you sure you don't want a little time alone with me? You could have me any way you wanted." 

She could see him trying to resist the sensation of her telekinesis, feel his powerful body trying to squirm underneath her. All he managed was a little shudder of pleasure. 

"Oh, fuck," he whispered in disbelief. He could swear a plump pair of lips were working the sensitive ridge of his cock-head but there was nothing there. Then she added a tongue to the equation and it was all he could do to stop himself exploding. Something in her venom was forcing him toward blissful release. 

Lillian started running her freed hands up and down her flanks, brushing against the sides of her big breasts, putting on a show. The damp red silk of her dress did absolutely nothing to hide her figure or the erotic sight of her jiggling assets as she took up a sensuous writhing in his lap. 

"You know, Chris, back when I was a human, I had an... interesting profession. In my line of work, there was one immortal rule." 

She toyed with the little strap holding the gown on her pale shoulder. Nipples strained against the soft, clingy fabric. He'd never imagined such voluptuous perfection. He groaned at the erotic torture his cock was enduring, unable to move a muscle below the neck as she swayed above him with practiced grace. She was so god damn hot, but so terrifying. He was powerless and all the while she teased his manhood mercilessly with her unnatural ability. 

"It doesn't quite survive the translation from old Russian, but rule was basically, no free samples. You see, Chris, I was once a whore," her hands cupped the underside of her proud breasts as if weighing them. 

"Lillian..." 

"Shh. It's true. I was very, very expensive but a whore none the less, a courtesan," her grin widened, almost two big, black eyes fixed on his cock. "I'm going to fuck you like you've never imagined, Chris. You can have me however you like, whenever, wherever but you'll be paying in blood. Your sweet, warm, delicious blood." 

Her fingers brushed upwards, finally hooking black talons under the little spaghetti straps of her dress, teasing them over her pale shoulders. The fabric caught on the wet swell of her breasts, holding itself up. Chris was mesmerised as she smirked down at him, tugging lower. Slowly, her magnificent tits were revealed, and the red silk slumped around her hips. 

His cock spat a little precum in appreciation. They were huge, perfect teardrops, big nipples upturned, calling to his tongue. Jesus, they swelled wider than her torso. Gravity had them sagging only a little, weighed down by so much exquisite flesh. Despite the danger of the situation, he couldn't help but be incredibly excited. He'd been lusting after these since day one, so pale, perfect, and mottled almost blue with hints of veins. Her areolas were pebbled in obvious arousal, each a light brown, inch-wide, glistening magnet for his hungry lips. 

Then she leaned forward and put her hands on his chest, squeezing her breasts together between her arms in an extravagant display of endowment. His cock slid along her soft tummy as she lowered herself, grazing the bottom swell of her tits. The corner of her mouth twitched in amusement and her pink tongue shot out to swipe at the traces of blood on her chin, tracing her fangs whilst looking right into his soul. 

"Give it to me, dragon," She purred, doubling down on the strength of her magical cocksucking, extending the sensation torturously down his throbbing shaft. 

His cock swelled fatter, harder. An exquisite tightness grew in his root as his balls tensed in anticipation. He exploded. There was little he could do, her telekinetic caresses, her venom, the dark expanse of cleavage, the danger. He cried out, his eyes squeezed shut in pleasure as thick spumes of sticky cum shot out; firing again and again with great spasms of his abdomen. He couldn't move at all, helplessly spraying his seed up onto the voluptuous vampire's epic boobs and soft tummy. 

Lillian squealed in delight, the deluge of semen showing no signs of letting up. Each great spurt was as copious as the last, turning her into a glistening, frosted mess. 

"That's it. Oooooo, let it out!" She hissed even as his seed continued to splatter hot on her already wet skin. The thick white ropes merged like the tributaries of some great river to flood the deep valley of her cleavage and drip back down onto him. She never let up on her telekinesis, now enveloping the entirety of his mighty spear, coaxing everything he had. "I want to enjoy this cock properly so we'd better let all the tension out of these precious balls. Just think, the power to save a species but I'll be keeping it for myself. So wicked." 

"Lillian, fuck," He groaned in protest as the last of his prodigious load finally spurted weakly from his tip. His cockhead was almost a livid purple, throbbing, and incredibly sensitive between them, trapped in her unyielding caress. 

"My God, look at it all!" Lillian was honestly astounded at the volume of pearly baby batter covering her tits and both of their tummies. She'd never seen anything like it. She laughed, playing her fingers across her snowy breasts, making his seed run down and off the tip of her nipple. When she was sure he was watching, her finger rose to her plump lips. Her body stiffened as her tongue got its first taste of his spicy essence, rich with magic. The greedy digit quickly made a return trip, then another. 

"It is true," Lillian whispered huskily, her pussy thrumming in anticipation, a high-performance engine revving on the start line. 

"Lillian, let me up, please!" 

"Oh no you don't!" Her hands came to rest on his muscled chest and she hunched her hips into him. He could feel her sharp black claws threatening to pierce him. "We're barely getting started. I can't wait to feel you fetching off inside me, Chris. Jesus, it's a good thing vampires are sterile." 

He had no response, still recovering from his orgasm. 

Her cum-splattered boobs wobbled above his face as she began pulling the hem of her little red dress up over her wide hips. Lillian was an incredibly voluptuous woman. Tall, with a very pronounced hourglass figure. Seeing her thick, soft upper thighs come into view had his breath hitching in his throat. Her skin was so pale and perfect he could now see the hints of the veins all over her thighs and torso, he wondered if it was his own blood circulating inside her now. 

Those black orbs gazed down at him, impossible to read as she teased him with her body, rocking back and forth against the base of his dick but keeping her womanhood from his view. She released her mind-grip and took his cock in hand, jerking his thick length slowly. She held him up against her tummy, rubbing him on the soft, cum-flecked silk. 

"This is one big dick, Chris," she murmured appreciatively, feeling him twitch in her grip. "I absolutely love a large one but this is... well, it could be a little too much of a good thing. And you're still hard, what a stud. Are you going to make me squeal, Chris? Are you going to fuck me like you're paying for it?" 

"Let me up and you'll find out," defiance rose up in him to answer her challenge. 

"Hmm, nice try, young one, but I'll be the one doing the fucking today. I think I'll wear you out a little more before I let you have at me. Besides, I need a chance to get used to this monster." 

Lillian rose up off her knees, getting her feet underneath her in preparation to mount his stallion-like cock. Chris could only watch, catching glimpses of her enflamed womanhood as she jostled around above him; boobs jiggling this way and that, his sticky cum still clinging gallantly. Finally, she hiked her dress up and out of the way, holding him upright. Jesus, no panties this whole time? 

She was completely hairless, her juicy lips squishing out between her squatting thighs. He could see her glistening, leaking a clear, slippery fluid. She held herself suspended, slapping the angry red head of his cock against her leaking petals. He could feel her heat and moisture as he helplessly watched her big, frilly, pink clam getting ready to devour him whole. If anyone was going to manage it without a magical aid, it was going to be this deadly amazon-goddess. 

When he was nice and slick with her nectar, she slotted him in low on her weeping slit. A hiss left her lips as she pushed down. Her labia strained against the intrusion of his fat head but welcomed him inside with a wet little squelch, sinking down on a few inches of thick cock. 

"Ahhhh! Dah, Dah, Dah!" she shrieked as her pussy fluttered in joy. He was so damn big; stretching her, filling her right up, forcing her open. Just how she liked it. 

Chris had to grit his teeth. She was so slick and hot that his cock was sliding deeper and deeper as her weight pushed down. Her thick thighs were shaking as her vagina strained to welcome him in, over half of his huge erection finding a warm, gooey home inside her. Her black claws pricked his skin, drawing little droplets of blood to the surface as she threw her head back and screamed in wordless ecstasy. The pain mixed with the pleasure of her clutching pussy, confusing his brain between the two intense sensations. 

"So deep, so fucking deep," she chanted as she rocked down on the last few inches of dragon cock. "No one's ever... Fuck!" 

A firm bump in her core made her stiffen in pleasure, fighting against the rising climax in her tense body. She couldn't believe he'd just bumped her cervix, that was insane. 

"Oh fuck, Lillian... the whole thing!" Chris groaned, looking down his body to see her labia stretched thin, struggling around his girthy root. 

They stared at each other reverently, vampire and dragon, their hot genitals the perfect match. Neither moved for a long moment, just enjoying the sensation. Then she practically threw herself down on him, demanding his lips in their first passionate kiss. 

Chris kissed her right back, thrusting his tongue into her mouth, smelling her faint scent of honey as wet ringlets of hair fell around his face. He could feel her slick boobs pressed firmly into his chest, pancaking as she tried to eat his face. Their tongues fought for dominance. It was no surprise that he lost against her experience. She harried him back inside his own mouth and promptly claimed victory by pricking his bottom lip with her razor-sharp fangs. 

"Lillian, that fucking hurts!" he tried to move his head away. 

She giggled, uncaring, and held him still in her deathly strong grip. The vampire captured his bottom lip between her own and began sucking gently, forcing blood to well up out of the little pricks. 

Any further protest died instantly as her lower body began gyrating, her pussy squeezing him rhythmically along his entire length. He'd never felt anything quite like it, his whole cock encased in velvet soft pleasure, being milked with the sort of strength he'd come to expect from her on the training mats. 

He was going to cum. There was no way around it. Even as she sucked his blood and held him paralysed in her thrall, he could feel an unstoppable orgasm rising inside him. His cock was thickening, his tummy tense. He was being ridden into oblivion by a half-millennium old vampire courtesan. How was any nineteen-year-old supposed to deal with that? She was barely even thrusting, only coming about an inch off of him as she writhed her hips about in a tight circle. It was like she was trying to tie a knot in his cock. 

"Relax, young one, let me have it," she released his beleaguered lip to croon directly into his ear, her fingers stroking lovingly through his wet hair. She nibbled his lobe teasingly as she worked his cock over, breathing heavily in exertion. "I'm close too, you feel so good." 

It was true, his cock was rubbing absolutely every surface in her experienced cunt. Pleasure was rising rapidly as she squeezed down with her internal muscles in a practiced rhythm. He was so god damn big, her cervix was taking a pounding from his fat, apple-like head. Mashing the two spongy tissues against each other was a sensation she was growing to appreciate very much. She pushed down hard, forcing them both to distend. A quiver of unadulterated pleasure raced up her spine, arching her back, mashing her chest further into his. She wasn't supposed to be losing control like this, but he just felt too good, stirring her insides into a flurry. 

He gave an involuntary shudder, was she as close to losing control as he was? His cock twitched, swelling. She was breathing hard into his ear, kissing, holding him close. He was only seconds away, she circled her hips faster. She was right, he'd never been fucked like this before 

"Yes! Oh, Fuck!" he cried out, his release upon him. The bloodthirsty daemonette mounting him only hummed happily in response. 

His orgasm crested, seed rushing up the length of his shaft. Her writhing pussy didn't stop as the first great salvo of batter shot point-blank into her cervix. He could tell she was enjoying the sensation by the way she began screaming into his ear in fluent Russian. He relaxed into the wonderful sensation of seeding her, releasing great shuddering pulses deep inside her furnace-hot cunt. She came apart above him, forced into her own climax by the magic in his semen. A smug, happy grin grew on his face. She might have him trapped, outclass him when it came to sexual skill but she still couldn't handle his pleasure-inducing spunk. 

Lillian couldn't believe what was happening in the depths of her gushing nethers. His seed felt like it was scalding her, spurting forth again and again from his thick weapon. She felt every magic-rich throb as her pink insides cried out their joy to the rest of her body. His seed set every cell alight with bliss. She only barely had the fortitude to keep rotating her hips as a monster of an orgasm reared up and devoured her from the inside. In the throes of ecstasy, a silly thought crossed her addled mind. Which was better, his seed or his blood? Good thing she didn't have to choose, she had both. 

Their combined fluids, with nowhere to go, sluiced around their snug coupling. They oozed over his thighs and balls, down into the tub below as his last few shots finally splattered against the gates of her womb. Her heaving body shuddered to a halt, gulping down great gasps of breath. 

"God damn, I fuck like a goddess!" she chuckled into his beleaguered bottom lip as she kissed him. 

She leaned back a little to look in his conflicted, deep-blue eyes, her fingers releasing the tufts of blond hair she'd held in a death grip through her climax. Her lips descended onto his again, tenderly this time, thanking him. He had resurrected her, given his precious blood to save her. Even now, as she tried to dominate and subjugate him for her own, he gave his wonderful magic so generously. It was too much. She hadn't felt this satisfied in... well probably since she'd been turned vampire, all those centuries ago. 

Her inner beast purred contentedly, curling up around the ball of magic in her core. The black in her eyes swirled, morphing back to their normal, beautiful hazel. She shivered, claws retracting as he tamed her with a heavy dose of post-coital bliss. 

"Oh, young one, that was simply marvellous," she whispered, laying her head to rest on his shoulder. 

"So, it's not just my blood you're after then?" he asked cockily. 

"Mmmhh... Yes, I want your precious seed, too. It was better than I'd even dreamed, Chris," there was no trace of guile in her voice. It was a potent blend, his blood and his seed. Her vampiric parasite was going to be busy for hours digesting his rich offering. 

As she hugged him close, murmuring and cooing happy little nothings against his neck, Chris felt the magic of her venom waning. He lay there in the tatters of his nice clothes, biding his time. 

The water she'd washed him with was cooling but her skin was warm against his, his cum gluing them together. Her slushy, cream-filled pussy twitched hungrily around his sensitive cock every now and then, her body shuddering in little aftershocks. His sticky cum was reluctantly leaking from her, lathering their hot, moist coupling. He had to agree with her that it probably was a good thing vampires were sterile with the amount she'd managed to coax out of him. Regardless, he hadn't had a chance to bite her with his itch yet. It would be some poetic fucking justice when he did though. 

Despite his initial fear of her startling behaviour, dead eyes, and paralysing bites, he couldn't deny the surge of satisfaction he felt after having her. This was what he'd wanted, wasn't it? Yes. It was just a bit of a shock to wake up paralysed. That was steadily changing as the seconds ticked by. If she didn't bite him again in the next few minutes, he was confident he could regain control of the situation. The way she was cuddling into him he wouldn't be surprised if she settled down for a little nap. He couldn't help rejoicing inside, relieved that she was alive and kicking after such a grievous wound. 

Her vampiric side was obviously quite a possessive beast, but it seemed she could be satisfied into recession. He was sure that once she was back in control of herself, Lillian would be more reasonable about joining his brood rather than whatever kidnapping scheme she'd hatched while he was out cold. If she wasn't? After how she'd just used him, he could think of several choice punishments to inflict on her. Perhaps punishment wasn't the right word. 

His finger twitched, nerves testing their connections to muscles. Not long now. He smiled and sniffed her hair, appreciating her honeyed scent unabashedly for the first time. His cock was still hard as a brick inside her. He sighed, of course her venom held him at an almost painful state of readiness. Magic, reliable in its absurdity. He gave it an experimental flex, making her lush body jump slightly. She grunted cutely into his neck, trying to burrow further into him. What a strange transformation, from hissing beast to mewling, affectionate lover. It didn't matter, she was about to get it. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 10|
--------------------------------------------
Her admission of being a prostitute when she was a human still shocked him. He didn't doubt it for a second after the ride she'd just given him. She'd never really talked about her past. He couldn't comprehend living for half a century like she had. All those memories, how did she keep track of it? She must think him a child. He supposed he still was, compared to her. 

His powerful thigh muscles bunched in momentary spasm, his nerve connections resetting. He was going to fucking pound her. She'd jacked his cock up on whatever was in her venom, he was going to give it right back. He wanted to hear her scream in pleasure, beg him for more, beg him to stop, he didn't care. He wanted her to be sore and tender in the morning, walking around gingerly so everyone would know that he'd ruined her. She'd said he could have her however he wanted. He was going to put it to the test. 

His cock throbbed angrily in anticipation, worked up by his little fantasies. Now or never. He stealthily reached for the feeling of the Ether, steeling himself for his pounce. He knew exactly how fast she could be. Surprise was going to be key. He took a slow, deep breath, gently tensing each of his major muscle groups to see if they responded. He smiled wickedly, turning to plant a little kiss against the damp skin of her temple. 

Lillian felt his lips, such a tender gesture. In all her fantasies she'd never really considered getting all lovey-dovey with him but it would be so easy. Then, without warning, her world turned upside down. 

She yelped in shock, clinging around his neck as they fell into nothing, twisting. A momentary grey glimpse of Ether light was her only clue what he was doing. She was too startled from her dozy sex-haze to resist as he merged back, standing next to the tub with her impaled on his huge cock. 

A bestial snarl met her as she looked up at him. Purple rippled across his skin. Taloned fingers quickly captured great fistfuls of her ass, holding her suspended on him none too gently. The dragon. Her heart pounded in both fright and exhilaration. She tried to reach inside and bring her own nature forward again in reply. The stupid creature was still gnawing at the magic he'd deposited in her core, barely even raising its head to her call for help. Then she was distracted as she felt his cock reshape inside her, lengthening ever so slightly, his glans thickening and becoming more pointed, ready to pierce her. Oh god. 

Chris' legs had almost given way as he merged back into the Norm, but triggering his transformation seemed to help cleanse the last of her paralytic from his system. Power welled up from deep inside as he and his dragon embraced into their magnificent hybrid form. She looked so startled, it was almost cute but he wasn't fooled. He knew exactly what lurked inside her now. 

He took a lunging step forward with his considerable strength, then another, tackling her into the bathroom wall. A dull thump resounded as the drywall caved in around her ass and lower back, little crumbs of the brittle white material falling onto the tiled floor. 

The air in her lungs evacuated in a hoarse moan, leaving her winded. The dragon's cock smashed painfully into her already tender cervix, his momentum coming to an abrupt halt, her body taking the brunt. 

He didn't give her any time to recover, crowding her lush frame into the ruined wall, crushing her tits against his chest. Thank fuck he hadn't hit a stud. Pinned and breathless, Lillian only gave paltry resistance as he released his grip on her big rump and hooked her legs over his bulging arms. He spread her wide, elbows under her knees, as she gulped down air like a beached goldfish. 

"Chris, wait..." was all the objection she managed. He shouldn't have been able to move at all for hours yet, she'd pumped that much of her paralytic venom into his bloodstream while he was out. 

His pièce de résistance came in the form of his great purple wings reaching forward around his body. The strong ridge of muscle and bone at the leading edge of the great leathery membranes quickly hooked under her widespread knees and tracked upwards on the wall. 

"Fuck! No, you're too big!" she screeched breathlessly in protest, beginning to thrash about in distress as he used both sets of limbs to raise her legs until they couldn't go any further. Her knees were up by her ears, and her ass had come off the wall when he finally let up. It felt like she was doing the splits and being folded in half at the same time, her huge breasts the filling of a vampire sandwich. Her thighs trembled, and her snug channel tightened down on his rampant erection as he tested her flexibility to the limit. 

She bared her fangs in challenge at his rough treatment. Her arms, still wrapped around his neck, tightened with unholy strength, reeling him back into reach. If she could just bite him... 

He reared his hips back, his monolithic cock pulling against her clinging insides roughly. She cried wordlessly in a mixture of pleasure and pain. It felt like he was going to turn her inside out, if her pussy could have sulked, she would have. Her grip on his neck slackened in surrender. For all she'd ridden his cock with abandon, she wasn't quite ready to be fucked by it and he knew it. The threat was clear. Behave, or things would get rougher. 

When the ridge of his throbbing glans had just popped out of her hot sheath, he had the nerve to tease her, rocking back and forth barely an inch or more. He was fucking her with just his fat cockhead. Her enflamed labia were hard pressed to handle such treatment. Spread wide by his prodigious girth, they were pulled outwards and pushed inside her repeatedly with his shallow strokes. It was torture, but the way her throbbing clitoris was being bumped had merits of its own. Not to mention how the sensitive tissues on the roof of her vagina were being meticulously stimulated by his pronounced coronal ridge. 

She whimpered, mounting pleasure draining her will to struggle. Her body squirmed weakly, pinned between his massive hybrid form and the wall. Distracted by the first stirrings of a climax, she was lulled into the rhythm of his shallow thrusts. His teasing was starting to feel really good. 

Without warning he plunged all the way back inside her, butting the end of her passage as his heavy balls thudded into her springy buttocks. A great dam of pleasure burst in her ravaged core, flooding her entire being. Her body began convulsing and finally, she did squeal. For the right man, she squealed like the slutty little sow she knew she was. This was the right man and her body was letting him know all about it. 

Chris felt something hot splatter against his balls and thighs, even dripping down onto his feet. He chuckled against the side of her flabbergasted, flushed face, kissing her rosy cheek. He'd never had a woman squirt on him before. Maybe she'd just lost control of her bladder in the moment, but he didn't care. He was occupied enjoying the frantic fluttering of her molten pussy. Jesus, she had some strong muscles in there. 

"You cocky little fucking stud!" she cried, her brown eyes wide with shock and pleasure. "Fuck me, Chris. Right now! Fuck me as hard as you god damn can!" 

He growled at her challenge and pushed his clawed wingtips through the wall, locking them in place. He didn't care about the damage, the wall was fucked anyway, he wanted his hands free. As her legs were already spread as high and wide as possible, his wings pressing up against the back of her knees was all he needed to hold her, suspended and trapped. 

He reared his hand back and delivered a punishing spank to her wide rump. 

"What are you... how? Oh fuck!" she moaned as she realised her predicament. Short of using her incredible strength in a pitch to struggle free, he had her pinned, their previous positions reversed. With his rigid cock bringing her off so masterfully, she wasn't sure if she even wanted to break free. 

"I'm doing the fucking now, vampire," he hissed dangerously between his sharp teeth. "And I'll decide exactly when, how, and where I fuck you. That was the deal, wasn't it? If you want my blood?" 

She squirmed haughtily, full to the brim of dragon cock, considering her options. The beginnings of a snarl curled the corner of her plump lips. She didn't like her own words being used against her. 

He slapped her other buttock for good measure and squeezed the juicy flesh, hard. 

"Yes!" she croaked as her ass smarted painfully. Her pussy creamed and a great shudder ran through her body. His rough treatment was like dropping napalm bombs on an already burning forest. Complete overkill. "Fine, yes, that was the deal!" 

"Good," he dodged his head forward and stole a peck against her lips. "I'm going to fuck you slow, Lillian. What happens after that will depend on your good behaviour." 

"Shut up and do it!" her body shivered at the thought. Where was this coming from? How could the kid push her buttons so well? 

Whack! She whimpered as he struck her again. She gushed a little of her clear fluid as her womanhood spasmed in approval. 

He withdrew from her clutching depths slowly and pushed back in all the way to his root. 

"I am going to fuck you like I'm paying for it, Lillian. I'm going to get my money's worth. I bet you were worth every cent anyone ever paid for you." He thrust slow but hard, watching her incredible breasts quake, grinding his crown against her cervix each time. 

"I was! I'll be worth every drop of blood you feed me, too. I'm going to be your personal whore, Chris!" His cock was doing terribly wonderful things to her. 

He smiled at her promise and placed a hand on her soft tummy. Contorted as she was, her belly had several little rolls of fatty padding which he found incredibly endearing. He pushed her firmly back towards the wall. Space opened between their bodies. This put even more strain on her quivering thighs. She shut her eyes and bumped her head back into the wall, hissing as she tried to accept his punishment, breathing through it. 

He didn't even allow her that, reaching up to grab a fistful of her dark, sweaty hair close to the roots. His grip was used to direct her gaze down at their coupling. 

"Look at us, Lillian. Watch me fuck you," he whispered darkly into her ear even as he tightened his hold, tugging wonderfully at her roots across most of her scalp. She loved it when a man knew how to treat her hair properly and wasn't afraid to do so. 

It was hard. Her tits rose and fell with each of his slow, powerful thrusts. Between her cleavage, she caught glimpses of his immense penis sluicing in and out of her. He was glistening with clear juices and white flecks of the cum he'd already pumped her full of. Her pink labia were struggling on valiantly and he looked fucking absurd when he pulled most of the way out. He held their heads together, kissing below her ear and scenting her sweaty skin. 

Chris was incensed by the view. Her voluptuous thighs, wide hips, and relatively slim waist screamed at the dragon that she was perfect breeding stock. That wasn't even mentioning the most spectacular pair of breasts in existence. She was absolutely built for it, a perfect, full bodied goddess. He wanted to watch her tummy swell with his growing child. 

"You're so fucking beautiful, Lillian," he murmured reverently, watching his cock pistoning into her clinging furnace. He was really beginning to puff now, using his dragon strength to make her big body hitch up the wall with each mighty thrust. Next cycle, he paused at full depth, mashing their slick pubic bones together with a tight circle of his hips. 

"Fff.. fucking... fuck!" she cried as he resumed his measured rutting. 

It was all too much. His hot breath, the sensation of their bodies pressed together, her welling emotions, his rich blood, her quivering womanhood, his perfect cock. A quiet little orgasm rocked her to the core. It was incredibly gentle physically, but sent her emotions thrashing about like the ocean under a tropical cyclone. 

"I hope you made your choice to save me wisely," her choked whisper brought him up short, her happy little clam sucking and pulling at his big pecker. Her sudden change of tone had him concerned. Perhaps it was all just a ploy to regain dominance in their little sexual feud but he cared for her too much to risk being callous. 

"What's wrong, Lillian? Of course I did. Don't you remember what I said when we were dancing? I want you, Lillian," he released his grip on her hair and tucked it tenderly behind her ear to look into her beautiful eyes. There was red fluid brimming at the corners. 

"Oh god, you're so young, Chris. You're binding me with every climax but how can this ever work?" 

He snorted, then chuckled. Watching confusion and a little indignation play across her beautifully sex-flushed features. 

"That's easy, Lillian. We both have feelings for each other. Those are genuine, at least on my part," he teased. "We're going to keep having nasty, debaucherous sex and my magic is going to take care of the rest. If we trust each other and talk through our issues, we'll still be going strong a couple thousand years from now." 

"Promise me!" she glared, feeling incredibly vulnerable. "I'll fucking hunt you down if you leave me." 

"I promise. But Lillian, we need trust and honesty. I'm never going to leave my brood, but I would love you to join us." 

The pause grew long as she considered. Their tingling sexes were eager for the resumption of glorious friction. 

"Yes," she finally nodded acceptance, her bearing slumping. "It's going to be a bit of a strange transition but I want to, Chris. I just get so possessive sometimes. Your blood does some serious shit to my vampire." 

"Good." He kissed her nose affectionately. "I'll keep you plump and happy, you'll never go hungry." 

They stared at each other for a moment before kissing tenderly. She squirmed a little, still spread-eagled on his rampant cock, her arms entwined around his neck. It was several minutes before they came up for air and their kissing wasn't nearly as tender. 

She shoved his head down into the vast expanse of her perfect tits, guiding him to her large nipples with tugs on his ears and coos of delight when he laved and nibbled her tender buds. Her skin was still covered with traces of his drying seed but he couldn't care less. 

He brought his hands into play, hefting and kneading reverently. Her pale, vein-latticed boobs looked so sinfully perfect spilling out of his big, purple hands. He soon learned that she liked it a lot when he traced his talons delicately over her flesh or burrowed his face under her big jugs and sucked at the soft skin there. With his cock skewering her to the wall they explored exactly how sensitive her magnificent breasts could become. It wasn't long before she couldn't take it anymore. 

"Let me down, Chris, I need to make love to you," her soft tone whispered of untold delights. 

"Not a fucking chance," he rumbled into the soft skin of her neck, easing his cock tenderly in and out of her. "You've been so well behaved, but I know what you really want, Lillian." 

"Is that so?" she cocked an eyebrow at him. "You've got a lot to learn, young one." 

He surged forward, his thrusts suddenly kicked up into 12<sup>th</sup> gear. 

Her eyes bugged out and she let out an inhuman shriek as he began jackhammering her into the wall. Her vagina fluttered in protest for the short span of five thrusts from his giant dragon cock before seizing like an overheated engine. Her lush frame shook violently as her shriek died into a gurgling hiss of pleasure. Clear fluid splattered and dripped over his balls and thighs again, leaking from her overstuffed cunt to splash the wall with in an obscene wet streak. 

Ten minutes later, as his cock still slammed into her with all the might his powerful body could muster, she had to admit he'd been right. He knew exactly what she needed. 

Even though she'd told him she could handle absolutely everything he could give her, he'd had to be coaxed and reassured that he wasn't going to hurt her. He'd finally ramped up to the pelvis shattering strokes he was currently giving her, bringing her off twice already in the process. She'd screamed his praises for the whole city to hear each time, raking her claws across his tough, tiny scales. In retaliation, he'd roughly mauled every feminine curve her lush body had to offer. It only drove her to loftier heights of pleasure. The boy-dragon could fuck like a god, it was perfect. 

Her vampire had finally awoken when he really began throwing down the righteous dicking. He'd offered her his shoulder and she dined on his delectable blood once again, that had triggered her latest climax. There was no way she was going to paralyse him in the midst of such glorious, sweaty fucking so she simply enjoyed the loving ruin of her body, sex, and mind. 

They were both huffing and puffing now. Their inflamed sexes squelched lewdly, their bodies clapping together in the unmistakable rhythm of sex. It was incredible to be so full yet fucked so powerfully. Lillian would never admit it but she hoped he would cum soon. Full of blood, drowned in pleasure, she felt like she could curl up on top of him and sleep for weeks after they were done. 

Chris was close, it was such a turn on to have her incredible body at his mercy, submitting to his youthful whims and ministrations. He couldn't believe how she took all he had and only cried out for more. After his final transformation and growth spurt, he'd resigned himself to forever holding back in the bedroom. Not with Lillian. 

His cock was throbbing, spitting runny precum to mix with her copious juices and leak down over them. She was hot and tight and oh-so-wet. His dick was in heaven, shuttling back and forth inside her, covered in a slick froth of their fluids. His feet were getting slippery on the tiled floor. They'd made such a mess, he was losing the precious traction he needed for his long-dicked thrusts into her salacious, clinging cunt. 

He wanted to be on top of her. 

He paused mid stroke in her greasy sheath, panting for breath. Sweat was pouring off him, his muscles quivering as they tried to recover from the gruelling performance he'd demanded of them. 

"No! Don't stop now, Chris, no more teasing. I need you," Her finger traced lovingly through his sweat-damp purple hair, her building pleasure put on pause. She clenched down with her tired pussy, milking his beautiful cock, desperate to receive his seed once again. 

"I'm going to slip over in your puddle if I don't move, Lillian. Jesus, you're the messier than Susan. Such a piglet." He kissed across the flawless, rosy skin of her clavicle, trailing up towards her ear. His tongue tasted her skin, sampling her scent and salty sweat. 

"It's a defence mechanism, you bastard," she sassed breathlessly. "You're tearing me up with that thing Chris, my poor cunt is just trying keep everything nice and moist for you." 

"Bullshit, you love every second," he nipped her earlobe cheekily. 

"You know I do, young one," she smiled indulgently. "Now for the love of god shut up and get back to work. This pussy isn't going to fuck itself." 

"Yes, Madam," he smirked. "Hold on." 

He supported her weight by cupping the gloriously glowing cheeks of her full-bodied rump and pulled his wings gingerly from under her knees. Both winced as muscles relaxed for the first time over half an hour. 

He lowered them towards the floor, never withdrawing from her warmth. She gasped as he laid her down on the cold tiles but he silenced her protest with a passionate kiss, their tongues careful in the dangerous environment of their sharp mouths. 

Lillian wrapped her legs up around his waist, spurring him back into action with little giddy-up kicks to his butt. She stroked down his spine with gentle fingers, exploring the larger scales there and sending delightful shivers up his neck.

--------------------------------------------
"Hurry up, Chris," the beautiful brunette complained, breaking their kiss. 

"Alright, cowgirl," he hilted himself back inside her tailor-made passage with a lecherous grin. A tingle of magic stirred at the base of his cock as he began fucking her again. 

"Oooooo! I love that cock. You're making this old whore so happy." 

"You're my whore, Lillian!" It came out as a possessive growl. He thrust again, his cock wrapped up tight in her hot, oily tissues. 

"Ungghh! Yes! Dah! Dah! Your whore, your whore, your whore," she chanted as his hips worked back into a quick rhythm. 

He began plunging inside her, hunching his entire body into her plush femininity, making her curvy figure jiggle enticingly. His hips were powering into her upturned thighs with loud slaps. His cock filled her completely, heavy testes bouncing on her ass with every thrust. At the crest of each stroke, he made a tiny grind of his hips, stirring her juicy inside. His fat cockhead kissed perfectly against her cervix each and every time. He had to close his eyes and grit his teeth against the mounting sensation of energy gathering in his groin and lower abdomen. This was going to be a huge one and his dragon knew just where to put it. It was just a shame she couldn't bear his child. 

"I told you not to hold back, Chris. Use me! Fuck me like you wish you could fuck Annabel...Oh...shit... Fuck, I'm going to cum again!" 

His abdomen began to tense violently as his dragon pulled more and more magic from their deep reserve. He could barely hold it in as his cock swelled and hardened in final blissful anticipation. That pre-orgasmic ecstasy welled up strong in the base of his cock. He was having trouble maintaining his thrusts it felt so good. It didn't matter now though; his climax was unstoppable. 

"Yes! Bozhe moi, you're getting bigger. You know where I want it, dragon!" She cried out beneath him, his swelling cock bringing her closer and closer to her own orgasm. 

"Fuck! Yes!" 

His fangs tingled, bitter fluid dripping in his mouth. Instinct told him to bite her with his itch, seal their bond and plant his seed in her fertile womb. Only she wasn't fertile. Fuck it, what harm could it do? 

He hunched forward one last time as a great shudder rocked his body. His big, hard-working testes shuddered, drawing upward as his whole groin trembled in blissful release. Thick, potent dragon-cum raced up his huge shaft as he sunk his fangs into her flushed, perfect skin. He growled in absolute satisfaction as he fulfilled his biological imperative. 

"Aaaeeeiii!" she squealed for the third time that night. His magic-infused seed erupted against her cervix even as his fangs pierced the soft flesh just above her tit. She was dimly aware of the hot, alien sensation of his itch racing towards her womb but it was hard to concentrate as his spunk continued to hose violently against her pink, tender insides. 

Even as she fell into the throes of an incredible climax, her body flushed hotter as his powerful venom took hold in her womb and tried to work its magic. Her cunt was attempting to eject his great spitting spear it was squeezing so hard. There was so much magic, so much sticky cum. She'd thought his previous offering had been excessive, this was downright insane. He was going to overload her. 

"Fuck! Stop! Stop! Pull out you're going to... AAHHHHHH!" 

His hips plunged a last little bit forward, his pointed tip finding her cervical opening with unnerving accuracy and barging in. She shrieked, thrashing wildly as his sticky semen began flooding up into her defunct uterus. It felt boiling hot inside her, almost scalding. Then it finally mixed with the magic of his itch and her consciousness shattered. 

She wasn't fully aware of what was going on after that first salvo of his thick cream blasted directly into her womb. Her mind drifted gently in a sea of placid bliss. It was surreal. She observed their mating bodies as if from on high. Her inner beast was demure and quiet, almost reverent as the dragon tried his very best to spark the miracle of life inside her barren abdomen. For the first time, Lillian felt sadness that she couldn't bear children. He was trying so hard. She would love to do that for him. 

Chris teetered on the brink of delirium too. His cock squirted pulse after pulse of potent cum up into her womb. He fought to keep her prised open with his spitting glans as she squealed incoherently and bucked beneath him. Her body wasn't accustomed to being loaded up with energy like this but he would soon change that. He hadn't really meant to push into her cervix, it was sort of just a natural reaction these days. Fuck it felt good though, his seed and magic draining through his throbbing cock in huge gratifying geysers, his whole body shuddering in sympathy. He hadn't come like this since that first time with Petra several months ago. He must have put close to a litre in her by now, it was insane. 

There was just something incredible about trying his hardest to impregnate his partner. But she couldn't. Jesus, was it going to be like this intense with Lillian every time? He smiled stupidly against her skin, he almost hoped it would be. 

He released his bite almost sheepishly to look up at her sweaty face. Her head was lolling from side to side, her vagina still milking him. He could feel her legs trembling around his hips and grinned, she was just fine. 

His climax was finally winding down, a few last ropes of sperm-laden jizm pulsing up his tingling, over-sensitive cock. It didn't find anywhere to go, her womb was already swollen beyond capacity, inundated with billions of his determined little swimmers and enough magic to destroy a small town. His unneeded cum seeped out around their coupling. Thick and white, it dribbled over her puckered anus to slop onto the tiles in great globs. 

Complete satisfaction, he sighed in blissful, post coital relief. Lillian was alive! She was his and they'd just had incredible sex. 

He was wiped out. That was a lot of energy even for him. He just wanted to curl up on a soft bed with her and cuddle his way into a deep sleep. Reluctantly, he gently began pulling his cock from her enflamed pussy. He was finally beginning to soften. 

"No, please," she murmured, eyes fluttering open. 

"Hi," he smiled, pausing with half his length still inside her. "Welcome back." 

"Don't be a shit," was her tired response. "Roll us over please, Chris. Good lord, now I know what Susan is always complaining about." 

"Okay, hold on." 

Chris was half way through executing said post-coital roll when she cried out in wordless alarm. 

"Lillian, what's wrong?" he gripped her tighter. 

Something stirred inside her. 

Her hazel eyes bulged huge, pupils dilated, unbelieving. The cry had died in her throat, leaving her mouth open in silent astonishment. Her fangs looked sort of cute like that, he decided. 

Something writhed. Something... heaved. The air left her lungs in a deep grunt, it felt like something punched her in the gut. There was a battle raging in her... <em>oh god, he couldn't</em>. Her eyes darted, searched his worried countenance, desperate for something, anything. Any sign that he knew what he'd done to her. Something pulsed, warm, delicate, and very much alive. 

Deep inside her, his indomitable magic sank into one of her ancient, dead ova. The parasitic vampire germ inside was helpless to resist. Magic infused the large cell, enriching and swelling it with a flood of life energy even as the strongest of his frantic sperm finally broke through that final barrier to discharge its triumphant genetic payload. 

It was Chris' turn to shout his confused shock. An all too familiar wave of energy blasted into his awareness. It was so powerful, stripping him of his senses to lay sprawled on the floor with her in disbelief. 

The impossibility shook his magical being to the very foundation like some huge earthquake. Epicentre, her tummy. His dragon wanted to both cower and crow, knowing that what they had just wrought should not possible but wanting to roar his triumph to anyone who would listen nonetheless. 

"What have you done?" she whispered accusingly, a hand instinctively moving over her belly button. 

"The impossible, apparently," he murmured back, still not believing what he'd felt. 

Utterly exhausted, neither of them felt inclined to move. That was how they were found five minutes later when Reyla barged in to investigate. A dragon and a vampire entwined in a sticky mess of limbs, wings, and drywall rubble. 

The elf wasn't happy. 

*** 

Three soft raps sounded against the door. Chris had been dozing lazily but felt Lillian stiffen on top of him before the tentative knock began. Her senses were very keen despite her relaxed state. Chris watched her head rise from his shoulder momentarily to listen. Satisfied that there wasn't a threat, she wriggled contentedly, enjoying the feeling of their still filthy bodies sandwiched together. 

"Come in," Chris said. 

Light streamed into Lillian's dark room from the living area and Annabel's slim outline slipped inside, shutting the door behind herself and plunging them back into complete dark. 

Annabel couldn't see a thing in the pitch black of the vampire's shuttered bedroom. She'd caught a glimpse of their bodies under a sheet on Lillian's bed and took a tentative step forward, feeling her way in the darkness. 

"Guys?" she asked when her knees touched the edge of the bed. 

Lillian instinctively let out a quiet hiss of warning at the proximity of the girl, a potential rival. 

"Here, Dee," Chris reached over to take her hand. He guided her to lie next to them on top of the covers. She was tense, so he stroked her forearm reassuringly. 

"What did Reyla say?" Chris asked, caressing abstract patterns on the vampire's lower back with his other hand, appreciating the feel of the adorable little dimples he'd discovered there. He ignored her possessive behaviour, this was nothing. 

She'd practically attacked Reyla when the elf barged in on them in the bathroom. It hadn't been the best of timing to confront the confused, vulnerable vampire with antagonism. He'd had to forcibly restrain her. Reyla had been lucky to escape with nothing but a bruised ego, managing to just raise a barrier charm before Lillian had crashed into her. The force had still knocked the elf on her slim ass rather painfully before Chris had restrained the spitting mad vampire. Then he'd put her over his shoulder and dragged her off to her room past the startled members of his brood. 

"Well, I think she's mostly surprised. We all are, Chris. We discussed Susan pretending to be pregnant instead of Lillian but that wouldn't buy us much more than a month at most. People would see through it too easily with magic and Lillian would have to disappear. I said she wasn't going to want to leave you." She yawned, it was going to be dawn in just over an hour and she hadn't slept at all tonight. 

"That wouldn't go down well. Would it, my cantankerous vampire?" he joked. 

"No," Lillian kissed the well-defined pectoral muscle she was resting on. 

"That leaves us with two options. Go to ground, or own it," Annabel continued. "Michelle's gone to bed, she's got stuff to do tomorrow. Before she packed it in, she said we can't disappear after the attack at the club. People saw you so she gave your name to the police and media. I watched the reports showing on the East Coast early news, the details are pretty light but you're coming across as some sort of hero." 

"Jesus," Chris muttered grumpily, raising his hand to squeeze the bridge of his nose in frustration. "That's just what I need." 

"So, we have to come out about my pregnancy?" Lillian asked. 

"Yes, I think so. Are you okay, Lillian?" Annabel asked. 

"Never better," the vampire was honestly content. "I'm free of Reyla, gorged on blood, and sexed to the limit. As for everything else there doesn't seem to be much we can do right now." 

"What about, you know... the baby?" his first asked tentatively. "Reyla said something about a prophecy and ran off to her library to do some research." 

"Ah, yes. Everyone assumed it was the bogus ramblings of a blood-starved ancient vampire. I did too, right up until I felt Chris force life into existence in my belly. I don't even know what the old fool said but everyone will be trying to find the meaning there now," She paused, raising her head from his chest to look down at the young man in the dark. Her vampire's vision let her read his concern clearly. "Whatever happens, whatever you are, I will treasure carrying your child, Chris. You've awakened something I didn't know I was missing." 

Chris stiffened perceptively, his heart beginning to thump louder as adrenaline crept into his bloodstream. His hand stilled its caress on her lower back. 

"What do you mean 'whatever he is', Lillian?" Annabel queried, it seemed like an odd thing to say and the silence following the vampire's statement made her uneasy. 

"He isn't just a dragon," Lillian stated matter-of-factly. 

"Well, yeah, he's part human too." 

"That's not what I mean," the vampire explained. "There's something else in there. It's ancient. I can taste it in his blood. It all makes sense. His magic, how he knocked up Petra and Claire back to back... how he knocked me up. You don't understand, Annabel, it should be impossible." 

"Chris?" Annabel meeped, reaching out to touch the membrane of one of his folded wings where it lay on the bed next to her. Chris was far from normal, she knew that from the beginning. There had to be a reason. 

"Well, I don't fucking know," he finally sighed defensively. "There's only one thing I can think of that might have anything to do with this." 

Annabel, with her infinite wisdom of his feelings and moods simply kept trailing her soft touch over the little bones in his wing-fingers. She waited patiently for him to continue. 

When he spoke, both women listened intently as he retold his bizarre encounter with the mysterious, alien visitor on the day of his first full transformation. He told them of the strange images it showed him. Its ability to simply look inside him and understand everything. Its frustration with his lack of understanding. That it had done something to him at his conception. He explained how he had been trying desperately to study both magic and science in an attempt to comprehend its convoluted message. 

They were silent when he was finished. 

"See, it doesn't explain anything, just opens up a boat load more questions," he was frustrated with his lack of progress. 

"This is important, young one. You were right to keep this to yourself," Lillian finally said. "It will be better if everyone thinks you're simply a powerful dragon. It isn't a lie, just not the whole truth. We're going to be under the microscope from now on. All your other magical quirks and achievements can be explained away but impregnating me will draw serious attention. Reyla may only be able to help us, if she would decide to help you. I don't know if you should tell her or not." 

"She has a right to know," Annabel said. "Despite being a bit bitchy, she's done a lot for us. Who knows, if we tell her she might be able to figure it out. I'm sorry I didn't take this more seriously the first time you told me, Chris." 

"It's okay," he reassured her. 

"Don't mistake Reyla's help for being a selfless act, Annabel," Lillian warned from her warm perch on top of the dragon. "She is always calculating, playing an angle. She would take Chris from you if she thought she could." 

"I think we should tell her, I need help on this," Chris blurted. "We should tell Reyla and the other women but keep it at that for now." 

"Okay. What about Hailey? And Michelle?" Annabel asked. 

"Michelle, yes. Hailey... wait," Lillian weighed in. 

"Why Michelle?" Annabel said. 

"She's keeping the humans on our side," the vampire explained. "The more I've been talking to her these last months, the more I've come to respect her. She's is a strategic thinker with a huge influence on human policy to do with the Revelation. It goes against my instinct to allow Chris to gain public image but she's right about the amount of social and political influence it will reel in. She needs to know the full picture so she can guide us in the right direction with the humans." 

"That makes sense, I guess," Annabel agreed a little reluctantly, yawned, and continued. "We'll wait with Hailey until you two make it official." 

"Thank you both," Chris kissed into Lillian's hair then pulled Annabel closer to repeat the loving gesture. "I can't tell you how good it feels to finally have someone understand how strange that encounter with the presence was. It's been looming over me for months." 

"It's okay, babe, we'll figure this out," Annabel snuggled closer to his warmth, inadvertently bumping Lillian in the darkness. "Sorry." 

"It's fine," the vampire only felt the tiniest flicker of possessiveness as the girl curled up against the dragon's side. Strange. Anyone else and she'd be fighting not to attack... his magic, she realised. Here she was, impregnated and reduced to a willing little leg-spreader just like the rest of his flock. Why did it feel so perfect then? 

"Um... Lillian?" Annabel whispered. 

With her enhanced vision, Lillian could see the hopeful, almost desperate look on the young woman's face as she prepared to ask something. 

"Yes?" 

"Do you think I could... can I sleep in here tonight? Just sleep, I don't want to..." 

"Yes," Lillian saved her from babbling. "Just don't complain if the bed starts rocking in the night." 

"Oh, um... Thanks. I'll only be a few hours, I've got to go to a practical class and I have to get to it at ten am." 

"Good night, you two. I love you," The dragon was incredibly content with his two beauties cosying up to him for the night. Annabel was in some comfy house clothes and obviously very tired with all the yawning he'd seen. He simply wrapped an arm and a wing around her and lay back on the plush pillows. Lillian's relaxed, naked warmth on top of him was comforting after their ordeal. Fatigue both physical and magical were pulling him down into a deep ocean of sleep like some great weight wrapped around his ankles. Still, it was a pleasant feeling. He was soon purring lightly through his purple snout, dead to the world. 

Annabel was out for the count too, but Lillian lay awake, mulling over his words. He had meant his love for Annabel. Hadn't he? A delightfully hopeful little shiver ran down her spine at the thought he might have meant her too. She snorted softly. Jesus, she was turning into a demure little broodmare, wasn't she? 

*** 

Chris watched from behind the one-way glass as Michelle dissected the man's story piece by piece. Leaning back in the chair, he remembered being in that exact position, cuffed and helpless. Thankfully, the leader of last night's unsuccessful kidnapping wasn't wearing an explosive collar like he had been. The man was human, there was no need. Besides, his arm was in a cast. 

Hot, slow breath goosed the hairs of his neck. Lillian pricked him gently with her fangs so that only a tiny droplet of blood wept out to be collected by her greedy pink tongue. 

"Cut it out, Lillian," he complained weakly as she nibbled the skin at the base of his neck. 

Hovering behind him inside her transparency spell, her response was a barely audible titter of mirth and an invisible hand snaking around his front to caress and squeeze his hardening cock through the material of his jeans. 

Tim Garril turned his head to frown at the vampire's antics. 

Lillian relented under the old elemental's disapproval, sort of. She released his pulsing member and instead draped herself across his shoulders, her soft breasts moulding obscenely around his neck as she began lovingly running her hands through his hair. Her hot tongue traced the shell of his ear, sparking a shiver down his spine, forcing him to sit up straight as an arrow.

--------------------------------------------
Thankfully, the three non-magical humans in the observation room were oblivious to the young dragon's torture, staring at monitors filled with all sorts of biometric displays, personal history, and every scrap of information the US government could scrape together on a person. It was quite impressive, Chris thought. A bit disturbing too. 

"I'm not sure who's squirming more. You? Or him?" Lillian whispered. 

Tim just shook his head in mock disgust. Never in all his years of knowing her had Lillian behaved so... to call it unprofessional would be diplomatic. Then again, never had a vampire been pregnant. 

"I'll show you squirming," the dragon growled in frustration, making several of the technicians look up from their work. He waved his hand in apology before looking over at Tim almost pleadingly. It was like the vampire had had herself surgically attached to him since last night, refusing to be separated and constantly seeking affection. It might have been endearing if she wasn't teasing and somehow obstinate at the same time. 

"Yes," her invisible lips brushed his ear, her words thick with longing. "Make me squirm for you, please." 

This was just the problem, he could never get the upper hand. Respond to her teasing, she would call his bluff by raising the ante. Be firm and she would respond in kind with undead strength and the promise of fangs and claws. Do nothing? That was like an open invitation for her to do what she wanted. 

He sighed in defeat, deciding to ignore her even though he knew it wouldn't work. 

In front of him through the glass, Michelle asked the suspect another question. The man's name was Noel Redding and he was a pragmatist, he appeared to be cooperating fully. He was an ex-marine who had worked all over the shady end of private security after leaving the service. Michelle had laid it down in simple facts for the man. He had no rights. A judge would never see his case. She had the might of NSA to back her up as well as a vengeful dragon and an irate dark-elf. She already knew he and his team were guns for hire, they had well known history in that game. What she wanted was every detail to do with his employer and how he came to know about Beings. 

The picture that was being painted under Michelle's skilled questioning was not a good one. Their anonymous employer had initiated them into the world of magic, albeit rather poorly. This was the third such 'mission' his team had been hired to conduct. The first two had been successful. They'd captured a human wizard and a young werecat with the same routine they'd tried on Chris, delivering them to a transport team for a hefty sum of unmarked cash. They'd been contracted for three quarters of a million if they could bag Chris. 

He didn't know who was hiring them. It was all done anonymously but he was willing to provide all communication records and dates to do with their activities in exchange for he and his surviving partner, Chuck Abbot, being shown leniency. 

Michelle put a non-networked laptop in front of him and told him to start typing. As he did, she added that he'd better be honest. She was going to check his story by administering truth syrup in just a few hours once a fresh batch had been brewed. If there were any inconsistencies, she was going to let the vampire that his sniper had shot take over the questioning. 

The desired effect was momentarily ruined when Michelle had to explain what truth syrup was, but Chris watched the man's face rapidly pale as he realised he was truly in over his head. 

*** 

Chris shuffled from the kitchen back to the dining room table, plate in hand. With a tired sigh, he took a seat opposite Michelle. She was intently bent over her laptop screen, exactly how he'd left her ten minutes before. 

"Would you like half a sandwich?" He offered. 

"What?" Michelle looked up as if startled to see him. "Oh. No, thanks. You must be hungry after the day you've had. You're also suffering the effects of blood loss, eat up." 

The dragon only paused momentarily with the huge sandwich in limbo between his mouth and the plate. The beautiful, feisty vampire, currently exiled to a comfy recliner in the living room, was worth any mild discomfort. He would simply adapt and grow stronger. 

It had been a long afternoon downtown at the new BIA building. 

Of course, no one knew who had really purchased the entire red brick mid-rise but neighbouring shopkeepers and tenants noted the uncharacteristically quick and efficient construction going on inside behind closed doors. 

After watching Michelle deal with Noel Redding, he'd experienced his own haranguing by a couple of detectives from the Denver PD about the previous evening's activities. They knew his story of events wasn't adding up. He knew he couldn't tell them anything about magic or how he'd managed to really kill three armed attackers and disarm the rest. Adding to their frustration were several eye witness accounts of his heroics that were frustratingly lacking in any real detail. 

Michelle seemed to know one of them somehow, a Detective Field. He was reasonable. The other was like a vicious feist, latching onto him and not willing to let go. For some reason the guy hated that the media had taken to Chris as some sort of hero. Detective Field even bore a few of the terrier-like man's more cutting remarks for his apparent role in Chris' newfound spotlight. 

Chris supposed the detective's tenacity probably made him good at his job, except that this time he was barking up the wrong tree. He wasn't the bad guy and he didn't appreciate being painted that way by someone ignorant. 

Michelle, seeing Chris' growing frustration as the detective tried to corner him in a lie, left the room and put in a call to her new head of department. Ten minutes later, a call from the Chief of Police sent the two men packing, if grumbling. 

Back in the police administration building, the Chief was left reeling at what had just been exposed to him. That morning, his biggest worry had been for one of his undercover officers who was stuck in a dangerous situation whilst trying to infiltrate a methamphetamine ring. Now he was discovering he lived in a world of dragons and vampires. 

"Any luck?" Chris gestured as her clacking fingers brought his attention towards her laptop. 

"No. I don't like this at all," Michelle said, not pausing her typing. "I'm not sure we're going to catch them. In fact, I'm almost sure we won't unless whoever is behind this gets sloppy." 

In front of her, page after page of routing information scrolled across her screen. Tracking programs trying to chase down the elusive messages sent to Noel Redding's email address. 

"Why? I thought you guys trawl through emails all the time?" Chris spoke around his first big mouthful of smoked chicken, lettuce, tomato, and creamed cheese sandwich. 

"I'm afraid it's not as easy when the email gets routed through several countries we don't have any worthwhile electronic surveillance operations in. Our trail ends abruptly when it gets passed through Pakistan into Iran. Whoever's behind this knows what they're doing. More worrying is where they are getting their information. I suspect we have a leak on the human side of things, someone is trying to cash in early on the Revelation. The greedy bastards are going to ruin everything," the disgust in her tone was palpable. 

"So where does that leave us?" Chris frowned. The thought that someone out there was kidnapping Beings did not sit well at all, and not just because they'd tried to come at him. Despite that Michelle though otherwise, he was paranoid that Radek was somehow involved. His mind was over-imaginative about what the man would undoubtedly do to his captives. 

"Nowhere." The agent looked up noticing his displeasure, a tiny smile brightened her serious expression, pleased that he was getting invested in the case. "At this stage, about the only thing we are confident of is that whoever we're after is probably human. Everything I've seen so far points that way. A Being wouldn't bother kidnapping relative unknowns like Noel admitted to in his previous jobs. Also, they would never send only a few ill-equipped humans after someone like you, or any class one for that matter. Then there's the untraceable emails, not exactly Being SOP." 

"We still have one avenue open to us but it's time sensitive," Lillian finally spoke up from the couch-seat where Chris had banished her. Her constant hovering, petting, and so called 'love bites,' whilst initially endearing were not conducive to a hungry man eating a well-deserved lunch. All he wanted was to eat in peace for fifteen minutes. That she had to be wrestled into the recliner, kissed into submission, and bribed with more of his blood was beside the point. 

"What?" he asked hastily around half a mouthful, turning to Lillian. "I want to catch these bastards." 

"A baited hook," the vampire replied. 

"But that would make... Chris... No, I don't think so," Michelle scowled. 

"The bait," he swallowed and grinned, looking right into his familiar's worried eyes. "Do it. This is exactly what I signed up for." 

"That's not how it works, Chris. This could be very dangerous and I'm responsible for you if I put you in the field," she argued. 

"Come on, Michelle," he pestered. "If you aren't going to use me for something like this, what was the point in getting me signed on with the government. Did you waste the last two month's worth of my evenings on training modules for the fun of it?" 

"Okay. Okay, let me think." She raised her hands in surrender. He was right, and she was warming to the idea. The task was daunting though. "This is going to take a lot of planning. God damn it, Lillian, I hardly got any sleep last night and you spring this on me. It's never easy around here." 

"Do you want to catch them or not?" the vampire quipped. 

"Of course I do," Michelle shot back, her brows knitting together like tiny thunderheads at her frustration. "You're not the one who has to organise this nightmare on short notice though. Just put your feet up and let me work, I'm sure it's arduous work being pregnant over there." 

Lillian hissed playfully. 

Chris couldn't help chuckling at the banter between the two. 

"Can I help?" he offered Michelle. 

"No, not really, just keep Lillian out of my hair. Sorry, Chris, Monday is supposed to be your first day on the job but I'm afraid we'll be throwing you straight in the deep end. The team I was putting together around you for our Denver office were supposed to be arriving throughout the week but we could really use them for this. I'll have to have them fly in tomorrow and they won't be happy." 

Chris watched as Michelle pulled a headset out of her bag and began typing away furiously. She began muttering cutely under her breath. Sexy things like 'requisition order,' 'jet on standby,' 'satellite coverage,' and 'armoured extraction vehicle.' When she started making calls and talking, her fingers continued their dance like a troop of ballerina across the keys. 

When he got up and cleared his plate, she didn't even look up. He shrugged to Lillian. 

"Want to go see Reyla?" he asked. 

"Sure, I never got to gloat last night," Lillian smirked. 

"Please behave." Chris knew it was a hopeless endeavour but he had to try. 

*** 

As it turned out, their visit to Reyla's study was relatively peaceful. There wasn't a single spell cast, book thrown, or talon drawn. Plenty of raised voices, angry glares, flared nostrils, and poorly veiled insults though. 

Thankfully Arvil was there, researching the very thing they came to discuss. Chris went over to say hello as Reyla and Lillian circled each other like angry she-cats, hissing and yowling. 

Reyla's main jab seemed to be that Lillian's true colours were finally showing, that she was an ungrateful, treacherous slut. Meanwhile, Lillian maintained that Reyla was simply a sadistic old nag who wouldn't know what to do with a cock if it slapped her in the face but would hold it against anyone else who did. The core of the issue was, of course, the unresolved resentment from both sides over Lillian's years of indentured service and now her sudden freedom. The delicate balance of power had been shattered and both powerful women were unsure how to behave and wary of each other. Chris was just happy they weren't letting each other's blood, yet. 

Now that their bloodpact was broken, Reyla had no physical hold over the vampire other than her position as lady of the territory. In short, the elf found herself once again angry, jealous, and impotent as the dragon brought more strife to her little kingdom. If it wasn't clear that he was favoured by whatever force was weaving their fates, she might have been tempted to banish him to another territory simply to avoid the hassle. 

It was a frivolous thought of course, she would never let one such as him escape her influence. Truth be told, she liked the young dragon. He made her realise that her life had become stale. She was entrenched in her position and he was a sweet-smelling breeze that blew through and around her, promising excitement and adventure once again to her ancient soul. Besides, he was already doing wonders for her local economy and people. 

Reyla was also intelligent enough to know that she couldn't afford to lose Lillian in a time like this, she was holding the vampire community in the midwest together. That didn't even begin to consider the vampire's impossible pregnancy. The Synod hadn't believed her when she reported the event early that morning. Several members had outright laughed at her. She could hardly blame them but it galled her nonetheless. 

Lillian on the other hand realised that she had to keep things mostly civil between the two of them. She was tied to Chris now, which meant staying in Denver for the time being. Despite her resentment for years of vassalage to the elf, she had to live in her city. 

It was a cutting off her nose to spite her face situation. She had connections here and she felt like she was doing an excellent job helping other vampires and Beings prepare for the Revelation. If Relya treated her with a bit more respect than a servant, she already had what she'd wanted this whole time, her freedom. 

"Read this," Arvil passed Chris a medium sized tome bound with black leather while the two women settled into a tentative truce. "It's the best account of the vampire prophecy I can find in my cousin's collection." 

Despite not being very large, the book was very dense, heavy. Chris slouched into an empty armchair next to the half-breed elf and laid it on his thigh. As soon as he opened the cover, he noted the extremely thin, gold-gilded pages. The paper was so thin you could almost read the letters on the next page if the text hadn't been so tiny and hand written. 

Arvil leaned closer across the gap separating their chairs so he could read as well, conjuring another light globe above the dragon's head so they could see the script clearly. Chris gently began turning the delicate pages aimlessly, in awe of the craftsmanship and work that went into creating such a subtle artwork of bookmaking. 

"It begins on page nine-hundred and thirty-seven," the elf prompted, eager to see the young man's reaction. In the two months he'd been training the dragon, he'd come to appreciate the level headed, relaxed attitude Chris exuded. Arvil would like to think they were becoming friends. On top of that, there was always something exciting and mysterious going on around the enigmatic Being. This most recent upset only proved that. 

"Here?" Chris asked, pointing to a small paragraph as Reyla and Lillian negotiated the new terms of their tense working relationship in the background. 

"That's the one," Arvil confirmed. 

<em>Extract from the interrogation of Father Lucas de Vega. Accused of heresy, witchcraft, vampirism, and blasphemy. Twelfth day, fourth month in the year of Our Father, 1512.</em> 

<em>After three hours chained to the holy silver cross of our Lord, Calificador Mendoza lashed the beast two score with the cat. Having no doubt that the imposter was indeed a devil in the skin of an old priest, Mendoza did not hesitate to draw the foul creature's blood. The demon begged for mercy, offering promises and lies in exchange for freedom as such monstrosities are want to do. I confess weakness, for I looked away from the terrible sight when the beast's hide began to wither and crack unnaturally under the lash. The blessed silver poisoned the hideous beast, burning its skin black.</em> 

<em>Just as Mendoza had prayed, our Lord drained its Satan-spawned strength and false immortality. I saw then the creature's terrible fangs as it let out a piteous death shriek.</em> 

<em>The Calificador wrenched back the old man's pallid hair and demanded the location of the nest that spawned him, for it is know that such demons seek shelter from the sun together in heinous covens. There was no reply, for the man had expired. Mendoza was most dissatisfied, ordering me to cut it down and burn the corpse. I was afraid, fearing trickery, and put my boot in the creatures gut to assure myself of its demise.</em> 

<em>The head snapped upward unnaturally, looking at me with eyes of pure black. I admit my bladder failed me then, but brave Mendoza pulled me out of harm's way as the Beast himself spoke through his dead servant. My very bones quaked to hear that terrible voice of darkness, spoken from the depths of hell. Though I will surely try, I may never forget that horrible prophecy for the rest of my days.</em> 

<em>"The barren daughter of Lilith bears fruit with the serpent. Lo, the children of that blessed union are the sacrament of a new age. Their blood, the communion. My kind will walk in the sun again."</em> 

<em>The old priest's body went mercifully limp again and I gave thanks to the Lord for my salvation in the presence of such pure evil. I could smell the very fumes of brimstone thick in the air as Satan took his leave. It was only when I sat to catch my breath and thank God once again for my deliverance that I realised the terrible sulphurous odour had its origin in my own pantaloons.</em> 

<em>Alcaide Pedro de Torquemada</em> 

Chris looked up at the end of the passage. 

"You cannot be serious." Chris arched an incredulous eyebrow. 

"Why not? We know that Lucas de Vega was a vampire, that he was captured and tortured to death in the first half of 1512. There was also a corresponding peak of magic recorded at or near his assumed time of death. The imperial psykers investigated his death when it was found to relate to the spike. They came across this account of his death and added it to the Encyclopedia of Prophecy before erasing the memories of his torturers," Arvil explained. 

"Wait, who the hell is keeping record of all these magical goings on?" 

"The elves. We have always coveted knowledge and the Imperial Court has ever been interested in any powerful surge of magic. House Lefayd in particular takes interest in such things, they are ever greedy for knowledge. Your recent activities will not have escaped their attention, of course." 

"Of course," Chris rolled his eyes. "Come on, Arvil, the man in the story shat himself. Next, you're going to tell me I should take the bible literally, word for word." 

"Ha! Yes, well, I'm surprised at the poor lad's honesty, but it shouldn't subtract from meat of the account. You're right of course. Scepticism is always healthy but let me play devil's advocate for a moment. How many pregnant vampires do you know of?" Arvil grinned, knowing he had the argument cinched. 

"One," the dragon admitted. 

"Precisely, and a dragon might also be referred to as a..." 

"Alright, you've made your point. A serpent. Jees, why can't a guy just bury his head in the sand and have his problems go away for once," Chris complained. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 13|
--------------------------------------------
"Where's the fun in that?" Arvil took back the old book and glanced at the passage for what must be the seventh or eighth time that day. "We haven't even gotten to the good part yet. The real kicker is; 'Lo the children of that blessed union are the sacrament of a new age. Their blood, the communion. My kind will walk in the sun again.' What do you make of that?" 

"I have no fucking idea," Chris grumbled. 

"That's not entirely true," Lillian chimed in. "Weren't you planning to tell Reyla about what we discussed last night? Shouldn't Arvil know as well?" 

"Know what?" both elves parroted. 

Reyla scowled. 

"That he's got something other than dragon lurking in his blood." 

*** 

As he and Lillian made their way back to the apartment, Chris couldn't help but despair at how busy his week was shaping up to be. Now add to that list a visit by members of the vampire council to assess Lillian. He looped his arm through hers and let her guide him through the Compound's maze of corridors as he fired up his Maginet-connected phone. 

There were a swarm of alerts he'd been collecting all day, studiously ignoring. He had emails, voice messages, texts, just about any way you could think of getting hold of him, people were trying. They were all to do with last night's shooting. Strangers, old friends, people he hadn't even talked to in years all wanted to know his story. He honestly wouldn't be that surprised if a trained pigeon flew by and dropped a note on his head. 

He swiped them all away, bar one. It was a text message from Jethry, asking if he was okay and were the girls shaken up. He smiled, feeling guilty about leaving the old werecat all alone on the little ranch. There was no reason for it, he could visit at the drop of a hat if he put in the effort to teleport out there and back. He'd just been so damn busy. 

With a little jolt of horror, it dawned upon him that the reality of this notoriety was only ever going to get worse. Shaking his head in disgust, he resolved that Jethry would have to be paid a visit sometime this week. 

Instead of calling, he typed out a little text assuring the werecat that he was fine and that he'd even managed to bag the hot vampire in the process. He showed Lillian before sending it off. She laughed and pointed out how jealous the horny old coot was going to be when Chris regaled him with stories about the wonders of her curves. 

Annabel was just finishing her ingredient preparation in the kitchen when they got back. It looked like they were going to be having homemade pizza as his wonderful fiancé kneaded a big ball of dough into submission. From behind, he slipped his hands inside her apron, tickling her belly and proceeded to kiss and snuffle sloppily across her neck and ears. She squealed in protest, jumping up and down but was helpless to do anything with her sticky, flour-covered hands. 

His torture was progressing well until she realised the power of her doughy hands as a deterrent. Then it was his turn to yelp in shock as she smeared one across his face and chased him out of the kitchen with harsh whip-like cracks of a dishtowel. 

Michelle tried to get his attention as he passed but he asked her to give him a few minutes to go say hello to everyone and clean up before they got down to work again. A few minutes in the bathroom, a quick peck and a hug for Susan as she sat reading in an armchair, then he was off to the brave the dangers of the second apartment. Michelle sighed, knowing that once the dragonesses got their claws on him, she wouldn't see him for at least half an hour. 

Lillian closed the blinds against the evening sun, decloaked, and got a bottle of chilled sauvignon blanc out of the fridge. She collected a few glasses and went to keep Michelle company as she fired off email after email on her tablet. It turned out that the wine was very tasty indeed, imported from New Zealand of all places. As they talked shop, they consumed nearly three quarters of the bottle before Chris got back. 

His hair was decidedly rumpled. Combined with his stupid 'I just had awesome sex' grin and the heavy musk of coitus which clung to the air around him, there was no doubt what he'd been doing. The only real question was who was the lucky lady or did he have a quickie with each of the striking dragonesses. 

Michelle, Annabel, and Lillian all looked at each other, then back at Chris as he strutted back over to the kitchen like some sort of conquering peacock. 

"Shower!" they all cried in unison. 

It was comical to watch his swagger fade to bashfulness before he beat a hasty retreat to his bedroom to clean up before dinner. They shared a laugh at his self-conscious departure. 

It didn't take a detective to notice Lillian squirming in her seat and glancing over towards his bedroom. Michelle let her stew for about thirty seconds before taking mercy. 

"You know, Lillian, if you've got someone... Oops, I mean...something you'd rather be doing..." The vampire didn't even bother waiting to hear the end of her joke. Michelle laughed again as Lillian chased after him. "It's a wonder anything gets done around here." 

"Well Lillian's about to get done, so that's something!" Annabel chimed from the kitchen. 

The NSA agent had to admit that it probably was, though the thought was troubling. What on earth could impregnate a vampire? The news of Chris' uncertain heritage had been weighing heavily on her all day. She'd been relying on Reyla to pick up the ball on that one, and it was disturbing to hear from Lillian that the ancient elf had drawn a blank. 

*** 

Chris' cock was still throbbing and sensitive when he stepped in to the warm water of the big shower. It felt almost unbearably hot on his crown, which had just seen some vigorous action inside both Claire and Petra. He began cleaning himself up, taking extra care to lather his cock and rinse under his foreskin. 

The bathroom was still a mess, a big, ass-shaped hole sunken into the wall and pieces of the white, crumbly material strewn across the tiled floor. Who exactly was going to fix that was a mystery. As he grabbed the soap and began lathering up, he supposed he should make a call to the front desk and fess up to the situation. That would be the responsible thing. 

Distracted with running through scenarios of how that call might play out, he didn't notice he had company until the glass door of the shower stall pushed open, letting in a rush of cooler air. 

He spun to behold Lillian's naked perfection as she glided in with him. 

"Holy shit," he whispered, eyes drawn like magnets to the shape of her huge, upturned breasts. Her stiff, light brown nipples and pebbled areola bobbed hypnotically as she closed the distance between them. The wicked grin on her sensual lips removed doubt about her purpose. 

For an unending moment, his mind was struck dumb with her voluptuous beauty. Her bust and hips were lush beyond belief, but her waist was perfectly tapered. Her skin was so pale you could easily witness the red flush of heat and the blue lattice of veins underneath. It wasn't just her physical beauty that captivated him though. She was so confident in her desirability, her sexuality. It made him shiver in anticipation as she sashayed closer, her eyes like those of a lustful jungle predator. Her seductive smile said she knew exactly what she was doing. How was such a carnal creature even possible? 

"Mmmhh, yes. I'll take your lack of eloquence as a compliment." She stopped just short of touching him. He could swear her nipple was about a centimetre away from his skin as the water began pelting down over her flawless, pale body. He was jolted out of his titty-trance as both of her hands collected his swelling, sudsy cock without preamble. "I've been squirming all day just thinking about last night. Jesus, I can't believe I'm pregnant. None of this seems real, but it's winding me up so tight inside. I need a fuck. You'd better have something left in here for me, stud." 

She squeezed his big, heavy testes for emphasis before beginning an expert, twisting, double-handed jerk on his throbbing shaft. 

"Oh, fuck." His hands automatically came to rest on the taper of her waist. His knees almost buckled under the deluge of pleasure her hands unleashed. Her excited nipples brushed back and forth teasingly against his skin. It was overwhelming. He collapsed into her, letting her take his weight, their bodies hot and slippery under the pattering shower. She smiled her predatory grin. His head rested on her shoulder as his big body began shuddering, completely in her control. 

"Mmm?" she crooned, working his cock up to full mast with no trouble at all. "Who did you just fuck, Chris? Petra? Claire?" 

"Ahhhaa," he moaned incoherently as his sex-sore cock twitched and jumped, runny precum splattering into her wet tummy before being carried away in the torrent of warm water. 

"Both?" she demanded with a harsh squeeze to his fearsome weapon. Damn, there was no way she could get her hand around his thickness, especially not his huge knob. "I'm jealous even thinking about it. This is my cock. Mine! I got so wet knowing you were next door fucking them, it was torture. I'm sure there's a puddle in my chair, Chris. A dirty, slimy, puddle for anyone to sit in." 

"Lillian... please," he panted, held completely at her mercy as her words and hands sent him barrelling toward a premature explosion. 

"I need you to fuck me, Chris. Fuck some sense into me before my vampire gets the upper hand," her breath in his ear was hot and husky with need as her hands kept working. With the water washing away the soap, she was now pulling his delicate cock-skin back and forth over the granite-hard pillar of manhood underneath. It was almost uncomfortable but incredibly good at the same time. "I hope you know, I'm going to need this monster in me each and every day. They say pregnant women get extra randy, well now you've got a pregnant vampire to deal with. I'm going to need a really good seeing to, starting right god damn now!" 

He groaned as her hands fell away without warning, leaving him throbbing and teased. His head rose as she turned in his arms and chose a place against the shower wall. Her back arched beautifully but instead of pushing against the wall with her arms as Annabel often did, she lay her whole front into the tiles. Her head was turned sideways, wet brown locks snaking down to her shoulder blades as she looked back at him. 

"Get over here!" she demanded. 

As he shuffled up behind her, it was refreshing to note that her height was going to make this a lot easier than his usual partners. 

"Jesus, Lillian, your ass is something else," he grunted appreciatively as his angry red glans butted into the deep cleft between the huge globes of soft, feminine perfection. 

"It's not too big, too fat?" the vampire smirked teasingly. 

"Fuck no!" He would never dream of disparaging the ample perfection of her sizable derriere. 

"Good, it's all yours now, if you want it," Her hands reached back and each took a grip on a full buttock. With teasing slowness, she watched him over her shoulder and pulled them apart. She knew her tight, winking rosebud and glistening pussy were gloriously framed in centre stage. Her grin widened, and her fangs extended in anticipation as his eyes were glued to the uncouth display. His enthusiastic cock even had the audacity to eject a little ribbon of excitement out onto her little butt hole, starting a maddening tingling-warmth. She stretched up on to her tiptoes, calves straining, and pushed herself into the wall expectantly. "Well? Take your pick." 

"My... my pick?" he stammered. Surely she didn't mean...that? 

"That's right, Chris, you can fuck me however you want. That's the deal, remember?" She couldn't help herself. Despite being an accomplished, incredibly gifted lover, the young man was obviously still a little inexperienced. How wonderful that she would be the one to introduce him to such hedonistic delights. 

"I don't think... I..." 

"Sshhh. It's okay, young one. Later then," she encouraged, watching his big body relax as she let him off the hook. His innocence screamed at her to pounce on him and fuck him silly but what she really wanted was for him to take charge. "Don't keep me waiting." 

Chris took a grip on his throbbing member and levered it down to her puffy slit. Her lips resisted his initial prodding but were soon spread wide as his fat tip slipped into her almost scalding heat. 

Together they groaned in satisfaction as they were once again mated. For a few breaths, Lillian savoured the hot, stretching feeling of her engorged labia struggling with his knob. Without warning, she thrust her hips back savagely, spearing herself on his manhood with a joyous cry. He was hot and hard and perfect, spreading her pink tissues open in an incredibly satisfying lunge. This was the very same specimen that had somehow planted life in her previously desolate womb. A mother... she was being forced into impossible motherhood by this perfect, kind-hearted, innocent, delicious, godly-powerful dragon-boy. Her entire body shuddered at the incredible thought, her legs going weak as an orgasm rose up out of nowhere and overwhelmed her. 

"Aahhhh! Fuckkkkk! Just like that!" she squeezed her eyes shut in pleasured astonishment as he roughly grabbed her hips and began hunching into her tight, quivering womanhood. It was like he knew exactly what she needed. At the same time, her pussy felt like it was being crucified by his beefy prick. "Slow down! No, don't you dare stop! Jesus. Just slow, slow and steady!" 

"Sorry," he panted against her shoulder. 

Chris tried to slow, he honestly did, but she was meeting his every move with a buck of her wide hips. Her molten, over-ripe quim was just too good to restrain himself and he sank delightfully deeper with every thrust. Her hands still held her cheeks apart and he could watch every inch of progress he made into her pink depths. It was an incredibly arousing image to see her labia straining out over his retreating cock like a fleshy tube, leaving behind a glistening, slick mark to show exactly how much of his dick he'd had inside her. She had plenty of oil in her engine, their sex making nasty, juicy sounds as lubricated friction brought pleasure to them both. The heat of the forgotten shower fell uselessly to the floor behind them as they set about the rigorous process of rutting to their heart's content. 

His hips met her ample rump with a wet slap, causing a visually stunning tsunami of ripples to propagate up her full-figured body. She moaned, probably loud enough to be heard on the floor below. He hunched forward further, smooshing her big ass with his hips to get the last few inches into her clutching heat. Finally, he grunted in animal satisfaction as she took every last inch of his rock-hard shaft. 

She let go of her butt and grabbed his hips, holding him deep inside for a moment as they both panted for air. His tip was just nudging her cervix. She was exquisitely full, her cunny squeezing the big invader for all it was worth. Until now, she hadn't realised how tense her entire body was, almost fighting his rough penetration. She consciously relaxed, sending a shiver running up her spine. This was glorious. With a patented wide grin over her shoulder, she began flexing and relaxing her internal muscles. 

"Hold still," she murmured, "You're going to love this trick." 

Working a little rotation into her hips made him groan into her neck, all the while milking him with her experienced vagina. Finally, she began the practiced, circular rhythm that had earned her the regard of many a fine young nobleman centuries ago. 

She squeezed him hard, pulling away and twisting her hips to the right and down so about half of him slipped reluctantly from her clinging sheath. Already moaning wordlessly, she relaxed and began completing the loop to have him back inside. Her hips cocked to the left and up, pushing back against him now with a shove from her powerful legs. Finally, her back arched, she had all of him once again, stretching her to the limit. Eyelids fluttering, toned calves trembling, she did it again. Again. Again, and faster again. 

It was a mimic of how she'd ridden him with abandon last night, her whole body working to get him off without a single thrust on his part. She grunted sexily, huffing as she stirred herself into a pleasured frenzy. This was supposed get him off nice and quick, show off her sexual prowess. As full as she was of his hardness, she knew it was going to be a battle to see who succumbed to pleasure first. She loved a large cock and he was easily the biggest she'd ever tackled. 

"Ohhhhh, that's fucking perfect!" he groaned, it felt like she was repeatedly corkscrewing her incredible pussy down on him. 

Her hips were a wonder of bumping, clockwise rotation, her vagina a never-ending maelstrom of tugs, glides, and squeezes. She was so damn soft and warm, tight and inviting. His erection was being absolutely spoiled by her talented womanhood. It was so sexy to see her moaning and glaring lusty daggers over her pale shoulder at him even as her fangs worried her plush lower lip. 

The tell tail gathering of tension in his groin signalled his final headlong charge for release as she continued to work him over. So much pleasure in his bulbous, sensitive tip as it rubbed against her spongy tissues without even a single movement on his part. It was maddening as his abdomen began to shiver, his cock thicken. He had to contribute. 

With an animalistic rumble, Chris snaked a hand up and around her body, prising her off the cool tiles to firmly cup a large breast. Her bountiful tit completely defied his attempt at containment, the pale, soft flesh bulging around his fingers as he squeezed greedily. Grip secured, his hips reared back, eliciting a breathy gasp from the sexy vampire as his great cock retreated a few inches, rubbing her sensitive, greasy folds as it went. The sharp pleasure built rapidly in the base of his cock as he began pounding home with short, hard lunges. She shrieked in delight, still gyrating, her strained labia nipping at his thick root as he once again took control of her pleasure. 

His free hand slipped low onto her smooth mons, spreading around their coupling to gather some of the copious fluids they were leaking. Slickened, he focused on the firm little nubbin exposed at the top of her slit. Lillian moaned in abject bliss, her body stiffening, thighs shuddering, back arching. 

"Yes! Oh, Chris. Yes, yes, yes, yes!" she trailed off into an ear-piercing squeal, finally succumbing. 

Chris crushed his body into her plush frame with a responding growl of triumph. Feeling her come apart, he finally released the last shred of control he'd been clinging to. Hunching little thrusts drove him over the precipice, the wonderful tension of climax shattering into a thousand shivers of pure satisfaction. 

His enormous cock bucked violently, a viscous rope of semen racing up the bulging length of his throbbing shaft to spray forth deep into her clinging, convulsing cunt. Another profuse jet followed to help paint her sensitive pink tissues white with sperm-laden dragon cum. He crowded her into the wall, ass flexing with every spout of his seed. Legs weakening, his instinct urged him to get as deep as possible as he positively hosed her scalding depths with an inhuman load of magic-infused man-batter. 

"Ahhh... aaaahhh... nnnggaahh," she cried out as he erupted endlessly. Each potent volley acknowledged with a cute little grunt from the blissful vampire as she felt it splash hot against her cervix. Her climax boiled up to an intolerable frenzy, forcing her eyes closed and an endearing scowl onto her brow as he strummed her clitoris without mercy. Her flushed cheek and the side of her face were still pressed against the cool tile, her inner beast sated, already gnawing at the pool of magic he was dumping in her loins. Eventually, she had to roughly pull his hand from her beleaguered little bean when it all became too sensitive. Instead, she guided him to cradle the spark of life already growing in her womb.

--------------------------------------------
There was something instinctually satisfying to the dragon in knowing that he had already helped create new life within his beloved mentor and friend. The cocky lizard couldn't help his ego swelling, who else could boast such a feat of virility? 

Lillian herself was surprised to feel that her usually selfish and uncaring vampiric side was coming around to the idea of pregnancy, possessing fierce maternal instincts never before awoken in one of her kind. 

Soon enough, her orgasm mellowed to a gentle simmer as he emptied the last of an unbelievable quantity of sperm in her heated depths. Her body struggled to contain the vast energy he pumped into her. Like his other partners before her, she could only try to relax and be the perfect receptacle for his gift. 

He sighed in incredible relief, panting and nibbling her neck ever so affectionately. She shuddered against him too, breath ragged. 

He gave an experimental, cheeky squeeze of the big nipple trapped between his fingers, stirring a little tut from her lips. Unable to resist, his hand left her tummy to cup and fondle its perfect twin, marvelling at the soft, heavy perfection in his clutches. 

"That was delicious," the vampire cooed her satisfaction, indulging his boyish pawing of her breasts. "I feel so much better. You fucked the jealousy right out of me." 

"It was fucking incredible is what it was," he paused, still catching his breath after such a powerful climax. "Where the hell did you learn to do that...your hips... that thing you did?" 

"Oh, you liked that, huh?" she teased even as his gluey semen reluctantly leaking down her thick, quivering thighs. 

"Of course I liked it! I don't even..." he paused leaning forward to kiss her instead of babbling on. At the same time, he continued to massage her magnificent breasts with all the enthusiasm appropriate for a horny young man his age. 

She smiled into his kiss, enjoying his youthful if inexperienced ministrations. He wasn't even going soft inside her. Their tongues met hotly for a few moments but the angle wasn't right. She began wriggling her rump back and forth, eliciting a strangled groan from her young lover. Her hips rocked from side to side in ever increasing arcs, putting some delicious strain on his stiff, blood filled cock as well as the tender folds of her leaking pussy. Eventually, she went so far that he popped out with a lewd little squelch. 

She turned and giggled at his adorable look of worship, leaning up to kiss him for real, arms snaking around his neck. 

"I learned most of my little tricks long, long ago." 

"You mean back when you were..." 

"A whore? Yes, Chris, you can say it you know? It's only a word, I'm a big girl," she couldn't help squishing her breasts into his masculine chest to tease him. 

"Okay, it just feels weird. I don't want to be disrespectful." His powerful arms wrapped around her in turn, caressing her flanks and back with roaming fingers. 

"You aren't. It's all about context. I knew what I was doing back then and I loved it. I tried to be the best I could be, and I was. I learned to enjoy both giving and receiving pleasure in almost every form. I was so exceptional, I caught the eye of a visiting cardinal. He turned out to be a vampire. The rest, as they say, is history. Now after five hundred years, you get to enjoy it all for yourself. The twenty-eight-year-old body of Moscow's most sought-after mistress, frozen in time just for you, Chris." 

"Wow, no pressure, huh?" He was only half joking. That was some seriously intimidating experience. 

"Believe me, Chris, you've got nothing to worry about. You were right, there is something between us, not just your delicious blood. You ring the ever-loving shit out of my bell and you've somehow managed to put a pea in my pod. Whatever that means, I'm with you. Wonderful sex is only making it better and better." 

"Thanks, Lillian." 

His cocky little smile returned as they stepped back into the warm spray and began washing themselves clean of sweat and sex. She couldn't let that go unanswered, the boy's head would surely explode if he wasn't kept in check. 

"And Chris?" 

"Yeah?" 

"I'm serious about my offer. Whenever you want, we can try it in my ass. Okay?" 

That seemed to put him right back in his place, wide eyed and speechless. 

"What, you're scared of my little chocolate spider?" Lillian smirked impishly at the stunned young man before leaning in to place a series of feather light kisses along his jaw, up towards his ear. 

"Chocolate spi... Oh god, Lillian. I suppose it does sort of look like that," he guffawed at her description. "Really? We could try, I mean I've never..." 

"I know. That much is obvious," she laughed kindly, her eyes twinkling mischievously. "But that's for later. Now you've had your fun with me, it's time to collect," she whispered as she leaned in to nibble his neck. Her fangs extended, arms tightening around him as she prepared to feed. His body was quivering as the sharp tips of her canines scratched dangerously down the tender flesh of his throat to hover right over the thrumming flow of his jugular vein. She could feel his rich blood as her pink tongue bathed the area with mild aesthetic, drawing out their mutual anticipation. 

His scent was warm and powerful, only hinting at a trace of fear as he willingly gave her access to such a vulnerable area. The feeling of power was intoxicating for the vampire. His grip around her only tightened in acceptance and welcome, his breath hitching as she pierced him. Then she was lapping greedily, addictive blood welling up rapidly from the two little puncture wounds. 

He relaxed as a tiny bit of her venom began circulating through his capillaries. Lillian couldn't help squeezing him to her with undead strength, latching onto him like a hungry leech as her instincts took over. He splashed hot across her tongue, just as delicious as she remembered. A moan of complete satisfaction welled up inside her. The parasite in her reanimated cells writhed in ecstasy, consumed by his divine sustenance. She sucked greedily at his besieged vein, swallowing repeatedly as his warmth and power spread through her already magic-loaded body. 

"Lillian," came his quiet croak of protest. A dull ache began throbbing in the back of his head as she applied suction to increase the flow, his brain was protesting the loss of blood pressure, his cock was softening at an unusually fast rate. He couldn't help wondering if she was going to let him go or just slurp him dry like one of her blood boxes. He shuddered at the very real possibility. 

Thankfully, she heard him and let up on the suction. Instead, she began lapping repeatedly across the little sores. The flow slowed to a trickle, then stopped entirely as his own restorative powers and the enzymes in her saliva worked together to close the wounds entirely. Out in the world, it was important that vampires left no trace. 

With a parting kiss to his tender flesh and a lick of her plump lips, the vampire leaned back to study this Being that held such a grip on her existence simply by the potency of his lifeblood. The dragon smiled down at her, a little lightheaded and goofy looking. Adorable. 

When she leaned in and their lips touched, it was with a passion and hot intensity that bordered on worship. Her inner beast cooed and simpered, completely devoted to the creature that gifted her such friendship, rich sustenance, delightful sex, and even the impossibility of motherhood. 

"God damn you, Chris Baryst," she rested her forehead against his as their lips finally parted, "you're making me fall in love." 

Chris hugged her tighter, his bleary mind was trying to come up with some sort of eloquent reply but a quiet pop and a high-pitched shriek of outrage interrupted their tender embrace. 

"I knew it, you're wasting it! You're wasting it!" Immi reached up and hammered on their thighs with small fists as water drizzled down on them all. "You're a greedy, nasty, selfish pointy-mouth. I knew it!" 

Chris rolled his eyes apologetically to Lillian, who was so stunned at the sudden emergence of the sprite that she hadn't had time to even consider becoming cross at the rude intrusion on such a private moment. 

"I'm sorry, Lillian, I'm afraid I've been spoiling our little princess and she's become rather entitled," He leaned over and unceremoniously manhandled the tiny squirming woman into the crook of his arm, lifting her up to a more manageable height and focusing his attention on her. By now, he could almost ignore the charms of her constant nakedness. "Immi, this is exactly what we've talked about. This is bad behaviour." 

Lillian watched on in fascination as the now glistening blue sprite scowled in frustration. 

"But Master, she's wasting it," Immi complained. "It's just dripping out of her big slutty hole and washing down the drain. All that wonderful seed wasted. It's not fair!" 

Lillian snorted, finally realising what the little strumpet was making such a fuss about. Her hand snaked down to her 'big slutty hole,' she had to admit the sprite had a way with words. With a probing finger, she found herself swampy and decidedly cream-filled. Chris' sticky cum was washing off her thighs but had by no means drained out of her yet. She was going to need the help of the detachable showerhead for that. 

"Apologise," Chris spoke sternly. "What Lillian and I do together is our business. If you're going to insult her and barge in on us like a little brat there will be punishment. No more of your favourite for two weeks, how does that sound?" 

"Noooo! Please! Master, Lillian, I'm sorry, okay?!" Immi's hands came together in supplication. "I was just keeping watch in the Ether after everything that happened yesterday and I felt the energy when you... when you came, Master. I couldn't help running to see what was happening, I thought you and Annabel might be, you know, and maybe I could join in. Then I saw all that tasty energy being wasted, washing down into the sewers! I just got so mad... The sewers!" 

"Is this what all the fuss is about?" Lillian brought her hand into view, revealing two fingers glistening with his thick, pearlescent seed, scooped directly from the puffy folds of her sex. 

Immi whimpered, starting forward at the indecent sight of the tasty morsel but Chris held her back. 

"Do you have to tease her, Lillian?" Chris sighed. "It's okay, Immi. You really need to work on your self-control and boundaries. People don't like to be interrupted in the middle of intimate moments." 

"Who says I'm teasing?" The vampire smiled. "Don't you want this, you pint-sized little pest?" 

"Please," Immi squirmed in his arms as Lillian stepped to the side of the shower stream and made a show of sniffing the clingy sex residue on her fingers. 

"Well then, here you go," Lillian held her fingers just out of the sprite's reach, forcing her to lean forward, almost toppling out of Chris' grasp. At the very last second, with Immi's eyes hopeful and arms outstretched, Lillian whipped her hand away and quickly slipped the fingers into her own mouth. 

Immi wailed, hissing and spitting like an angry wildcat. Chris suddenly had a handful of vengeful sprite to contain as Lillian's melodic laughter bounced harshly around the shower cubicle. 

"Calm down, Immi!" Chris ordered as her not-so-small-anymore bat-like wings battered his face. In the end he had to give her little rump a harsh spank to gain her attention. 

"Ouch! Master, you saw it, you saw what she did! She's a meanie, a big, fat, pointy-mouth meanie," Immi protested, reaching back to rub her smarting backside. 

"Yes, I have to agree with you on that," Chris laughed in turn at the sprite's comical reaction. "Unfortunately, there's not much we can do about that." 

"Couldn't you hold her down for me, so I can get at her? Like you sometimes do with Mistress?" Immi asked hopefully. 

Lillian's eyebrow arched, and she gave one final slurp of her cum-covered fingers before releasing them. Her smile was Cheshire as Chris blushed under her scrutiny. 

"Immi, that's private," Chris' embarrassment was obvious. "No, we can't do that, Lillian is much too strong." 

"I don't know," the voluptuous vampire teased, her magnificent breasts jiggling with barely controlled laughter. "This is starting to sound interesting. What else does he do to Annabel for you, little one?" 

Chris groaned in exasperation as he flushed beet red, wishing that he had the confidence to not be embarrassed by her teasing. It was no use. 

"Humph, I'm not telling you." Immi crossed her arms and turned her head away. 

"How about a deal then?" Lillian returned her fingers to her enflamed labia and quickly scooped another healthy dollop of dragon-cum out of her greasy snatch. "One little scoop of this tasty treat for all the details of the nasty things he's been doing to you and Annabel while I've been away these last few weeks. He must have been doing something because you've grown a hell of a lot." 

"Five scoops," Immi's attention was instantly back on the vampire. 

"Don't do it, Immi," Chris cautioned. 

"Three," came Lillian's counter offer. 

"Five," the mischievous sprite shot a half apologetic look over her shoulder at Chris as if to say, 'what can you do?' 

"A real hard ass, huh? Okay then," Lillian giggled. "But you're going to tell me what you and Annabel have been doing to each other too. Sometimes I get back to the apartment and you two reek of each other." 

"Deal. But I get my treat first, I don't trust you, fang-face." Immi eyed the vampire's spunk-soaked digits, hungry but wary of more treachery. 

Chris shook his head as Lillian shrugged and held out her fingers again. This time the sprite, left nothing to chance, pouncing forward like a jack-in-the-box. 

"So, Chris, anything you want to fess up to before I find out all your little bedroom secrets?" Lillian's eyes twinkled as Immi quickly began polishing away any trace of his essence with obvious glee. "I wonder what Michelle is going to think about what you've been getting up to? Then again, Oslo will get a kick out of just about anything." 

"Aww, fuck this," Chris despaired. "I'm disappointed, Immi." 

"Sorry Master, mmrrrfff, yummy!" The sprite was clearly not in the least bit concerned now that she had such a tasty prize in her grasp. 

"I'm not sticking around to be teased anymore." With that, he unceremoniously dumped the sprite onto Lillian's ample bosom, eliciting a startled squeak. 

Upended, Immi had to scramble and clutch at anything she could get her hands on to avoid falling to the floor. She ended up gripping long strands of the vampire's tawny wet hair like a rope, trapped in the deep crevasse between two lofty mountains of tit-flesh like some climber holding on for dear life. Immi's feet dangled down near Lillian's mons, unable to find purchase on her wet skin. She was at the much larger woman's mercy. The sight almost gave him pause to stay as Lillian took pity and propped her arm under the blue sprite's shapely little bottom for a perch. They did make quite a striking pair. 

He got out of the shower before his resolve could falter, grabbing a fresh towel and dripping his way back into the big master bedroom he called his own. Behind him, over the sounds of splashing water he could hear Lillian prodding to give up the details while Immianthe's high pitched voice protested that she was to be paid in full before a single secret passed her lips. 

His ears were already burning at the thought of what Lillian might do with that sordid information. The dragon rumbled solidarity inside his chest, understanding the human's embarrassment but thinking it was silly nonetheless. 

Chris dried off hastily and got dressed in some loose blue track pants and a comfortable old t-shirt. The delicious odour of fresh-baked pizza crust and basil were starting to waft in under the bedroom door. His stomach growled approval and he chuckled to himself, shaking his head at how his life was evolving. 

If six months ago, he'd been able to glance into the future to this moment, he would have thought he'd lost the plot. His cock was throbbing angrily, still not completely flaccid, after the workout it had just received from three of the most sensuous women he could imagine. Yet despite his raging hunger and sexual exhaustion, his body felt full of vigour, magic coursed through his veins. Admittedly, he was still a little lightheaded when he stood up after putting his pants on. Lillian's toll was heavy, but he knew it wasn't anything he couldn't fix with a good hearty meal and a little rest. 

He rubbed his healed neck absentmindedly as he followed his nose back out into the communal area. He was greeted with knowing looks from his assemble brood. Even Michelle couldn't keep a little smirk off her face, her lips quivering for a moment before slightly turning up at the corners. Annabel was just pulling the first of the pizzas out of the oven; there were several more lined up on the bench ready for their turn to bake. It smelled amazing. 

He went to pester Annabel for an early taste but she shooed him off, telling him that if she let him tackle the molten cheese right now he would be whining tomorrow about his burnt pallet. She put the pizza in the safety of the warming drawer. Chris, admitting she was probably right, finally went over to get the update from Michelle that he'd been waylaid from receiving. 

She was hunched over her tablet, reading text that was far too small to be healthy. It looked like some sort of official document. The wine bottle on the table beside her computer was very nearly empty, so was her glass. He thought she looked quite haggard and stressed, and it struck him how hard she had been working for months now. 

"Michelle, give it a rest," he spoke softly, coming to a stop behind her seat at the dining room table and placing his hands on her stiff shoulders. 

She startled, skittish and unsure about being touched. However, an involuntary groan soon left her throat as his big hands began a gentle massage of her tense muscles. 

"Oh, God, that's incredible, Chris," a shudder of pleasure ran up her spine, making her sit up straight as he worked through a knot of stress just below the base of her neck. It was divine to feel his strong, warm grip and skilful fingers washing away the strain of her tired body. It had been so long since someone touched her intimately. 

"You've been working too hard, when was the last time you had a few days off?" He inched his thumbs down either side of her spine, pressing firmly through the thin cotton of her blouse. 

"I can't," she gasped, neck relaxing and rolling back as she leaned forward to give him better access. "Right there, yes! Oh my God, don't stop." 

Across the table, Claire smiled happily at Michelle's obvious pleasure and turned to her mother. 

"Remember the time I walked in on Chris giving you a nice backrub?" she asked Petra. 

"Yes, dear. It was just lovely," Petra remembered it clearly. A few weeks ago, they'd been caught by her sleepy daughter early one morning as she and Chris tried to sneak in a quickie before Claire woke up. It was no surprise that they'd been caught, give the amount of noise she'd been making. 

"Only I bet it wasn't just the massage that was lovely. I seem to remember he was rubbing a very tender spot a bit further down and much deeper at the same time!" she cackled at her mother's look of disapproval. 

"Don't pay any attention to those two, Michelle," Chris soothed. "They're just as bad as Lillian these days. Tell me what you've been working on this afternoon." 

Claire and Petra looked at each other, smiling at the obvious affection their mate had for his familiar. They were both wondering what was keeping those two apart. Such distance seemed silly to their dragon minds.

--------------------------------------------
Michelle's tired eyes closed, allowing her to fully enjoy his fingers as they rose to press and knead her neck. She took Chris' advice and ignored the two dirty dragonesses as his skilfully applied pressure seemed to drain her troubles away. 

"Well, for starters, I had to bully the police department into putting out a false statement that Noel Redding and his accomplice escaped police custody this afternoon while in transit to a high security prison." 

"I bet they didn't like that," Chris chuckled. 

"No, but I came down on them pretty hard about the need to catch who was responsible for hiring them. It helps that the Chief of Police knows about all of this now," she gestured expansively into the air as the massage continued. "I waited a few hours and then used Noel's email account to send his employer an angry message demanding payment for being misled about you and getting three of his team killed." 

"Do people really fall for that sort of trick?" he asked. 

"Surprisingly, yes. Meanwhile, I've been trying to gather the team I was putting together to work with you at the Denver office. I want to get them here asap, but I've only had mild success. Two are already busy trying to pack up their lives and move here later in the week, they have commitments over the next few days that can't be missed. The other two were already here in Denver but not scheduled to officially start until next week. They were happy enough to help, I think they're excited to unveil the mystery around their new jobs. We're still going to need Lillian's help if we have to move on this quickly though." 

"I don't think you have to worry, it would be hard to stop Lillian from getting further involved at this stage. You've mentioned this team a few times now but you haven't told me much. I'd like to know who I'll be working with. Who are they, what sort of backgrounds are they from?" 

He was a little apprehensive about officially starting his role with Michelle at the BIA tomorrow. It might seem crazy coming from an ether dragon, but he didn't want to make a fool of himself in front of the seasoned professionals. He wanted to win Michelle's regard, to make her proud. 

Michelle stiffened. She'd been vague on purpose, partly because she didn't know which of the people she'd been approaching over the last two months would accept the unusual request to come work on a top-secret project at the federal level. Partly because she wasn't sure how Chris would react. 

"Well, do you remember back when you got in trouble for flying above Alaska?" 

"Sure," he replied, smiling ruefully at the memory of the incident. 

"Part of your deal to work for the government was that you would have a high standard of personal protection and training while you were working with us. I've put together a team of four who will act as an investigative unit working closely with you at the BIA. As well, they'll oversee your safety in public situations." 

"Okay, I mean that doesn't sound too bad. I'm not sure how much babysitting I really need though." 

"I know that Chris, it's apparent that you're capable of defending yourself. It's always good to have extra eyes watching out though. Lillian can't be with you twenty-four seven," Michelle's eyes peaked open to see how he responded, even as he kept pampering her with big, dexterous fingers. 

"I understand, Michelle but who are they?" 

"Well they all come from a military or law enforcement background, several have spent time in both," Michelle sighed, she was going to have to fess up sooner or later. "They're all women." 

His hands stopped. 

"It wasn't actually my idea, Chris," she said hastily. "The psy-ops experts who have been studying what we know about Beings suggested it after looking over your case. They thought it would eliminate male ego from the equation entirely." 

"That's some bullshit, I get on just fine with guys... I think." Chris' brow creased in a deep frown. He wasn't sure why it upset him, perhaps because it suggested he wasn't mature enough to interact professionally towards both sexes. If they were worried about that they should keep human woman as far from him as possible. "What about Stephen or Oslo? Even Arvil. No problems there, I'd like to say we're friends." 

"I know that Chris, I even told the higher-ups so. They weren't worried about you so much as other men working with you. Something about how it would be hard for non-Being men to understand your relationship dynamic and the effect you can have on women. It would be hard to avoid jealousy, even if it was subconscious. Eventually that would undermine the team dynamic." 

Chris looked down at her upturned face, trying to gauge if she was pulling one over on him. She looked sincere, if upside down, as she looked up at him with an apologetic shrug of her shoulders. 

"Okay then, let's table that for the moment. I'll admit I'm by no means an expert in such things. It's a little insulting though." He resumed her massage, running his fingers absentmindedly up into her hair, stimulating her scalp. "Did you get a reply from the email you sent?" 

"I did," Michelle purred, delighted that he'd resumed with a decadent head-rub. She especially liked it when he took big handfuls of her black hair near the roots and applied gentle, consistent pressure for a few seconds. It was like the kneading paws of a cat. Melting down into the chair seemed like a real possibility in that moment. 

"And?" he asked. 

"It basically said, no goods no payment. I had to be cautious about spooking them. So, I told them to fuck off and go to hell. About five minutes later, I sent another saying I had cooled down and was willing to attempt another grab at you with the caveat that if I was successful the payment would be double. I'm waiting for a reply but I'm hopeful they will take the bait. If they do, we will hand you over and track you down to wherever they're hiding." 

"Sounds simple enough." 

"Simple?" Michelle complained. "I've been doing paperwork and tracking down the resources we'll need all afternoon!" 

"Enough," Annabel announced, coming to wrap her arms around Chris' big chest from behind. "If you're going to get my fiancé kidnapped on purpose, he needs to be well fed. Dinner's ready." 

"Okay, we can pick this up later," Michelle relented. "Thanks for the back-rub, Chris, I needed that." 

"Any time." 

Soon everyone was gathered around the table and Annabel produced pizza after pizza as they came out of the oven. Chris was especially impressed by an experimental pear, walnut, and goat's cheese topping, it was finished with fresh bitter greens and a balsamic dressing after it came out of the oven. Annabel said she'd had the idea for it from a salad recipe she'd seen in a magazine. 

Immi and Lillian arrived a little later, to catcalls from Claire, Petra, and Annabel. The sprite sheepishly asked to sit in his lap and apologised over and over for being tempted into divulging their bedroom secrets for a few measly morsels. She said she couldn't help it. As ever, Chris couldn't seem to hold it against her and was quickly feeding her little bites of pizza as she perched provocatively naked, straddling one of his powerful thighs. 

Soon after dinner, Chris was snuggled up with Susan and Annabel on the couch as they watched a little television. He was yawning regularly now and Annabel suggested he find Lillian and go to bed. Initially confused, she explained to him that she and Lillian had arranged for him to spend the first week of their new relationship together, exclusively. It was a privileged she hadn't even extended to Claire or Petra. He gave his two beautiful snuggle-buddies goodnight kisses and quickly did his toiletries before traipsing off to Lillian's room for some well-deserved sleep. 

He knocked softly but the door was already cracked ajar. Inside, a bedside lamp was set on dim, providing soft light to see the beautiful vampire waiting for him under the covers. She smiled at him, pulling aside the soft cotton top sheet to reveal her naked glory. Chris couldn't help the answering grin on his face as he bounded over like a playful whelp and slid in next to her. 

Wearing only a pair of silk boxers, he felt her mould around him. Every soft curve of femininity pressed firmly into him. One of her smooth, powerful thighs was soon draped over his. Her arms encircled him as he embraced her in turn, her hand running up into his hair as their lips met. When they parted, she crawled up the bed a little way until his head was resting in her magnificent, warm bosom. 

He thought she wanted him to start something so he kissed and lip-nibbled those perfect, sweet-scented breasts to his heart's content as his hand stroked up and down her flank. She simply crooned affectionate nothings and held him close until he eventually yawned right into her one of her big tits. She had to giggle at that. 

"Go to sleep, young one," she whispered.

*** 

The pale purple liquid glittered up at him out of the little vial cradled in his hand. Chris sighed and tucked it back into his short's pocket. 

He glanced at the air beside him again, knowing Lillian was walking in-stride and imagining the way her wide hips would no doubt be swaying. Invisible, it was distracting to even hear her unnaturally light footfalls as they walked through the underground connection to the Compound. 

This morning as she'd gotten up, she made sure to give him a show getting dressed. Chris hadn't really thought about how provocative watching a woman put clothes on could be. So far it had always been about getting them off. 

Watching her pull charcoal stockings up onto her silky thighs and clip them onto a lacy garter belt had made his cock tent the bedding obscenely. She only laughed and then wiggled her ass sexily into a navy pencil skirt that came up to the narrowest part of her waist, clinging to her figure. Next came some odd sort of doe-skin halter top which struggled to contain her breasts and left her arms bare. As she started slipping on her 'combat boots' as he liked to call them, he suddenly realised she wasn't going to be wearing any undergarments at all today. Her rather utilitarian black boots didn't really fit her outfit very well but the rest of the ensemble was so skin-tight that it didn't matter. 

Now all he could think about as he walked beside her on their way to meet Michelle was that she was completely commando. He had to struggle against the desire to drag her into some sort of secluded little alcove and ravage her. His cock was dangerously conspicuous down the side of his leg, throbbing in protest of the way he was working himself up. Meeting two members of the team Michelle was putting together with a pocket-hard-on was going to make him look like some sort of horny teenager... 

They met up with Michelle outside a small conference room just off the main reception area of the Compound. With her were two very unnerved women. 

Michelle introduced the first as Lisa Hess, a shortish Caucasian woman with quite a nice figure and very short, almost boyish brown hair. She wore a grey suit and Chris, ever the lecherous male, struggled not to let his eyes dip to assess her shapely body as they shook hands. 

The second was a tall, powerfully built African-American woman introduced as Katherine (Kat) Jackson. She was almost as tall as Lillian, who would be considered a giant of a woman. But where Lillian was voluptuous, Kat was all lean muscle and very obviously in peak physical condition. She looked quite young in the company of Lisa and Michelle. Perhaps it was her more casual attire of jeans, a white tank top, and some sort of dark leather riding jacket. When they shook hands, her grip was overly strong, like she was challenging him. Indeed, her brown eyes narrowed when he simply smiled back at her. He wondered what he'd done wrong to piss her off in the ten seconds they'd been aware of each other's existence. 

Lillian, still invisible, let out the tiniest hiss of disapproval at his side. 

Michelle noticed the little exchange and ushered them into the conference room where she'd set up a projector. Chris got a good look at Kat's backside in her skin-tight jeans and had to admit it looked superb, if a little slim for his refined taste. This time Lillian let out an affronted little grunt. He shrugged his shoulders. Perhaps his mysterious third heritage was pig? 

As with just about everything in the Compound, the room was richly decorated. The carpet extravagantly thick and soft, the chairs firm but comfortable. A huge oak table dominated the spacious room. The walls were a calming teal and the ceiling was mostly cream but had an incredibly detailed thin stencil pattern overlaid in green and blue. Two dim light orbs shone out from inlaid recesses, providing soft illumination. Neither woman seemed to have noticed that unusual magical detail. 

"Okay, you've both been given dossiers on the basic overview of our situation," Michelle stood with her tablet in hand as Kat and Lisa took seats opposite Chris around the oak table. Lillian stood behind him, invisible, her hands resting possessively on his shoulders. "Through somewhat dubious means, we have discovered the existence of magical Beings who have coexisted with us in secret for thousands of years." 

"Still ain't sure I believe it," Kat interrupted in her Atlanta accent. From her relaxed position in her chair, she seemed to be exuding bravado. 

"We'll take care of that today," Michelle smiled indulgently. "Anyway. You've accepted jobs here in Denver working under me in the youngest child agency in the Department of Defence family, the Being Interaction Agency. You've both got top level clearance as of this morning and you've signed your lives away with our strictest confidentiality agreements. Given your backgrounds and discipline, it shouldn't be too hard to keep your mouths shut for a few more months until we're ready to go public with the news. That is of the utmost importance." 

Everyone nodded agreement, uncontrolled release of that sort of information would be a nightmare. Both women had thoroughly read the briefings they'd been given. They sort of read like a fairy tale and were deliberately vague on specific details. However, the jobs they'd been offered were very real and paid very well. 

"Anyway. I brought you in early because someone in our broadening network of people in the know has failed to keep their damn mouths shut. As a result, we've ended up with a public gunfight in front of a popular Being nightclub here in the city. It was an attempted kidnapping of our resident delinquent here, Chris Baryst." 

Lisa's head cocked and her blue eyes were suddenly piercing him with a brutal assessment. 

"Christopher Baryst? Who supposedly took out three assailants and incapacitated two more in the middle of an automatic gunfight?" Lisa's superiors at the local FBI field office here in Denver had been trying to contact him for questioning ever since the club shooting and here she was in the very same room with him. 

"Guilty," he said a little sheepishly, feeling Lillian's grip on his shoulder tighten. 

"You've got some questions to answer if you wouldn't mind coming down to East 36<sup>th</sup> Ave with me after this?" only the way the smaller woman said it left no doubt that she wasn't asking at all. 

"Bup-bup-bup-bup, bup-bup," Michelle scolded, "Hands off my asset, FBI skank. Anyway, you work for me now and if I find out you're playing for both sides, even though we're technically on the same side, I will literally defenestrate the living shit out of your career. This is too important." 

Chris mocked swooning at his protector across the table and he felt Lillian relax again. Kat even had the audacity to chuckle at the special agent's bemused reaction. 

"He's all yours," Lisa relented. "Old habits, you know." 

"Yes, well, he's ours actually. As for you, young lady," Michelle looked meaningfully at Kat. "I've seen your Marine record. You might be just about the only woman to pass muster for dedicated frontline combat units but I won't tolerate any of your bullshit. You are not the hottest shit on this block let me assure you. I plucked you from a logistics base so you wouldn't die of boredom but I'm going to need you to keep an open mind and adapt on the fly. You've got a lot to learn." 

"Yes, Ma'am!" Kat stiffened, responding instinctively to the firm hand of authority. 

"Wait just a second," Lisa was thinking over the weekend's dramatic events with new eyes. "The club shooting was an attempted kidnapping and you say Chris here was both the target and an asset of yours... ours. But I've read his file, he's just some kid from up near Laramie. No offence." 

Chris pantomimed being stabbed through the heart. Michelle tried to keep it cool but ended up giggling unprofessionally, he could be so goofy sometimes. 

"Why don't you show them, Chris," she said. 

"What, like right here?" he looked around in concern. 

"Why not? Only go half way, obviously," Michelle encouraged. 

Seeing was believing with these types of indoctrinated professionals. She could remember back in the early days when Radek had been stringing them along with his bullshit, she hadn't truly believed in the existence of magic until she'd seen it with her own eyes. 

"But I'd have to take most of my clothes off," he glanced meaningfully at Lisa and Kat. 

"Show us what?" Kat asked suspiciously. "What's it got to do with him getting naked?" 

"God damn it, Chris, where is this modesty coming from all of a sudden? I've seen you strutting around in almost nothing plenty of times at home," Michelle pestered. 

"Fine," Chris stood up resentfully and began pulling his baggy black t-shirt over his head. "That's different though, Michelle." 

Lillian stepped aside and watched with interest. The two unknown women were about to get a shock. 

"Woah, woah, woah, what's going on here? You live with him? I don't think..." Lisa didn't finish her sentence as Chris pulled off his undershirt as well, revealing the rather impressive physique of his huge body. 

"Damn, you been eating your spinach, son," Kat murmured appreciatively. 

"Yes, Lisa, I live with Chris, I'm his Familiar," Michelle replied, as Chris' shorts came down and he kicked off the leather, desert-style shoes Annabel had recently bought for him. "It's a long story and I'll tell you all about it later. Just hold judgement and watch this." 

He stood up, his hands automatically moving to cover his junk, even though he was still wearing a dark green pair of boxer shorts. Michelle met his eyes and nodded encouragingly. He took a glance around and closed his eyes, the dragon came on eagerly. 

"What the... oh, shit!" 

"No fucking way!" 

He opened his eyes again, rustling his wings into a comfortable position. His enhanced sense of smell picked up adrenaline and fear as the two new recruits, now standing, stared at him in open-mouthed shock. There was also a flash of arousal coming from the concealed vampire over to his right. 

"Lillian?" He reached his hand out toward her. 

The air shimmered for a tiny moment before she was once again standing in front of them, smiling her predatory grin as she took his hand and pressed herself against his side once more. 

Kat let out a little 'eep' noise. 

Lisa reached for her ever present, trusty Glock 23 only to remember she'd reluctantly surrendered it when she'd entered the previously unknown underground structure that Michelle called the Compound. 

"Where the fuck did Jessica Rabbit come from?" Kat backed away, looking around defensively. 

"Remember the briefing material, ladies?" Michelle placed a calming hand on each of their shoulders. "This is the real deal, pornographic figure and all. This is Lillian, she can make herself invisible so that light passes through her. That's rather convenient for a vampire if you don't want the world's worst sunburn." 

"A... vampire?" Lisa stammered. "Holy shit it's real, it's all real." 

"Then what the fuck is he?" Kat pointed at Chris. 

"I'm a dragon." 

"Jesus," the Marine shook her head. 

"No, a dragon," Chris rumbled out a deep chuckle. 

"Are we, you know, safe?" Lisa eyed the pale goddess wrapping herself around the... the purple and cream coloured dragon-man? 

Lillian turned and bared her fangs at the FBI agent with a feral snarl, making her jump. 

"Cut that out, Lillian," Michelle admonished. "Yes, she's actually quite friendly once you get to know her. Just for God's sake don't let her push your buttons. I swear she is constantly goading people just to stave off the boredom of living for half a millennium." 

"You don't have to worry about little old me, I've got my favourite walking, talking, snack right here," Lillian turned and licked all the way up Chris' large bicep to his shoulder before sinking her teeth just barely through his tiny purple scales. 

"Ouch, cut it out, Lillian," Chris complained as she lapped at the tiny droplets of blood that welled up. 

"Oh, you poor baby," she cooed sarcastically back. "I could suck something else if you like?" 

"You'll have to excuse those two," Michelle guided the two stunned women gently back into their seats. "They've only just gotten involved... physically in the last few days. They're sort of in that 'honeymoon' phase." 

"Half a millennium?" Lisa murmured, putting her hand to her forehead as the enormity of what she'd signed up for sunk home. 

"Uhm, yeah, Lillian is apparently a little over five hundred years old, though she acts like a 21-year-old most of the time," Michelle shot the last toward the playful vampire. 

"What about him then, is he actually a dragon? How is that possible?" Kat followed up. 

"Well, Chris is just as old as his file says. He's nineteen and only came into his full dragon heritage about two and a half months ago under increasingly suspicious circumstances. Before that he was just a regular high school kid. It might not make much sense to you, but Chris is a very, very powerful Being and he's incredibly important to the survival of his species. You see, dragons have been hunted to the brink of extinction for their magical powers and he's one of only seven male dragons alive today. He's also unique in his ability to manipulate the Ether dimension, it's his dragon's aspect." 

The two women were listening but somewhat distracted by the increasingly amorous vampire's attempts at 'affection' and the young dragon's embarrassed rebuttal in front of the people he would have to be working closely with soon. Michelle scowled at Lillian but continued her explanation to the captive audience. 

"Anyway, as part of the deal I struck on his behalf for getting in trouble with the Missile Defence Agency over the skies of Alaska a while ago, he's contracted to work with us at the BIA. He's the first Being to accept such a position but we hope there are going to be many more, in fact, there will have to be. Your team of four will be working closely with him amongst other duties and ensuring his safety from non-magical threats. We're going to have plenty of time to answer all your questions and I've got some far more detailed files for you to read but right now we have a time sensitive operation underway. Which is why I called you in early... Hello? Earth to two drooling idiots. Come in?" Michelle clicked her fingers loudly and the two women started out of the enthralled state they were beginning to be sucked down into. Damn, his pheromones were working fast these days. 

"Um, sorry," Lisa blushed, looking away from the two amorous Beings. 

It seemed like Lillian had won out, they were now Frenching enthusiastically. 

"Would you two knock it off for five minutes?!" Michelle was exasperated. "I know you just want to hump like bunnies all day long but this is serious. Lisa and Kat are coming to terms with a lot and it would be nice if you could be professional if not helpful. I mean you've already gotten her pregnant for god's sake so at this point you're just being obnoxious as far as I'm concerned. Keep it in the damn bedroom." 

Lillian giggled coyly but they did separate. 

"Sorry," Chris apologised as they broke apart. Michelle was right, of course. He glared at Lillian for getting him in trouble, but she only winked and bumped her soft hip into him. To his mortification, he had the obvious beginnings of an erection tenting his boxers. 

"It's fine, Chris. I know you're hardly to blame. I think we're going to need that pheromone cancellation potion though." 

Lillian stuck her tongue out at her human friend. 

"Um, sure. It's right here," he bent down to retrieve the vial Susan had given him that morning and handed it across the table to Michelle. "Can I go back to normal and get dressed now?" 

"Yes, of course, Chris. I'm sorry for pushing you like that, I think I understand your reluctance now." 

"Oh, don't be such a spoil sport, Michelle," Lillian laughed. "Those two seemed to like the show." 

Michelle didn't reply, knowing the vampire couldn't be reasoned with when it came to teasing. Chris was already changing back into his human form and grabbing up his discarded clothes. 

"Okay, sorry about that," Michelle pulled up a chair and sat just behind the two women. "You'll learn to ignore Lillian most of the time. See what I mean about pushing your buttons? This is going to sound even more crazy than what I've put you through already but this is a magic potion. It is specifically tailored to cancel Chris' dragon pheromones. They're a naturally occurring part of his species' biology. Unfortunately, they seem to work on most other humans and human-blended Beings and are very effective at amplifying one's desires. That is why you may or may not be struggling with some irrational, intense feelings right now. One little dab of this potion under your nose will clear it up right away. It's perfectly safe, I do it myself every day." 

Both Lisa and Kat looked back and forth between Michelle and Chris, who shrugged. 

"Sorry guys, not much I can do about it except carry around a vial of PCP." 

"So what? He's like a walking date-rape? Man, you are a piece of work," Kat wasn't impressed as she took the offered vial from Michelle. She unscrewed the cap and placed her finger over the opening before upending it to catch some on her skin. Then she offered it to Lisa and wiped the finger under her nose. 

"It's not Chris' fault, Kat," Michelle explained. 

"Huh, smells sort of nice, like cinnamon. What do you know, a real magic potion," Lisa muttered as she too applied the potion and returned the vial to Michelle. 

Chris shook his head, thinking back to how that potion was made and imagining the pain he would experience if these two ever found out... let alone Michelle. 

"Okay, let's get back on track folks," Michelle clapped her hands to get everyone's attention and put up a screen on the projector with a large picture of Noel Redding. "This man was the ringleader of the kidnapping crew, an ex-Marine. We're trying to catch whoever has received illegal information about the existence of Beings and is now trying to kidnap them by hiring people like Noel. I suspect we are dealing with regular old, garden variety humans but we can't be sure. Chris' actions allowed us to capture Noel and one of his accomplices who have been cooperating with us so far. We have staged their escape from police custody and are using their email account to lure their employer out of the shadows, using Chris as bait. We are going into a delicate situation blind and undermanned. We don't know where this is going to take us so we're going to have to adapt on the fly, quite literally." 

What followed was several hours of briefings, contingency plans, and rules of engagement. Chris followed along intently, beginning to appreciate everything Michelle had organised over the past 24 hours. It was exciting to see her truly working in her element, not just the political and bureaucratic stuff she'd been focusing on lately. It reminded him of the time she'd arrested him at gunpoint in the middle of a crowded airport. Ahh, nostalgia. 

From the looks on Kat's and Lisa's faces, they were beginning to get over the shock of meeting their first Beings and paying close attention to the briefing. Good, he was going to be relying on all of them. They were going to be Lillian's backup on the ground when they managed to catch up to him.

--------------------------------------------
*** 

The beat up old Dodge van bounced over another rut and Chris had to stifle a grunt as his head knocked into the thinly carpeted floor of the stripped out rear compartment. His wrists and ankles were already sore, bound behind him in a hardened pair of prisoner transfer manacles. Lying in the back of that stupid van, he thought he must look like a trussed pig ready to roast. It wasn't a nice feeling. He hated this plan already and it had barely started. 

He couldn't see jack-shit and it was hard to breathe regularly through the blackout hood over his head. He was supposed to be pretending to be unconscious as they approached the exchange out in the middle of nowhere, forty minutes outside city limits. It was comforting to know that Lillian was somewhere there in the van too, but they were about to be parted. 

His throat was still sore and a little bruised from swallowing the small, smooth-polished, egg-like rock. Coloured obsidian black, it was supposed to allow the bearer of the second, paired stone to intuitively know the direction and distance between the two. Michelle had its pair. She, along with Lisa and Kat, were on standby at the airport awaiting Lillian's return, Lear jet fuelled and ready to track him down anywhere in the globe. 

"I wish we could just kill this human," Lillian's voice was so quiet he only just heard it. "I can't stand staying behind to mind him while you are left on your own." 

"It's okay," he whispered back, knowing she could probably hear him. "I'll be fine, Lillian. Plus, if this goes according to plan, you've got to guard one and a half million dollars." 

"I don't like it." It sounded almost petulant before she continued more gently. "Be careful young one, if something happens to you I'll... well let's just say the Vampire Council would have to send one of their elimination squads to stop me." 

He couldn't help smiling at her violent brand of affection. 

"I'll be careful. We'll catch these guys and be back home in no time." 

It was only a few more minutes on the bumpy track before they reached their destination. 

"Um... Get ready back there," Noel's uneasy voice drifted back from the cab. "I can see their vehicle." 

"Okay," Chris replied. 

Momentarily, he felt Lillian's soft body pressed firmly into him, her arm enveloping him. It would have been nice to be able to return her embrace but chained up as he was, it simply wasn't an option. 

"Good hunting," she whispered into his ear before she was gone. 

The van was braking to a halt and Chris took those last few moments to prepare himself mentally. He was supposed to be unconscious so he tried to relax, focusing on getting his breathing calm, steady, and shallow. He almost lost it to humour, thinking about the poor fool who had to try and carry his bulky body. 

He heard muffled voices and a sliding door on the other vehicle opened, then Redding spoke up. 

"Where's the money?" 

"Right here, you gonna count it?" 

Several dull thumps sounded, like something heavy was thrown onto the ground. 

Chris heard Noel open his door and get out. 

"Hey, what the fuck is that! You wearing a bomb vest?!" 

Several gun actions cocked, no doubt pointed at Noel and his fake suicide vest. That had been Noel's idea. He didn't trust the team hired to collect Chris not to kill him and take both the money and the valuable "package." 

"Calm down, calm down. It's just a little insurance. Don't want you guys getting any smart ideas about our equity situation. You weren't thinking about double crossing me, were you? Because if you were, this little dead-man's switch will take us all out," Chris had to admit that Noel was pulling it off. 

The vest was little more than a couple of wires, an old cell phone and some very real blocks of C4 explosive that Kat had rigged together. Despite its authentic look and the use of real explosives, all they could get on short notice, the vest was completely inert. Even if someone shot it, it would never go off without a detonator. 

"Naw, man, naw," the tone of the speaker's voice wasn't all that convincing, neither was the awkward pause which preceded his answer. "The boss won't be happy about this though." 

"Fuck that bastard," Redding hoiked and spat, he didn't have to act this part. "He's already screwed me and gotten half my crew killed. Not to mention my busted arm. You should break off after this job, man's an asshole." 

For Chris, it was strange to only listen to the goings on and have to lie still. He heard footsteps on the dusty gravel and a series of industrial sounding zippers being opened and closed in rapid succession. He presumed Redding was checking the money. 

"Ahh well, sorry about your boys," the stranger spoke. "It's all part of the job. Less ways to split the loot, am I right?" 

"Right," Redding's response was sour and dripping with sarcasm. 

"Hey now, how did you escape the police and get another shot at this kid? We heard he beat the shit out'a your team and you were headed straight for the slammer?" 

They had covered what Redding was supposed to say under questioning but it was a tense moment for them all to see if the other crew were going to buy his story. No doubt they were under orders to be vigilant of law enforcement involvement. 

"I got out because I have an outstanding arrangement with a few friends from the old days. They bust me out, I bust them out, you know how it is. As for the kid... well, let's just say shock and awe is not the right tactic to use with this one. You've dealt with some of these freaks before, sure. Not like this one you haven't. He's powerful, but I pumped him so full of tranquilizer, he'll be out for half a day. Alright, the money looks good enough, come get him." 

The door on the piece of shit van rolled reluctantly open, squealing all the way. Chris shut his eyes. This was it. Boots shuffled closer across the loose shingle. 

Strong hands gripped, dragged. He felt someone messing around with the blackout hood and he steeled his face into as relaxed a pose as possible, preparing to ignore any form of unexpected stimulus. His neck lolled, he even let a bit of spittle drool out of the corner of his mouth. Sunshine on his skin again, they were checking his identity. He held deathly still, just breathing calmly. 

"It's him boss," a deep voice he hadn't heard before spoke from right above him. Then the hood and darkness was returned. 

"Well hurry up and get him over here, we've got a plane to catch," the original stranger spoke up. 

The man was obviously very large and strong. Chris could feel his muscles straining as the man's arms looped under his own and partially lifted his deadweight. Chris' heels impacted painfully as he was dragged out of the van, the man was huffing and puffing above him as he was hauled unceremoniously across the loose, dry dirt. 

"Aww shit, Terry, I think he's almost as big as you!" another voice laughed. 

"Hey, fuck you. This motherfucker's bigger than me, he's is almost as heavy as your momma." 

"Man, why you gotta bring my mom into this? You know she's got diabetes." 

"You gonna' help or what?" Terry asked. 

An extra pair of hands gripped his legs and he was roughly swung up into another vehicle like an ungainly sack of potatoes. He had to stifle a gasp as some of the wind was knocked out of him. His shoulders burned and his wrists screamed protest as they were jostled uncaringly. The metal of the cuffs in particular was testing his limits of endurance. 

"A pleasure doing business with you," the stranger said seedily from what Chris now assumed was the driver's seat of his new captor's vehicle. Above him, the two men who had carried him caught their breath and began patting him down, searching for anything untoward. 

"Oh, I almost forgot, here are the keys to the manacles," Noel spoke. Chris heard the faint ring and clank of the keys flying before they were caught. "Now if you don't mind, get the fuck out of here." 

"Asshole," the stranger replied as the van's engine started into life and quickly began rolling forward, kicking up billow of dust into the dry air of the autumn afternoon. 

The road began bouncing him uncomfortably again as they sped up. Only this time, he was also assaulted by the smell of two sweaty men. They drove in silence for a few minutes, there was obvious tension in the air. The lackeys didn't want to speak up and potentially provide an outlet for their boss' frustration. 

"Fuck!" the driver sounded like he'd just punched the dash. "That could have been our money! That crazy asshole wore a bomb vest?!" 

"You got to give it to him for style though boss. I mean he got himself sprung from jail and leveraged it for double the original payment on the kid. Talk about turning a frown upside-down." 

"Shut up and dose the kid, Terry. I'm not taking any chances with these freaks." 

Chris' heart sank. This was one of their least preferable options. If he got drugged for real now, he would be at the complete mercy of his captors for the foreseeable future, possibly forever. It would be one hundred percent up to Michelle, Lisa, Kat, and Lillian to track him down and extract him from trouble. 

Michelle said it was his call. In this situation, it was up to him to decide whether to allow himself to be incapacitated or to abort the operation and hope the transfer team knew enough to lead them to the higher echelons of this conspiracy. That would take time, he wanted this whole incident to be put to bed and justice served swiftly. 

He swallowed nervously, banking on the magic of the little rock resting inside him and rolled the dice. 

A sharp prick against his skin. Then there was no need to pretend to be unconscious. 

*** 

Michelle took another glance out the window of the patrol car toward the modern, sleek building. Situated in a spacious, newly commissioned industrial park, it was clearly designed to impress. No expense had been spared in its construction. The entire north-facing façade was a giant wave-form of tempered glass, looking out across the perfectly manicured garden and extensive lawn. A crisp, unfaded flag even flapped proudly in a light breeze in front of the gilded sign near the entrance. It read Riker Pharmaceutical. 

She clutched the little onyx stone in her hand, feeling the connection to its partner flare bright in her mind's eye. There was no doubt, he was here, somewhere in the sublevels. Disturbingly, it seemed like he hadn't moved at all. She hadn't been sure what to expect when they tracked down Chris, but this wasn't it. It opened an entirely new and unsettling avenue of thought in her analytical mind. 

Despite its impressive, clean cut appearance, this was a top-of-the-line biomedical research facility. What's more, from her brief investigation, it was the boundary-pushing daughter company of one of the largest pharmaceutical giants. Incredibly well funded, tightly secured, lawyers up to the tits, and tied to some of the oldest, richest families in the country. This could get ugly. 

"Holy shit," Patty Hayse, their liaison with the Madison Police Department spoke in disbelief as her phone chirped. "Your warrant just came through." 

"That's to keep you happy, Patricia. I didn't really need one in the first place, we have exigent circumstances," Michelle said dryly. She could understand the Madison PD's reluctance to facilitate the search of such an institution without a warrant. In truth, the eight officers that had been reluctantly assigned to her would be helpful. They could help calm the no doubt oblivious employees of the company, especially security personnel. 

Michelle was more concerned with the Being inter-territory jurisdiction politics of operating in Minnesota. Reyla assured her it was fine. Seeing as New Orleans, the hub city for this territory, was so far to the south, the Lord was happy to let Reyla's agents follow their investigation into his own protectorate. This was practically the wild west of the USA Being society. 

"I still can't believe it," Patty muttered to herself. When the obviously driven woman had showed up at their headquarters earlier that day and demanded that she be assisted with a search of the influential pharmaceutical company's premises, the Madison PD had been understandably sceptical. Now here she was, reading a no-knock warrant for that same company less than two hours later. 

"Let's go!" Kat said enthusiastically from the back seat of the cruiser, opening her door. 

Michelle stepped out as well and looked the ex-marine up and down, shaking her head. The woman was loaded for bear, looking like she was stepping onto the front line of a war. She cut an imposing figure in her full body armour, molle webbing brimming with extra magazines, flash grenades, breaching charges... the list went on. 

"This is a civilian operation, Kat. We're trying NOT to shoot anyone, okay, especially with that thing," Michelle pointed to the short-barrelled AR-10 that Kat had pulled out of the back seat after attaching her Kevlar helmet and protective glasses. She had protested but Kat wouldn't budge on carrying the mighty weapon, insisting that someone on the team had to have an option for dealing with body armour or heaven forbid, hostile Beings. Michelle really hoped they didn't have to confront that possibility but admitted it was best to be prepared. The damn thing was the same calibre as a police sniper rifle. 

"Don't worry, I'll take lead," Lisa said as she and Patty got out on the other side of the car. "I'm more familiar with procedure." 

Michelle felt a bit better about that. She had confidence the recently former FBI agent would show adequate restraint when confronted. The newly trained soldier might not. Lisa was also an expert pistol marksman, having competed nationally for a few years after high school. She was notorious in FBI circles for once having shot a gun out of a suspect's hand. A slightly customised Glock 23 was currently holstered low on her right hip, another secured to her left thigh, a backup. 

Despite the heavily armed, highly trained members of their growing little team, Michelle knew their most lethal weapon required no firearm to be deadly. The vampire was bound to be somewhere nearby, lurking invisibly and itching with frustration to rush to the young man. 

"Lillian, don't do anything rash," she whispered to the air, praying the vengeful woman would hear and listen to her. 

Lillian did hear her, but couldn't promise not to follow her heady desire for retribution. It would all depend on what they'd done to her beloved dragon. She was very worried that he hadn't contacted them at all. 

Michelle secured her own helmet and weapon, clipping a compact, more manageable assault rifle into its sling. Patty was looking at them askance in their full armour as the other officers followed their lead and got out of their cars. 

"Have a squad car block the car park exit and a couple of officers cover the back in case anyone tries to sneak away," Michelle instructed as she started across the quiet street towards the building grounds. 

"Yes, Agent Hamund, I'm coming with you though," Patty quickly motioned two officers to comply with the instructions before rushing to catch up to the fierce looking trio. 

The young security guard at checkpoint just inside the door had clearly never been confronted with quite so much bristling, hostile firepower before. He stood agog as the glass parted and the armoured figures glided into his little world, a world in which he had previously been the utmost authority. It was his job to check employees and visitor's identity before they were let into the building. This was something completely new. 

"Federal agents, we have a warrant to search these premises," Lisa strode in first speaking clearly, confident but wary. Her hand rested casually on her hip, next to the unbuckled holster of her pistol. 

The metal detector blared angrily, sensing a vast amount of its intended target as the women walked up towards the front desk, followed by a small procession of police officers. The foyer was richly appointed, open, and modern. The atrium looked like it went up all the way to the top of the five-storied building. Huge planters, brimming with live growth of untold varieties hung suspended at various levels. Michelle wondered how on earth they were watered. It was a very impressive floating garden, which many a visitor had no doubt marvelled at as they waited for appointments below. 

They were almost at the worried looking receptionist's desk when a door burst open about thirty metres over to the right. Kat immediately raised her weapon, covering the startling appearance of a middle-aged man in a security uniform. He was armed too, a pistol on his hip. Behind him five more men appeared, swarming out of the security office like ants from a kicked nest. He hesitated momentarily, staring down the barrel of an assault rifle. He took in the officers behind the imposing figure of the dark-skinned woman and began walking towards them cautiously, his hand well away from his weapon. 

"What's this about, Patricia?" he asked, recognising the older police sergeant from his own days on the force. 

"Sorry, Richard. It's a search warrant," Patricia held up her phone, displaying the electronic copy of the warrant and gestured towards Michelle. 

"And what exactly are you searching for, Miss...?" he asked. 

"Agent Hamund, NSA," Michelle supplied. "We have reason to believe your company has engaged in kidnapping and is currently holding at least one individual against their will on the premises. Are you in charge of security here?" 

"Yes. But you're joking, right?" Richard scoffed, looking around for a smiling face to give away the prank. There was simply no way this woman was for real and since when was there an all-woman tactical team? 

"Afraid not, Richard," Michelle said. "I would appreciate your assistance providing access to the sublevels of the building so we don't have to damage the property." 

"I... I can't," he stammered. "I mean, I don't have access to the labs downstairs. There's sensitive research going on down there." 

"Take us there, now," Michelle said coldly as she began walking towards the elevators. She wasn't sure if the man was truly oblivious or this was some sort of stalling tactic. She pushed the call buttons on both and spoke to the assembled officers who were milling behind them. "Hold both of these elevators open and press the stop button when they get here. No one is to go up or down. Secure the lobby and contain everyone until we get back." 

"Now just hold on a minute you can't..." Richard started to protest. 

Michelle rounded on him. 

"You will provide assistance immediately or so help me I will throw the book at you, am I clear?" Her voice gave no room for further argument. "Unlock the stairwell." 

Kat, Lisa, and Patricia followed Richard over as he grudgingly held his card up to the reader on the door to the stairwell. It chirped happily and the magnetic lock clicked open. Michelle pointed Lisa and Kat forward. The FBI agent drew her pistol and took the lead, clearing the stairwell and proceeding downwards. Kat shadowed her perfectly, rifle poised and ready to reply to any threat. 

"You don't find it odd that the head of security doesn't have access to parts of the building? Who does have access?" Michelle asked as they headed down. 

"Not really," Richard said a little sulkily. He knew he hadn't done anything wrong, but he'd never been on this end of a search warrant, it wasn't nice. "I'm a glorified doorman. These guys do serious research and some of the equipment is very delicate and expensive, so I'm told. Only the executive staff and a dozen or so high-profile researchers have access down here." 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Is this it?" Lisa asked as they came across a heavy door marked B1. 

Michelle squeezed the little polished rock surreptitiously and felt the pulse of its brother coming from deeper below them. She shook her head to Lisa and they continued down. Patty and Richard shared nervous glances when Michelle waved them past the next level too. 

"This is it, open the door," Michelle said when they came upon the B3 landing. 

Things were much more utilitarian down here. The floors were a blueish grey linoleum which came halfway up the walls. The lights were fluorescent tubing, which flicked into life as a sensor detected their movement. One of the elevators serviced this level but the little lobby was completely barren. A pair of thick double doors led off into the unknown, wide corridor. It looked like a hospital. Michelle realised that was exactly the right comparison to make. The floor and even the walls were constructed to be easily washed. What exactly were they going to find? Her heart fluttered, and adrenaline began circulating her system as anticipation mounted. 

"I can't open those doors," Richard supplied quietly, sensing the tension in the three women. 

"Blow them," Michelle said, eliciting an excited little yip from Kat who quickly snuck forward to facilitate. It might be nice to have Lillian simply rip them off their hinges, perhaps after the Revelation such a thing might be possible. 

"Can't I just call whoever's in there on the intercom and ask them to let us in?" Richard asked reasonably. 

"No," Michelle said. "I don't want anyone thinking they can dispose of evidence." 

Kat hadn't had a chance to do anything like this since she'd completed her infantry training. It was exciting but a training course in IED disposal helped steady her hands as she unrolled the thick tape. The red, sticky side was covered with explosive warning symbols. She applied it face down to one of the doors near where it met the wall, covering from ceiling to floor in a continuous strip. She cut the length off with a knife and began again on the other door. With any luck, the charge-tape would simply shear the heavy door off at the hinges. 

She looked back to see Lisa covering her, the more experienced woman seemed indulgently disapproving at her obvious excitement. This job was way better than sitting around on base keeping track of inventory, she was going to enjoy it. With delicate care, Kat paired two wireless detonators for simultaneous explosion and pushed the sharp little teeth into the middle of each strip of tape. She did a quick double check, making sure the detonators were holding in place and the tape was sticking as it was supposed to. Secured, they both retreated into the stairwell with Michelle and the others. 

"You get me the best toys!" Kat thanked Michelle happily as they took cover behind the concrete wall of the stairwell. 

"There's something wrong with this one," Lisa smiled as they put plugs in their ears or in the case of Richard and Patricia, fingers. 

Kat was ready with her trigger device, awaiting Michelle's order. 

"I doubt we're going to come across resistance at this stage but just remember that our 'comrade' will be going in fast so be extra careful of friendly fire," Michelle looked at each of her new team members meaningfully. "Do it." 

The dull thump and back blast of fleeing air were only just registering with the human's senses as Lillian sprung forward from her concealed position and brushed passed Michelle. She leapt headfirst into the billowing dust cloud of shattered concrete. It clogged her senses and cut her vision unpleasantly but she pushed forward. One of the doors was crookedly blocking part of the corridor where it had fallen. She flicked it aside contemptuously with her telekinetic power, making it bounce and clatter further down the corridor. 

Above, five abused fire sprinklers spluttered into life in a chain, their delicate trigger mechanisms shattered in the small blast. Chilly water rained down on her, washing the dust from the air and partially off her face. She ran, desperate to catch a scent which would guide her to him. Behind, Lisa and Kat were only just coming out of the stairwell as she used her undead strength to boost her forward. 

Out of the thinning dust, another set of doors just like the last loomed in front of her. She could not wait for the others clear the obstacle. Surprise was lost, she must act. Even as she charged invisibly forward she formed her gift into a sharp telekinetic wedge, reinforcing and holding it steady barely a foot in front of her. Her gift would be the knife, her body provided the momentum. 

The screeching wrench of buckling steel echoing up the corridor was all Michelle and the others heard as Lillian popped the reinforced doors like a can of tomatoes. Beyond, the vampire streaked through a white corridor, scenting the air as she passed. Through windows on each side of the hallway, she caught glimpses of various laboratories. Some were occupied by a few lab-coat-wearing scientists, others dark, abandoned. Ahead, the corridor ended in a blank wall. 

A whiff of cinnamon in the air. It brought her up short, skidding to a halt. It was very faint but she backtracked, shutting her eyes to focus entirely on catching another trace of him. Her legs guided her automatically until she bumped clumsily into a wall. Vengeance burned hot inside as her eyes snapped open. She was up against the glass of one of dark laboratory rooms. 

Up and down the corridor, doors began opening as curious, worried humans poked their heads out to see what the commotion was. Lillian only had eyes for her target, but the door was stubbornly locked and reinforced. It was risky now that she had an audience but she trusted her invisibility charm to keep her hidden. She stepped to the right and swung her fist directly at the locking mechanism of the reinforced door with all her considerable might. Even using her telekinesis as a protective layer, she felt several of her extra strong bones crack in the resounding impact. The door was shaken but stubborn. She gritted her teeth and punched again. This time the door frame buckled satisfyingly under the incredible impact but white-hot pain lanced up her arm in response. 

Lillian cradled her shattered wrist, taking measured breaths against the pain as she slunk forward, unstoppable in her resolve. The pain served to fuel her hunting instinct, her rage at the perpetrators of this injustice. Not only had they nearly killed her, they were trying to foist him away. Even now, her wounded tissues were re-knitting, siphoning from the rich pool of life energy she'd slurped from the dragon's neck in their last encounter. In minutes, she would be as good as new. Besides, she had endured far, far worse than this. 

Her enhanced vision let her easily see that the dark laboratory was completely deserted. Still, his scent was stronger here and growing thicker as she approached a sliding door at the rear of the room. What's more, her attentive hearing began detecting muffled noises, the hum of machines? 

Her good hand slid the door gently aside, revealing a small space dominated by several expensive looking microscopes draped in transparent dust covers. Yet another door stood in front of her, blocking her way at the other end of the little room. A quiet growl of exasperation escaped her throat. With only a small space to gain momentum, she would have to punch or kick her way through this one as well. That didn't sit right with her, sustaining further injury would leave her ill prepared to face whatever waited on the other side. On the off chance, she tried the door handle. 

To her happy surprise, it depressed easily and swung inward. Over-warm air washed across her, thick with the smell of him. The telltale scents of other Beings registered with her subconsciously but were disregarded as irrelevant for the moment. 

What she saw set every tiny hair on her skin bristling. An involuntary shudder of goose-flesh rolled down her back. This was exactly the reason Beings feared humans and their Revelation. 

Two short rows of naked bodies, trapped, sedated in clinical-looking metal frames. She could only assume they were Beings, half-standing listlessly in their restraints. They looked unconscious, she couldn't scent the death notes of any corpses. Various tubes snaked over their skin, hooking multiple IV bags into their circulatory systems at the arms and neck. 

Other cables connected various pads and sensors to sophisticated monitoring equipment. Each harness boasted a large screen to display vital information in detail all but the most well-equipped hospital would find worthy of envy. Thick stainless-steel bands locked around their limbs, head, and chest at strategic points. The harness held them completely captive in an almost standing position, tilted just slightly backwards so they didn't slump down. 

Even had they been conscious to protest their treatment, only the most physically enhanced or magically inventive Being would have a chance of escaping that cage. Lillian doubted that she could manage it, she would barely be able to wriggle. The poor souls were even fitted with catheters and bags to collect their waste, showing that their captors had no plans to let them free in the near future. 

Her eyes quickly found the bulky form of Chris at the end of one of the rows and relief washed through her. 

Movement behind him stirred her from her shock. She dove forward, pouncing like a big cat with an enraged snarl on her lips. She dropped her invisibility charm as she flew forward, wanting to see her prey's fear before she ended their pitiful existence. 

She was too late. Even as she rounded his body she saw the greying woman in a lab coat pushing the plunger of a syringe to completion in the muscular tissue of his sculpted, unconscious butt. 

Lillian's good hand closed on the old woman's throat, lifting her effortlessly, slamming her into a nearby bank of storage cupboards and pinning her. Glassware fell from a nearby shelf at the impact, shattering musically on the laboratory floor. Her other fist raised back automatically, ready to end the woman's life with a slash of her vicious black claws. Instead of fear, Lillian saw defiance in the woman's blue eyes, she even managed to smile manically down at the vampire who was throttling her.  

Lillian cursed, recognising that look. She let the woman slide down, so her feet touched the ground. 

"What have you done to him!" she demanded, letting her grip loosen so the woman could breathe. 

Instead of answering, the woman began laughing. 

Lillian set a steely grip on her raging vampire instincts, retracting claws and fangs. There were simply some people out there who didn't respond to intimidation. You came across them occasionally, especially in her line of work. The tough nuts that didn't crack. Why? Because they were literally nuts. Insane, psychopathic, whatever. She had grown to recognise it in her five hundred years and this older woman oozed it. Laughing was not the healthy, terrified response humans and even Beings should display when confronted with the might of a vampire. 

Her eyes narrowed, sweeping up and down the woman's body. If she had to guess, the woman was in her early sixties. Her face was beginning to truly wrinkle yet her relatively tall body still clung to a certain lean, spritely strength that Lillian instantly knew was maintained with rigorous exercise. 

She turned the woman forcibly into the wall and began searching her pockets and patting her down. The last thing Lillian needed was a poke with a mystery syringe. Her search yielded a phone, wallet, ID card, keys. Nothing nefarious. 

She held the now chuckling woman by the back of her neck in an unyielding grip as she began rifling the contents of the woman's wallet. 

"Dr. Emilia Mayer," Lillian stated with false calm, attempting put aside her simmering anger. "Would you be so kind as to explain what you've injected into this man?" 

She manhandled the doctor like a kitten, by the scruff of her neck. They turned to see the syringe still impaled in Chris' rump, drooping down now that only the thick needle was holding it in. It looked painful. The doctor didn't resist, composing herself as best she could. 

"Ah, yes. What a truly marvellous specimen. I take it you know young Chris?" She asked almost conversationally, as if nothing was wrong. 

"I... Yes," Lillian didn't bother trying to lie. She also noted the traces of a European accent, long overwritten by years living in the States. 

"Quite intimately by your reaction, I suspect," the doctor continued. Lillian was silent, watching and listening. Sometimes it was best to just let the nuts talk, let them assume they had some control and see how things played out while watching them like a hawk. "You'll be relieved to hear he's in no immediate danger. I heard the commotion outside and put my little insurance policy into play. I warned Patrick that attempting to capture him was a mistake, but the man is just too greedy to see reason." 

"Insurance policy?" Lillian accused. 

"Well of course, dear," the doctor said almost maternally. "I knew it was only a matter of time before someone came looking for Chris. We might have gotten away with the others but as soon as I began running my tests I knew you couldn't just snatch someone so powerful off the street and expect to get away with it." 

"Actually, he volunteered to be handed over to your lackeys in order to lead us to you," Lillian attempted to put the woman off balance. "Your first attempt to capture him was a disaster. We caught the remaining members of the team and turned them to find you." 

"Hmm," Emilia cocked her head as much as she could in the vampires grasp as if assessing Chris' caged body in a new light. "Valiant. I have injected him with a toxin-antitoxin cocktail. The toxin is long lasting but the body breaks down the antitoxin in just a few days. He will require regular injections of the antitoxin and blood dialysis for up to a month until the poison clears his system. At least a human would." 

"Clever," Lillian admitted, reaching out to gently pull the hanging syringe out before it caused too much bruising. "What do you want?" 

"My life," she said matter-of-factly. 

"Of course." 

"And one other thing, I want in. My eyes have been opened to new and exciting possibilities, I cannot simply go back now that I know of your world." 

Lillian thought on that for a moment, her mind blocking out the hum of machines and monitoring equipment. This was a little unexpected. She had expected the human to ask for absolution and freedom. Instead she wanted further down the rabbit hole. It was situations exactly like this one where memory read and erase had proved invaluable in the past. She smiled ruefully. Intelligent, driven, and ruthless, the doctor would have made an excellent vampire. 

"It's ironic, you know," Lillian spat. "You've just poisoned the only Being I know who might have the inclination, compassion, and power to offer you clemency and protection." 

That shook the scientist, Lillian watched her eyes widen for a moment before she regained what composure the situation allowed. 

"That's unfortunate. May I ask your name, vampire?" Emilia asked as Lillian glared down at her. 

"Lillian." 

"Okay, Lillian. I simply ask that you think about this rationally. I did not do this intentionally to harm him. I have no desire to see any of these people hurt, I just want to continue my experiments. I have uncovered an entirely new branch of medical science just from examining their cells. The morphing capabilities of the were-species is fascinating. Young Chris has incredible innate regenerative abilities and at this very moment, that machine over there is testing his cells against the most virulent pathogens known to man. I have no doubt his immune cells will fight them off without trouble. Ha! I assume you know this but he produces the most intoxicating pheromones. A few hours after he was delivered, I couldn't figure out why I was getting uncontrollably hot under the collar. I'll admit to finding him attractive but never had I found myself so helpless against such feelings of desire. It was a delightful puzzle which I solved with the help of my trusty mass spectrometer. I have discovered more in the last month studying these people than in my previous lifetime devoted to research. Sorry, I'm getting side-tracked. I say these things to show you that I don't intend you people harm. I chose Chris to carry out my insurance policy simply because he is obviously the most valuable, the best chance for getting the deal I want. It isn't personal." 

"It's always personal to someone," Lillian said coldly as she heard the approaching footsteps of Michelle and her team. "Not only did you poison my lover, you have already kidnapped other Beings to carry out your experiments. Do you think they would willingly submit to this existence for the sake of your discoveries? You are a sociopath at the very least. And all this in a delicate time when we are trying to peacefully merge our worlds. If what you have done here becomes public knowledge in our world it would spark a powder keg." 

"Politics," Emilia shook her head distastefully as Lisa emerged from the darkness at the other end of the room followed by Kat, focused intently on clearing the room. "I don't care about any of that. I have kidnapped no one, that's the work of our illustrious executive staff. I would just as soon perform my tests on willing, cooperative subjects if they were available to me. They are not. I am not the mastermind of some evil conspiracy against you. I'm simply a brilliant scientist who had the wool pulled from my eyes and didn't let an opportunity for discovery slip through my fingers." 

"Maybe," Lillian admitted. "But you're also a remorseless bitch of the highest calibre." 

"Things must look nice and clear-cut from up on that high horse, vampire," the doctor smiled cautiously. "I suppose your kind is blameless of atrocity?" 

Lillian glowered but remained silent as a bedraggled, damp Michelle entered the room behind the professional sweep performed by Lisa and Kat. The damaged sprinklers were obviously still trying their best to extinguish a non-existent fire out in the corridor. She paused inside the threshold, wiping damp, dark hair from her face as she assessed the room and its occupants. Her eyes hovered on Lillian, Chris, and the mysterious older woman. Her shoulders slumped, relieving a titanic load of tension she'd barely been aware of carrying. 

"Oh, shit," Richard murmured behind her, catching sight of the unconscious figures held in futuristic restraints. Up until then, he hadn't believed the agent's claims could be possible. 

Michelle spun on her heels to face the astonished head of security and police liaison. 

"Okay," She spoke almost tenderly to soothe their reeling minds. "Please secure the corridor and keep the other scientists calm. We'll take it from here." 

"I didn't... I have to call this in, my superiors..." Patty's eyes looked a little glazed over as she reached for her radio to call in the disturbing scene in front of her, acting in some sort of dazed autopilot. 

"No, this needs to remain discreet," Michelle said more firmly, stopping the policewoman's hand and turning her away from the unsettling scene of the caged, lifeless-looking bodies. She ended up guiding both Patty and Richard back through the dark laboratory and out into the corridor. "Neither of you have the clearance to get any further involved and trust me, you wouldn't want to. I'm going to make some calls and get a few more of our people flown in but we can handle it until then. If you want to help, start evacuating the building and sending the other employees home. We've found what we came for."

Chris stirred, his inner dialogue feeling sluggish. The dragon's thoughts felt distant, blurry, sleepy. It was confusing, as if a heavy blanket of fog had him imprisoned in a chilly embrace. However, there was an infallible sensation that the sun was slowly burning its way down to free him. His limited consciousness moved listlessly, not comprehending much except the slow return of self-awareness. 

Movement against his left side drew his attention to the warm presence of someone close to him. He felt instinctively comforted. Murmured noises of reassurance sank down through the mist to him, he felt a tender caress through his hair. A faint scent, Annabel. 

He struggled to stir something meaningful from his sluggish body again, but it was no use. His limited capacity for reasoning told him if she was there, it must be okay. He relaxed, lay back and let it come. 

Her voice came to him softly, somehow full of love, pride, and concern all at the same time. 

"Rest, my brave, beautiful dragon." 

*** 

Michelle's eyes squeezed shut tightly as she looked away from the screen. They were stinging, red, and dry, protesting their extended abuse at the hands of huge screens in her new office. She rubbed and pinched the bridge of her nose reflexively, a habit from the days not long ago when she'd needed glasses. Thankfully, it still gave some measure of relief. 

She focused her eyes away, out of the window of her new 6<sup>th</sup> floor corner office. They jumped from lamp to lamp down the relatively quiet late-night street arrayed below. There wasn't much to hold her attention so it wasn't long before she was back to watching the screens. 

It was late and she had the lights off, letting the ambience from the street and the harsh glare of the monitors mix. She'd sent Kat and Lisa away hours ago, there wasn't anything they could really contribute at this stage. They were still settling into a new city and needed all the personal time she could allow them. Now her only company was a vampire. She shook her head, how her life had changed. 

On the displays before her, a man was about to get away with it. His power, his money, his family's ties; he'd used it all and it was working. 

She'd passed this problem to her higher-ups and no one had the balls to dish the beatdown this criminal deserved. And the man was a criminal. However rich or connected he might otherwise be, there was no doubt in her mind about that. If the confession of his pet scientist wasn't damning enough, the evidence she'd collected once she had access to his company's electronic records was irrefutable. 

Still, the issue got bucked back and forth as the justice system bickered about who landed with the responsibility for charging him. No department wanted the category 5 legal shit-storm that would promptly rain down on them if they filed charges. This was old American money. 

There was good reason to be wary too, if they pushed too hard, he could blow the whistle about the Revelation. They were sitting on a proverbial grenade, he had his greedy hands on a string attached to its pin. One little tug and he would be the least of their worries. 

She let out a sigh of bottled frustration. It wasn't her first. Two hours ago, she'd tracked him enroute to a private airport. Now, he was going to get away. 

"Let me deal with this," Lillian spoke quietly from the armchair in the corner. 

"I can't, that's not how we do things," Michelle's response was mechanical, they'd had this discussion before. 

"He's guilty?" the vampire whispered, her Russian lilt making Michelle's lips twitch in exhausted amusement. She couldn't help it if the vampire sounded like some FSB counterpart trying to lure her to treason in times gone past. For all she knew, the vampire might have been at some point. 

"Yes, but the system..." 

"Screw your system," Lillian hissed. "I have let you handle this so far but he is slipping from your grasp. It's time you let me deal with this. Our way." 

The problem was, Michelle didn't disagree. 

Beings brought them the power to serve justice in an entirely new dimension. Was truth syrup or mind reading a violation of human rights? Maybe. But by all accounts, they had already been stealthily putting these tools to use on the broader population of the planet for several thousand years without ill effect. Why shouldn't they use these resources now, when so much hung in the balance? 

But that wasn't entirely true. She'd been encouraged to use magical resources and a heavy hand in her new role when dealing with hired thugs. Now she watched as wealth and influence tipped the scales in the criminal's favour. Lillian was right. Screw the system; if this was possible, the system was broken. Not just their justice system either, entire elements of their society. 

She supposed she knew that already in a way. Why did people and companies pillage the environment? Why did famine and war still exist? Why did people kill each other over ignorance, intolerance, or ideological belief? People were shitty if they could get away with it. Society allowed for it. Being society wasn't much better from what she'd seen, the wealthy and powerful still got away with things they shouldn't. However, with their magical tools at her disposal she felt like she almost had the ability to do some good in human society. If she'd been allowed to. 

Now this man was going to get away with kidnapping and murder. She had the power to do something about it but only if she bucked her yoke. 

<em>Okay,</em> she thought, her lips twitching but not saying it, gathering courage. 

"Okay," she spoke. It still came out reedy and quiet before she cleared her throat and continued. "Okay, but we wait until Chris is on his feet. I need another moral compass on this, I don't trust mine and I suspect yours is completely fucked." 

*** 

When Chris finally surfaced through that fog, he found himself in an unfamiliar, rather stark room. 

He was groggy and stiff but otherwise not obviously the worse for wear. His eyes roamed the unfamiliar ceiling for several confusing moments as he wondered where he was, searching for recent memories. It was his nose that finally told him he was back in Denver, somewhere in the Compound. It also told him that Petra was near. 

He sat up cautiously from what he discovered was a rather luxurious, oversized hospital bed and looked around. A curtain partitioned part of the room and he wondered if there was another patient in there with him. Cables of all kinds hooked on and into him. A strange sensation let him know there was something going on with his penis. He surreptitiously lifted the sheet and pulled aside his cotton gown to look. Yup, there was a catheter tube leading from his tip off over the edge of the bed. 

It was a bit dismaying to wake up like that. Most concerning though were the thicker tubes of dark fluid leading from his forearm to a whirring machine next to his bed. He thought he recognized the slowly spinning circles from a TV show or something. It was filtering his blood. 

"What the hell?" he mumbled hoarsely, his voice raspy, unused. 

A rustle of cloth alerted him to someone behind the curtain. A moment later, a beaming Petra ducked around the partition and came to him. She was a sight for sore eyes. For some reason he felt himself starting to choke up with emotion, his throat thick and painful. 

"Shh, shh, shh," Petra saw his distress. She sat on the bed beside him and took him gently in her arms, nuzzling her face into his neck. "It's okay. You're okay. We're all safe." 

"What happened?" he croaked, squeezing her, holding on desperately. The familiar scent of her almost silver hair bringing comfort. 

"Michelle and Lillian came and found you. You and some other Beings were sedated and being experimented on. Before they could free you, the woman who was doing the experiments used you as a bargaining tool to stay alive. She poisoned you, Chris."  

"Poisoned?" Chris's astonishment was clear, separating their bodies a little. "So that's what the dialysis machine is for." 

"Yes. It was some sort of nasty cocktail she designed. Very clever, that woman, but very dangerous, too. She's been giving you the antidote for the last few days. Lillian comes close to deciding to kill her at least once every few hours I'm sure." 

"Days! How long have I been out?" he asked, pulling back to look at her. "How are the girls?" 

"We've been worried about you but everyone's fine, Chris," she laughed happily at his concern and placed her hand over his heart. "This is the fourth day since Michelle and Lillian brought you home. We've been taking shifts staying here in case you woke up. No one really knew when you would." 

"Oh, okay. Does this mean I'm cured?" 

"We don't know. The woman, Emilia, said it could take up to a month to clear a human's system. Hopefully it will be less for you. Lillian says she can taste it in your blood still." 

"Well that sucks. Did we at least catch the bad guys?" 

"Umm... sort of?" She smiled, reaching up to smooth his frown away with her thumb and run a hand lovingly through his blond hair. "It's complicated. Michelle and Lillian can explain it all to you. They found the other kidnapped Beings though, so I call that a win." 

"I feel stupid. I never should have let them knock me out like that." 

"Maybe, maybe not. It's in the past so all you can do is learn from the experience," she consoled. "Hey, I've got something which might cheer you up." 

"What?" 

"Well, Claire and I are only about a week apart and the doctor said it would be okay if we had our first antenatal check-up together. We were hoping you might want to come?" 

He took her back in his arm again, hugging more gently this time. 

"Of course I want to come," he murmured in her ear, kissing softly into her scalp. "I love you all so much, my two dragonesses and our little belly-bumps. Are you showing any more yet?" 

"A little." She found his lips and kissed him passionately, making sure her own love was known. Then she pulled away and stood, leaving him reaching for her, cables dangling. "Want to see?" 

"You know I do," he grinned, starting to feel lecherous once more. She was doing a fantastic job of taking his mind off being stuck in a hospital. 

She ran her hands sensuously down her sides and over her hips, watching him follow her smooth movements. Her fingers gently tugged at the buttons of her light blue shirt, eyes never breaking contact with his as one by one, she opened a gap over her tummy. Her hands slipped delicately inside to caress soft, creamy skin. 

Chris shifted, eager to see underneath her shirt. Merciful as she was, she stopped her teasing and pulled the cloth aside to reveal her barely evident pregnancy. 

"It is bigger," he said in awe, reaching toward his unborn child. 

Petra came closer, insides melting into gooey affection at his reverent look. His rough, calloused hands were so gentle when they finally touched, sending a frisson up her spine. 

"He," the dragoness announced proudly. 

"He?" Chris looked up questioningly. "How do you know?" 

"He feels like a boy. I can sense him inside of me now, so strong, just like his father," she radiated love and pride to her young mate, placing her hands on top of his own. "We'll find out for sure in another month and a half's time." 

Chris looked back down, feeling her warmth, her softness, the contour of her small bulge. He had done this. He had put his seed inside this beautiful woman, his mate. They had shared body and soul to make this wondrous new life. He couldn't help but be aroused. She was so gorgeous, especially like this. His cock twitched, coming to life with an astonishing vengeance. 

"Petra I... That's strange... Fuck! Oww! Shit!" he yelped. 

"What's wrong?" 

"I'm getting an erection and it feels really weird with the catheter," he whipped off the sheet but paused, unsure what to do about it now that his raging cock was exposed and free. His hands hovered over it, indecisive. Could he pull it out himself? 

Petra laughed. He looked so funny, whipping back the sheets and looking dismayed to find his big cock pulling angrily at the dangling tube like a leash. She managed to clamp her hand over her mouth and reduce it to a few muffled giggles. For a moment she'd worried something was really wrong with him. Typical of her young mate, he was simply too randy for his own good. 

"Damn you, woman," he couldn't help chuckling himself, infected by her honest mirth. "This is your fault anyway, you're too god damn sexy." 

"Poor you," she crooned, paused, and began laughing again. "Wait until the girls hear about this!" 

"Go get a nurse or something. Please, Petra!" 

"Okay, okay. Sorry, dear." 

She was still laughing as she tucked her shirt back in her black jeans and went in search of professional assistance. Chris sighed, shook his head, and leaned back down in the bed, still throbbing and decidedly uncomfortable. 

With her previous experience in nursing, Petra could probably have attempted to remove it herself. However, Chris was not under her care. It could be considered quite rude to Dr. Chang for her to start pulling tubes out of his patient. 

She was actually very impressed with what she'd seen of the Compound's medical expert. A lot of Beings in the medical profession fell behind keeping up with human advances in medical science. That was easy enough to understand as they tended to focus on magical means of healing their patients. 

Dr. Chang, however, understood the value of being fluent in both languages of healing. The sponsored practice was small, consisting of himself, two nurses, and a technician. However, it was outfitted with as much of the latest medical diagnostic and laboratory equipment as it could hold. Petra had learned that it was part of the deal he'd struck with Reyla when she headhunted him from the west coast territory to service her own. 

It was good to know that Chris' care was in the hands of a competent doctor, someone who could actually understand what his body was fighting against with this darkly crafted poison. Petra didn't trust Emilia Mayer one bit, and Lillian wasn't the only one who bristled when she was escorted to Chris' bedside every morning to administer the 'antidote'. Someone who designed and used such a tactic without remorse could never be left unsupervised. It was like having a pet scorpion, all well and dandy as long as it was securely in the terrarium. 

It was only now, with Chris awake, that the dragoness conceded that the mad old scientist might be keeping her word, for now. 

When Michelle and Lillian had dragged the researcher back with them from Wisconsin, Petra had been sorely tempted to rip the woman's head off and trample her lifeless body under giant draconian paws. It galled her to think that Reyla had struck a deal with the ruthless woman. Vassalage and Chris' uneventful recovery in exchange for amnesty, protection, and the rest of her life in 'productive detention.' 

If all went smoothly, Dr. Mayer would soon be continuing her research under Reyla's supervision. It was almost exactly as she'd planned when she first poisoned Chris and that galled most of his brood. Petra's only comfort was that Reyla was probably enough of a ruthless, cold hearted bitch to handle the doctor. 

"Ruth?" Petra asked as she approached the receiving room and found it empty. 

"In here Ms. Godran, one second," the nurse poked her head out of the breakroom. "I'm just warming some food for our patient. I saw on the monitor's that he's awake." 

Petra grinned evilly, thoughts of Emilia Mayer discarded at the prospect of teasing the poor nurse. Ruth, a lovely water elemental had been particularly fussy and attentive to Chris ever since he'd arrived. The dragoness was positive Ruth was indulging in the effects of his pheromones. It was going to be wonderfully fun to see how she handled Chris' current little situation. 

"Thank you, I'm sure he's going to be hungry but first we're going to need an ice pack." 

*** 

Chris expected to be up and about as soon as all the tubes could be pulled out of him. Checking on Stephen and the three goblins was at the top of his list. He couldn't wait to see their progress and they were probably desperate for a crystal refill by now. He also needed to get down to Michelle's office and get a proper update on everything that had happened while he was out. From Petra's brief recount, he owed Michelle, Lillian, Katherine, and Lisa a thank you for coming to rescue him so quickly. 

No-nonsense Dr. Harold Chang shattered every one of his hopes and plans. Chris was to stay in the clinic around the clock until the doctor was satisfied the poison was sufficiently scrubbed and filtered from his body. It would probably take a minimum of a week. Worse, he was to stay supine as much as possible and avoid exertion. Tests showed that his liver and kidneys were working overtime at the moment and therefore stress of any kind was to be kept to a minimum. The doctor thought his body would handle the toxin better if it stayed in a low metabolic state, hooked up to the dialysis machine as much as possible. Chris was sorely tempted to vanish into the Ether and avoid any further encounters with the blunt doctor-wizard. 

He might have, if Petra hadn't looked so concerned as the doctor described his situation. His mates were counting on him to make a swift and full recovery, so he would. The only good news was that the big dialysis tubes would be coming out for the rest of the day and overnight to assess his condition and allow him to sleep safely. 

Word soon spread that Chris was awake. He spent the rest of the day catching up with his lovely ladies, each stopping by as their schedules allowed. Claire came down from the hotel suite to see him right away, snuggling up against his side and kissing him very tenderly. While her mother appeared stoic, the younger dragoness was obviously rattled. He squeezed her tight, playing a soothing hand through her beautiful red hair. Unable to promise to stay away from dangerous situations in the future, he settled for wrapping her in his arms and holding her, safe and cherished. 

Susan and Annabel showed up for about an hour at lunch with Immi in tow. They brought a selection of delicious treats and fresh fruit they'd picked up at a local deli on the way. Chris was ravenous. This backfired on his two mates, as he gave only a quick moment of intimacy to each of the women before attacking the contents of the hamper they brought. Annabel and Susan smiled at each other as he inhaled a whole packet of salmon avocado sushi and dug into the rest, sure that his appetite was a sign of his returning health. 

Immi hadn't grown noticeably but Chris was surprised to see her wrapped, somewhat immodestly in a piece of white silk. Despite making her look like some sort of painted virginal sacrifice, he had to admit any sort of clothing was a big step for the little sprite. Despite her hate of 'scratchy' clothes, silk was apparently tolerable. Besides, she had to practice for when she was bigger. 

Chris noticed that she seemed a little subdued from her usual bubbly self as she sat on one of Annabel's thighs and nibbled with disinterest at a ripe strawberry he shared with her. Just before Annabel and Susan had to leave, Chris remembered that the pint-sized little princess was probably very hungry for something else. She chirped her delight as he apologised and drew on his magic to condense it into a golf-ball sized nugget of sprite food. Newfound manners forgotten and speaking around mouthfuls, Immi proclaimed her thanks but described in pornographic detail how she would have preferred he feed her. Everyone laughed as her vivid imagery brought redness to Chris' cheeks. 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
As he kissed Annabel goodbye until the evening, he made another little lump of magic for Bartholomew. Immi eyed the little tattoo jealously, but the morsel was devoured so quickly she didn't have time to intercept it. The sprite collected a smooch of her own before climbing up on Annabel's arm and slipping delicately into the wide mouth of Annabel's calf-leather handbag, disappearing completely. Chris stared wide-eyed in wonder at the blatant use of magic. There was no way that should be possible. How had she done it? Annabel laughed happily at his reaction, shrugged as if to say, 'what of it?' and left. Susan kissed him goodbye and followed her out, collecting the meagre, dragon-savaged remains of their lunch to dispose of. 

Claire and Petra departed around two in the afternoon after a delightful little dragon-nap nestled one on each flank. It was a squeeze, but thankfully they just fit if the ladies lay on their sides. They left with no real explanation but suspiciously knowing smiles, putting him on guard. His prime suspicion was that some sort of invisible shenanigans with Lillian were afoot. 

Quiet footsteps in the hallway alerted him to someone's approach. It didn't sound like Lillian's boots, it might be Michelle, but the gait lacked... confidence? There was a long pause as the soft footfalls stopped before he finally heard a quiet knock at the door. 

"Come in," he ventured, tensing in his half-reclined position as the handle turned. 

A small, blond goddess peaked into the room. 

"Hailey!" 

"Your afternoon's entertainment has arrived," she smiled at him, taking a theatrical bow. She came in and removed a heavy looking backpack from her shoulders. Rectangular outlines bulged against the sides from within. 

"It's good to see you," Chris enthused. "I knew the girls were up to something, but this is a wonderful surprise. Are those books in there?" 

"Yup, lots of books and I'm your demanding tutor. Scooch over." 

She set the bag at the end of the bed by his feet and promptly jumped up as well, swinging a bronzed thigh over to straddle him. 

The lust in her blue eyes should have alerted him but Chris was surprised to find her soft lips planted firmly on his own. He really hadn't expected to be kissed, let alone so thoroughly but couldn't find it within himself to object. 

She teased and tugged a reaction from him as the rest of her bombshell body settled down on top of him. Their tongues slid tentatively against each other as his hands came to rest around her waist, rubbing slowly up her flank through the thin, clingy fabric of her shirt. Firm, large breasts moulded exquisitely into his chest as she pressed down into him, her passion rising. He felt her whole-body shiver and tense. Her hips twitched. A beautiful little gasp escaped their kiss, her eyelids scrunching tightly closed. 

His nose was filled with her rich arousal as she opened her eyes and began trailing her kisses down towards his ear. She rested, panting, breathing deeply of his spicy, pheromone-laden, scent. 

Chris closed his eyes, too. She was so warm and soft and small under his hands, clinging to him. His cock rapidly caught up to the situation, swelling and twitching between their bodies. 

Finally, Hailey let go of him and pushed up onto her palms. She searched his handsome features seriously, for what, even she didn't know. 

"I thought we were taking things slowly?" he asked, smiling devilishly up into her halo of short, golden hair. 

Somehow his carefree response seemed to soothe her because she slid down the bed a little and lay back down, her cheek above his heart. 

"I missed you, Chris. I missed your touch, your voice, your smell..." she whispered. "That night at the club I was so excited to be yours, I could have screamed. I just wanted you to take me home with you, even if it was just to talk or cuddle or something. Then Lillian broke your heart and those men attacked you and... I didn't really see you again. You went off to catch the people responsible and got hurt. I thought... It's silly but I thought you might have forgotten about me or didn't care, especially when I heard about Lillian's pregnancy." 

The dragon rumbled underneath her, his arms wrapping her up possessively. 

"I didn't forget, my beautiful little werebison," his voice was deep and rich, vibration rolling into her body through their contact. "I'm sorry, in hindsight it seems heartless but none of it was on purpose. Lillian's pregnancy came out of nowhere and is causing quite a stir. On top of that, I was busy helping Michelle. Regardless, we are here now, and I think you can feel that I want you very much." 

"I know. It's stupid, but it's just the way I felt. Insecurities, ya' know?" 

"I do," he leaned up kissed the tip of her adorable nose as she wriggled tighter into his embrace. 

"Hmm, it does feel like you want me an awful lot," Hailey teased, the heat and solidity of his erection obvious against her tummy. 

"Don't you start with that, too," he groaned playfully. "I get innuendo thrown at me from every direction these days. Aren't you supposed to be helping me study or something?" 

Hailey opened her mouth to reply but paused mid-breath, her happy expression turning quickly to mortification. She practically vaulted into the air and off the bed, one arm pressed firmly across her chest. 

"Hailey?" Chris was left wondering as she turned away and began fossicking desperately in one of her backpack's top compartments. 

She didn't reply, and it was like she was trying to block his view as she pulled something out and angrily re-zipped the backpack. Chris thought he caught a flash of deep purple, possibly fabric of some kind clutched in her hands as she rushed around the end of the bed and disappeared into the adjoining bathroom. 

"What did I say?" he wondered aloud, part bemused, part concerned. 

When she returned, she played off the entire episode. Chris let it go as she grabbed a heavy chemistry text book and settled down beside him to read and discuss. 

*** 

Lillian came to him that evening. His extended family had gathered in his room for dinner and they'd barely finished eating before she arrived and kicked everyone out. He could see the predator lurking in her dark eyes as she stripped unceremoniously and pounced on him. 

Her take on the doctor's orders of him 'avoiding exertion' was simply that she had to be on top, doing all the work. She silenced his objections with a huge mouthful of creamy tit-flesh as she quivered, flexed, and bounced on his steel-hard manhood. All the while she cooed throaty praises and moaned loudly as she quickly peaked. Robbed of his attention for almost a week, the pregnant, buxom vampire was beside herself with lust. She easily drew out his own release, milked him for all he was worth, and continued her avaricious fucking without respite. 

What little rest he got that night was interrupted every few hours when she insistently mounted him and rode to the heights of passion again and again. 

Scant hours before dawn, Chris became fed up. He rolled on top of her, pinning her to the hospital bed. He forced her thick, soft thighs wide and wrangled himself into position against her play struggling. He entered her steaming, messy, pussy savagely, thrusting deep as she screeched her approval. Lillian soon found herself with her heels over his shoulders as he pistoned forcefully down into her lush body with his glorious cock, sounding her limit. He bit her perfect skin and mauled jiggling flesh wherever he could reach it, being far more unrestrained than he ever was with his other lovers. His roughness and passion set off her vampiric desires, drawing her quickly to a shuddering, squealing orgasm. Covered in sweat and breathing like a steam train, Chris finally succumbed. One last time, his voluminous ejaculation spewed from the fat, throbbing spear buried deep within his keening vampire mate. 

They collapsed together in a tangle of stained bedding and sweaty limbs, her inhuman lust satiated at last. She took a small sip of his blood before catching a few rare hours of sleep in her dragon's loving embrace. 

In the morning, Dr. Chang arrived with Emilia Mayer in tow. She was escorted by two members of Compound security. Lillian had showered and dressed by then, but Chris had to put his semi-ruined gown back on to be decent. Still, there was an awkward moment when the four entered. The place must have reeked of sex and Chris' hurried efforts to make the bedding more presentable were laughable. 

Dr. Chang gave Lillian, fresh out of the shower, a disapproving glare but it was like water off a greased duck's back. 

"Hello, Chris, I'm Emilia Mayer," the researcher boldly introduced herself and sat on the edge of his bed, unfazed by the mess. She watched his eyes narrow in assessment and anger, but he took her offered hand and shook it tersely. "Firstly, I'd like to apologise for this situation. I needed to assure my survival and you were the most valuable hostage I could think of, nothing personal." 

"Huh, I think I'll reserve my right to take it personally," Chris grunted. "You should have just surrendered and cooperated, it would have earned you a lot of good will." 

"That is essentially what I am doing, is it not? I've given Agent Hamund and Lady Narlakis all I know about the workings of Riker Pharmaceutical and accepted their conditions for my continued existence. I just couldn't take the chance that in the heat of the moment I would be killed out of hand. My work, especially involving your biology is too important." 

"What work?" he asked warily. 

He'd heard the woman had been experimenting on the captured Beings. That made him angry from a moral standpoint and a little violated on a personal level. However, having never met her before this, her face and presence didn't illicit a strong reaction and it was difficult to mask his curiosity. 

"Oh, all sorts of things really. I was barely scratching the surface when I was so rudely interrupted by your pet vampire." She watched him scowl and chided herself. "Sorry, I jest. I was mostly focusing on your amazing regenerative and disease fighting capabilities. I could make you a very rich man if you allowed me to continue my work, not to mention all the good such cures would do if available to the broader population. All I would need is a few samples every week." 

The two body guards shuffled nervously in the pause that followed. They were tasked with keeping the human out of trouble but what could they really do if the dragon or Lillian for that matter decided to take offence against the stubborn old woman. 

"That sounds almost exactly like every other offer I receive on Maginet," Chris finally replied. "A scale or two, a vial of saliva, a few ounces of blood. I'll make you rich. It couldn't possibly do any harm." 

He sighed, watching the older woman as she opened a leather satchel and began assembling a shiny but rather archaic looking syringe gun. 

"Now my species is on the verge of extinction and the first human who begins to understand my abilities wants exactly the same thing." 

"I didn't peg you as one to indulge in melodrama," Emilia said matter-of-factly as she loaded a vial of clear fluid into the gun and squirted a little from the tip. "I don't do any of this for my personal gain, I want to advance science, our understanding of the universe. I wouldn't expect someone so young to understand that drive but if you think curing cancer, AIDS, or unlocking the secrets of telomere degradation aren't worthy enough rewards for a little discomfort once or twice a week, then you're more callous than I imagined." 

His stunned look let her know that her hook had struck. She took advantage of his silence and adeptly inserted her needle into his shoulder. He winced only slightly as the plunger pumped the antidote into his muscle for slow release. 

"That's quite enough out of you for one day," Lillian came to Chris' defence. "Next you'll be telling us how the Nazi's experiments in the Second World War were justified." 

Emilia ignored the vampire, instead packing away her equipment. Only Chris noticed her weathered hands tremble slightly and a firmness settle in the wrinkles at the corners of her mouth. 

"I'll think about it," the words came from him almost unbidden. 

"Thank you." Emilia's surprised smile stripped decades from her appearance as she met the young man's eyes for a long moment. 

"You're done. Out!" Lillian hissed, perched like a menacing hawk on the other side of his bed. She pointed threateningly at the door before rounding on the woman's two minders. "One of you two knuckleheads needs to get down to Eddard's Apothecary right now for some pheromone cancellation potion. The boy's mother will know what you need." 

The two burly shifters glanced nervously at each other and began bustling their charge away from the advancing vampire as she chased them from the room. 

"Consider it an order." 

Once everyone had filed out, Lillian stalked toward her sheepish young lover and leaned over him until their noses almost touched. It was quite distracting for Chris, lying half upright in the bed. Her heavy breasts hung between them and with several buttons of her crisp white shirt open, there was a lot of kissable pale skin and intriguing geometry on display. 

He yelped, released from her jiggling spell as she struck like a coiled snake, grabbing his flaccid cock through his gown. 

"I am not sharing with that geriatric psycho," she almost purred, her husky voice full of both menace and promised delights. He was hasty to nod agreement as she held him captive, like a cat with her prey. "Good." 

She kissed him then, her lips soft but insistent. His breath hitched out raggedly in relief, his mind struggling to deal with her swinging mood but much happier with the current direction. The grip on his member melted instantly from threat to skilled caress. 

In stark contrast to the previous night, she was gentle and loving as they made out. Her hands in his hair, her shallow breath, the way she nibbled her lower lip so sexily as they finally untangled; it all had him hooked on this Amazonian goddess and hinted at a softer, more vulnerable nature. It drew out his feelings of love and protectiveness for her, his friend, the mother to be of his child. That she shared body and soul with a dark, parasitic entity was almost unfathomable in that perfect moment. Then her wicked, extra-wide and fang-filled grin split her face and she latched onto his shoulder like a hungry lamprey. 

"And they say men only want one thing," Chris winced and chuckled as she lapped and sucked at the two shallow puncture wounds. She moaned something incomprehensible back into his skin, her body shivering in appreciation. 

"Mhhhhh," Lillian purred as she finally surfaced, wiping a stray line of bright red fluid from her chin and sucking the stained finger with obvious relish. "Just remember you can have that thing whenever, however, and wherever. Now, rest and get your strength back, my studly young dragon. In ten days you'll need to answer to the vampire council for rewriting the rules on my fertility." 

"I, ah..." 

"Hush," she soothed. "Don't worry overly, they think you're some sort of golden goose only I'm the one with the eggs." 

Someone wrapped on the door. 

"Who is it?" Lillian asked. 

"It's me," Michelle answered, coming inside. Chris saw several faces peeking in curiously behind her before she shut the door. He thought Kat might have been among them. 

"Please, do come in," Lillian's sarcasm was dripping. 

"Good morning, Michelle," Chris was much cheerier. 

"I hope I'm not interrupting anything," Michelle's nose flared adorably and her eyes widened as she spotted the stain on the bed that Chris was avoiding. "I wanted to introduce a few more members of our team." 

"I suppose we were pretty much finished," Lillian admitted. 

"Give me five minutes to shower and I'll be ready," Chris nodded. "And, um... maybe you could ask a nurse for a change of sheets? Please?" 

"Of course, they have a nice foyer here and the place is abandoned, so why don't we meet out there when you're ready," Michelle smiled. "Though you two might consider that your medical bill is going to be enormous if they have to keep burning mattresses." 

Lillian punched her playfully in the arm for that.

Having availed himself of the bathroom's amenities, the toiletries, and clean clothes Annabel had packed for him, he sallied forth. His steps were initially unsteady, having been unconscious and bedridden for so long. It was hard to place a finger on what he felt, but something inside him was off, his body knew it. Still, his strength and confidence returned gradually as he walked barefoot up the hallway towards the nurse's office and reception. Annabel had supplied him with a comfortable pair of baggy sweatpants as well as several t-shirts and pairs of underwear. He was glad he didn't have to face Michelle and her posse in his hospital gown. 

Nurse Ruth tutted in mild disapproval as he passed her station. He managed to escape with a dazzling smile, a light caress of her forearm, and reassurances that he would be taking it easy and sitting in plain view of her post. 

The clinic lobby was surprisingly nice. It didn't have that characteristic hospital starkness and disinfectant smell which spoke of unthinkable cycles of ill people inhabiting the same space. The colours were warm and dark, the armchairs and other furniture looked like they belonged in someone's well-appointed living room. The lighting was soft, not blaring fluorescents. There was art on the walls and a rock garden of succulents on the large coffee table in the centre. All in all, a very welcoming feel. 

Everyone rose when he entered, making him feel self-conscious. Michelle seemed to sense this and guided him to meet the two late arrivals to their little team, Samantha Patel and Pamela Smith. 

"It's good to meet you two," Chris shook their hands in turn, smiling and trying to seem friendly. "Lisa and Kat had to help save my ass on the second day of the job, so the more the merrier." 

"It wasn't like that, Chris," Lisa chimed in. "It was very brave of you to go undercover in that situation. Getting you out is the least we could have done. Those poor people they'd been snatching for weeks are all at home now because of you." 

"Brave-stupid," Kat added cheekily. 

"That's my signature move, don't you know?" he shot back, grinning. 

"Okay, everyone find a comfortable perch and relax," Michelle said as she shepherded Chris to a plush recliner and took the adjacent chair for herself. "Samantha, Pamela, why don't you tell Chris a little about your backgrounds. Then we can get the debrief signed off and you can ask the dragon all the questions you've been bottling up." 

"Me first," Samantha started in with enthusiasm. "Everyone can call me Sam by the way. I was born in the States, but my Mom and Dad met in Mumbai when he was stationed at the Consulate there. I grew up in several places around the world, we moved a lot with my father's work. I ended up following in his footsteps and joined the Air Force, became a pilot, and flew transport helicopters for half a decade. I met my husband there and we quit and moved to Oregon. I joined the Portland Police Bureau and began working my way up the ranks and eventually became a homicide detective. We had my little angel, Amy. Sadly, my husband died in a construction accident only a few years ago. Now, four years later, I'm approached with a mysterious offer to move to Denver for a 'life changing,' exciting position with stupid pay. Here I am." 

Chris nodded along with her story. Her mother's Indian heritage was obvious in her lovely brown skin and thick dark hair. He couldn't help frowning as her story took a terrible turn with the death of her husband. It must have been difficult for her and her daughter. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
"I'm sorry to hear about your husband, Sam. How old is Amy?" 

"Thank you. She's seven, almost eight," Sam beamed. 

"It must be tough for her to move at that age. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help, I'm a dragon after all. My fiancé Annabel is great with kids." 

Sam was a little taken aback at the forward offer. At first her protective instinct told her to be wary, but the large young man seemed completely genuine in his offer. 

"I'm sorry," Chris watched her brow furrow and the other women in the room exchange nervous glances. "I shouldn't have..." 

"No. No, it's fine. I appreciate the offer, I was just taken aback. I'm sure after the Revelation she would love to know a real-life dragon. She's such an inquisitive little soul." 

"Okay. How about you, Pamela?" he asked. 

The athletic blond fixed her green eyes on him appraisingly and he noticed for the first time just how many freckles she had. It was quite striking, her obviously pale completion showed signs that she loved the sunshine. Her body language told him she wasn't comfortable. He wondered what he'd done wrong. 

"Joined the Coast Guard out of high school, became a gunnery sniper, shot the engines out of drug boats for a few years," she sighed and looked around the room as if to ask if it was necessary to continue. She'd been sceptical about taking this job from the beginning. This oversized kid in front of her was supposed to be some sort of magical badass, a dragon. Something was fishy. "A while back I moved to LA and got into the LAPD Tactical Response Unit. I've been pulling triggers ever since. I mostly took this job as an excuse to get out of a long-term relationship that wasn't going anywhere, plus the pay." 

"Wow, um, okay," Chris was lost for words. 

Michelle rolled her eyes at him as Pamela opened her mouth to continue. The woman was known to have an attitude. 

"I'm starting to wonder if I should have stayed in LA. Since when was there an all-woman anything in the police or armed forces? We're like some sort of Michelle's Angels bullshit." 

"Michelle's Angels! Ha, I like that one," Lisa laughed. 

"Hmm...I think we could use that," Michelle mused teasingly. 

"I'm not joking," Pamela obviously didn't appreciate their sense of humour. 

"Look, Pamela, I understand this situation must seem quite unusual but there is a reason for it," Michelle spoke, her tone placating but leaving no doubt that she was in charge. "You only officially joined the team a few days ago so you're catching up. You are just barely dipping your toes into the world of magic. I require you to have some mental flexibility. If you can't, or wont, I have no use for you. You've read the dossiers I gave you?" 

"Skimmed, mostly," the slightly chagrined woman admitted. "It just seems so unbelievable." 

"It's true," Lisa assured her. "You wouldn't believe some of the things I've seen in the last week." 

"Chris, would you mind giving us a little demonstration?" Michelle asked. "Nothing too taxing though. I wouldn't want to upset Dr. Chang." 

"To say nothing of my health. Okay, let me think," he said wryly. Last time he'd done a half transformation but that was a demanding process. Perhaps a little phasing? That was pretty easy. "Okay, you've probably heard or read a little something about the Ether, my dragon element?" 

He received nods around the room and Kat spoke up. 

"I don't understand it at all though. It's another dimension that this one is linked to somehow?" 

"Sort of," he cocked his head in acknowledgement. "In truth I'm not sure anyone really understands it but I'm learning as much as I can. Anyway, I'm told I have unprecedented control of magic relating to the Ether. Kat would you like to assist me with the demonstration?" 

She looked a little wary at first but gathered her courage as he stood and held out his big hand to her. A marine like her wasn't going to pussy out on a little magic, heck, it might be fun. 

"I need to take your hand," he warned, feeling a little shiver run up her arm as he took a gentle but solid grip on her wrist. She gripped him back in return, her body tensed like a coiled spring, ready to explode. "Relax. And don't freak out." 

He let his awareness wash over her, surround her. Her lips were just parting in an astonished little gasp, gooseflesh beginning to form on her skin as they vanished. 

"What the..." Pamela jumped up from her seat and brushed a hand through the empty space. "Invisibility?!" 

"Well, sort of," Michelle looked to Lisa and Sam to see how they were doing. "I suspect he's using one of his more powerful abilities, phasing, a roundabout sort of teleportation. They could just be sitting in the Ether right there laughing at us though." 

"Teleportation? That's so cool," Lisa seemed to be taking it quite well. 

"Sam?" Michelle asked. The experienced detective had settled back into her chair and was rubbing her temples thoughtfully, eyes closed. 

"I just realised what a headache this job is going to be. Our world is going to be a very different place when this gets out." 

"Yes. Yes, it is," Michelle smiled a little sadly. Finally someone got it, saw the bigger picture rather than the shock value of the magic itself. Her instincts had been correct, Sam would make an excellent second in command at the Denver office.  

"But how is that possible?" Pamela rounded on Michelle. "Where did he take her? Is he going to bring her back?" 

"I don't know how it's possible and I have no idea where he took her," Michelle said calmly. "You have to give Chris some slack. Think of him as a fresh recruit. He's unique and magically powerful but inexperienced. He's also incredibly valuable. It's our job to train, protect, and use his talents to complete our mission. If he decides to bring Kat back anytime soon that is." 

"What else can he do? And if he's so powerful, why does he need our protection?" Sam asked. 

"That's fair," Michelle nodded. "He needs our protection because he's exposing himself to danger to help us. As well as providing magical support when we need it, the higher-ups have earmarked him to be some sort of a public figure when this all comes out. They think, and I agree, that people will need to see and have chances to interact positively with Beings if we're going to integrate their hidden world with ours. Chris has the potential to fill this role well. He's young, attractive, mild mannered, and most importantly still connected with his humanity. So many of the old, powerful Beings I've met have lost that entirely." 

"I see, he will almost certainly be the target of more violence then." 

"Not only that," Lisa added. "I've been doing some reading now that we have access to their Maginet. I also got a chance to talk to one of his mates, Claire. He's incredibly valuable to his species and Beings as a whole. It would be a tragedy if something happened to him." 

"Did I hear you correctly? You said ONE of his mates?" Sam cocked an eyebrow. 

"Yes," Lisa said, a little colour rising in her cheeks. "He has five, six if you count the sprite." 

"Good lord, how does he..." 

"Pheromones, I treated you both with a potion to resist them this morning," Michelle said. "It's all in the briefing package but there's a lot to read through." 

"The little skin swab," Pamela scowled. "It wasn't a DNA sample after all." 

"Indeed, and you'll need to dose yourselves every day like I do if you don't want to embarrass yourselves with him," Michelle smirked. "Unless you think you're completely immune to his charm that is. Perhaps you can see now why I was told to assemble an all-female team to work closely with him. His interaction with humans needs to be carefully managed. The type of men who usually possess our skill sets often have egos to go with them." 

"That's the truth," Pamela admitted. 

A little crackle was their only warning as Chris pulled a flustered Kat back into the room through the Ether. In his other hand he gripped a large cup holder full of beefy takeaway cups. Kat's bounty was a white card box. 

"That was fucking crazy!" Kat enthused to wide eyed stares. 

"I had a hankering for hot chocolate and donuts," Chris shrugged. "There's enough for everyone." 

They ended up talking for over an hour. Chris got filled in on all the work that went on to get the kidnapped Beings back to their families. Michelle gave them a report on what actions were being taken after the incident and expressed her frustration trying to get Patrick Riker arrested. The women were full of questions about magic, dragons, and all sorts of other Being related subjects. He didn't even come close to being able to answer all of them, but it felt good to talk and for once feel a little knowledgeable. 

Eventually Dr. Chang came to collect him, it was time to start dialysis. Before he was led away, Michelle took him aside and made a cryptic comment about coming to see him later for a more private visit. 

His days abed took on a loose schedule which ended up being far more bearable than he'd imagined. In the morning, he was injected with the antidote by Dr. Mayer herself. Early in the afternoon, he would be hooked back up to the dialysis machine for several hours, sometimes the rest of the day. 

One of Michelle's Angels, as they now jokingly referred to themselves, was usually hanging around to keep an eye on him. He protested his need for constant supervision, but Michelle said it was good practice for them. 

In truth, he was never really left alone at all. Petra and or Claire usually spent the morning with him and Hailey kept him company in the afternoon. Susan and Annabel would drop by when they could, but their schedules were full with work and school. Everyone came to the clinic in the evenings to have a picnic dinner. Those were his favourite times, lifting a lot of the frustration of inactivity. He didn't get to see much of Michelle or Lillian outside of dinner, they tended to work late or all night. 

One of his broodmates always stayed overnight with him. It wasn't always about the sex, it felt just so right to have a loved one to wrap his arms around and sleep beside. 

*** 

"Hailey?" 

"Yeah?" 

Tucked up against his side, she looked up from the research paper she was reading on her tablet. He couldn't help adoring her as she wriggled closer underneath his needle-and-tube-rigged arm. 

"I was wondering... what's something I could do with my magic to help humanity on a large scale?" 

"I'm not sure," she frowned, scrunching her nose. "What brought this on?" 

"It was something Dr. Mayer said to me the other day. She seemed to think I should allow her to research my biology because it could help so many people." 

"I've got no doubt the right research could help a lot of people." She sat up and looked down at him, her short blond hair cutely messy. "It would also probably make a few people very rich to license or sell dragon-based cures. You also must consider how exactly they would plan to mass produce these cures. There's undoubtedly a magical aspect to your healing abilities which couldn't be replicated in the lab." 

"I hadn't thought of it like that," he admitted. 

"Providing magical healthcare to the masses is actually a pretty poor use of your potential in my opinion." 

"Oh, really?" he teased. "I suppose you have a better idea." 

"Don't I always?" 

"So far, yes, my beautiful little aspiring astronaut. I'm ever in awe of your intelligence, it's very attractive you know." 

"You're such a tease, Chris," she batted at his chest. "When we have sex, I want you to tell me that over and over." 

"Actually, I was thinking that for our first time I could phase us up to low orbit, we could sneak aboard and fuck in the ISS." 

She gaped down at him, trying several times to find words. 

"C... could you?" 

"Don't know," he smiled. "Worth a try?" 

"Oh, God yes!" her eyes closed as a little shiver ran over her skin just at the thought of it. 

"Damn, you're one serious little space freak." 

"You have no idea," she leaned back and hugged herself in excitement. "Yet." 

She was wearing a snug, light grey sweater-dress and the movement did wonderful things to push her breasts toward him. That was why he noticed the spreading patches of darker fabric around the centre of each of her beautiful sweater-puppies. 

His mind reached back to a time where Lillian had been tormenting him about Hailey's crush and claiming that were-bovine women lactated almost constantly. He hadn't put too much stock in that at the time, being more worried that Annabel would take Lillian's teasing to heart. Should he say anything now? 

Something of his dilemma must have shown on his face. 

"What?" she leaned closer. "Was that too much? I thought..." 

"No, Hailey, I like the idea, I really do... It's just... Umm... Are your boobs leaking?" 

She looked down and saw too late that her dirty little secret was out. She didn't say a word but felt herself turn scarlet in mortified embarrassment. In a sudden scrabble of bedding, she made an attempt to flee but he sat up quickly and caught her wrist. 

"What's wrong? Hailey, don't run away," he softened his grip and asked gently. "Look at me, please." 

Very slowly she raised her eyes to his. There were the beginnings of tears glistening at the corners of her striking blues. 

"It's nothing to be ashamed about," he assured, gingerly placing his needle-stuck arm comfortingly on her shoulder. She had an arm across her chest to cover the wet spots, he recognised the position and it finally clicked for him. "This is why you've been going to the bathroom so much?" 

"Yes," she admitted ashamedly. 

"Why didn't you just tell me? Lillian mentioned something about this a while ago, but I didn't think about it too much. Dragons have plenty of weird and cool biological quirks. I don't mind that you lactate, it's kind of hot actually." 

"No, it's not. People tease me sometimes and mutter things about my Mom and I when we're around town. My nickname at school was Daisey." 

"Who?" Chris' anger was sudden and intense, dragon anger. "I'll kick their asses." 

She looked taken-aback, her eyes searching, hoping for acceptance. As if a dam inside her burst, she flung her arms up around his neck and clung to him, burying her face against his neck. Her words came out in a flood. 

"I was scared you would think it was gross. Chris, I'm sorry. I knew I couldn't hide it forever, but the moment never seemed right and the longer I left off telling you the harder it got. Please say you don't think it's gross? I have to wear absorbent bra cups all the time and it gets so much worse when I'm around you. It's like, even just your smell turns on the faucet." 

He rubbed her back comfortingly as she babbled but had to start chuckling when he felt the warm wetness spreading from their contact, seeping through his own thin hospital gown. 

"What?" She sat back into his lap and looked up at him a little reproachfully. 

"It's not gross. I like you, milk and all... It's just that you're getting it on me." 

She looked down between their bodies at the rough circles of damp fabric. 

"Oh my God, I'm going to die of embarrassment," she squeaked. 

"For such a smart girl, you're really hung up on this, huh? Hailey, you're beautiful, and from what I've seen so far your breasts are world class." 

"No, you don't have to live with them..." 

"Hush," he kissed her softly. She seemed reluctant at first but soon her soft lips were meeting him firmly, her pink little tongue slipping tentatively into his mouth. 

Chris' good hand was stroking up and down her slim torso, closer and closer to its target. When it finally slid up to gently cup her left breast, she let out a tiny gasp, stilling their kiss. He tenderly supported it, hefting slightly from underneath, running his thumb lovingly across the fabric shielding her upper slope. 

Her eyes were locked onto his, her little body quivering as he reached up and slid the grey fabric off her shoulder. Her bronzed skin looked sumptuous against the exposed top of a lacy but substantial, dark green bra cup. He paused, seeking permission, a finger gently running back and forth over the wide, lightly padded support strap. She worried her bottom lip for several seconds, considering or perhaps gathering courage. She closed her eyes and nodded, pent up breath escaping her in a shuddered rush. 

Even as he slipped his finger under the strap and eased it down to the side, her hand came up to do the same on her right shoulder. She made a small shrugging motion and suddenly, most of her breasts were bared to him. 

He stared, once again astounded by the female form. She was so large and perfectly rounded, heavy. Unleashed, they were weighted down slightly, but this only served to accentuate her beautifully upturned, cone-like nipples. So pink and soft and glistening with moisture. He hadn't come across that sort of shape before, like her areola and nipple were merged into a puffy, sackable little teat. 

He badly wished his other hand was fit for duty, but he made do with one, pushing her brassiere and sweater further down her body. Her lower slopes were marvellously full, spreading out slightly across her chest, a little wider than her torso. They were the sort of tits you would expect on someone with Lillian's more full-bodied figure, not the slight young blond exposed and vulnerable before him. 

"See? Beautiful," he whispered. His finger traced all the way down the side of her right breast, looping under the swell, crossing the slight gap at her sternum to repeat the worshiping caress on its twin. 

Under her butt, Hailey could feel his member grow and throb, hot and insistent. Her womanhood was responding too, moistening as a small fire began to kindle low in her belly. Her hands played across her lower tummy and across her thighs nervously. She opened her eyes slowly, her skin puckering under his gentle touch. He had such a look of undisguised adoration on his face that she had to smile. 

He exploringly cupped and hefted her left tit, squeezing a little, like someone trying to find that one ripe avocado at the market. He was surprised how firm and engorged she felt, almost hard. He squeezed again, just to make sure. 

She gasped as a little squirt of white fluid shot from her nipple, spattering his gown. He looked down at his chest, chuckled and shot her a roguish grin. She watched his eyes twinkle mischievously, holding her gaze as he very slowly raised his mouth toward her dribbling left nipple. 

"Fuck," her breath hitched as his lips softly enveloped her puffy little cone. Their eyes never parted as he flicked his tongue around her sensitive teat and began applying gentle suction. 

She was unprepared for the way her body responded to the warm, tugging sensation. As if on cue, an overwhelming tingling began in both her breasts, bordering on being painful. It had never been this powerful before. Then, as the dragon continued to suckle, the dam burst and her milk let down. She sighed happy relief, almost like if she really needed to pee and could now finally relax and let it flow. 

Chris was in heaven. What started as a warm little trickle of creamy milk became a veritable torrent. She was delicious, sweeter and richer than fresh cow's milk. His dragon instinct told him her milk was chock full of nutrients and more than a little magic of her own. He gulped quickly as her flow increased. She looked down at him, a silly little smile on her face as he guzzled and sucked greedily at her nipple. Her fingers tangled into his short hair and she pulled him closer. 

A warm splash across his cheek and spreading dampness on his right shoulder made him splutter and turn his head. Sure enough, her neglected breast was firing off volleys of wasted milk in complaint. They were quickly soaking him, the streams surprisingly powerful and rhythmic. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
"Sorry," Hailey shrugged down at him and moved a hand to cover her overflowing breast. "They do that sometimes when I'm really full." 

"Don't apologise, you... unnngaarrlllgg," Chris tried to come up for air and speak but got blasted across the nose and mouth by the tit he'd just abandoned. He ended up laughing, the arm hooked up to the dialysis machine aching slightly from the jostling. He quickly clamped her left nipple firmly between his thumb and forefinger, stemming the flow. 

She whimpered, her body tensing, hips fidgeting. It was like her nipple had a direct line to her little runaway steam train of a pussy and any signal sent just shovelled more coal into the fire box. Stemming her milk like that was unreal, she almost screamed out in a combination of pleasure, frustration, and dull pain. 

"Sorry," he spluttered, loosening his grip a little and brushing milk off his nose. "Am I hurting you?" 

"No... Not really," she panted. "I'm just really sensitive and it's intense. It's sort of sore when I get backed up like that... unnngg... It's okay for now." 

"Okay, well I was going to say that you shouldn't apologise. It's delicious and I only wish I had two mouths, so I could get all of it." 

"Really?" 

"Hailey Sibon, I could literally spend all afternoon suckling the most delightful milk I've ever tasted from your perfect boobs," he promised solemnly. 

"Oh... um... if you really like it that much I suppose you could keep pinching this one until you've drained the other one a bit," she suggested softly, revealing her dripping and still softly squirting right breast. "They're sort of sympathetic like that. I usually use two pumps at the same time when I'm at home." 

"I'd love to," he grinned. 

"Okay, lie back then. It will be more comfortable for both of us." 

She guided him back onto the bed. As she leaned in above him, her breasts hanging full and heavy in his face, Chris shook his head in astonishment. 

"How could you not think this was hot?" 

She smiled happily and silenced him with her fresh nipple. He growled in satisfaction, and she moaned relief and pleasure as her sumptuous milk began to flow freely again. 

"What was your idea?" he asked an hour later as they lay snuggled together, dozing. 

"What idea?" 

"You hinted that you had a better idea for a way I could use my powers to help people." 

"Oh... that," she giggled. "I'm all out of ideas. Sucked dry, you might say." 

"Seriously?" he chuckled, squeezing her against his good side. 

"I warn you, it's nerdy." 

"Go on." 

"Okay, think with me. What do you think are the biggest problems facing the world today, aside from the Revelation of course?" she yawned, coming more awake. "Think about human problems." 

It was ever like Hailey to have him consider and puzzle out an answer, rather than just giving it to him. It's what made her such an excellent tutor. 

"Pollution, overpopulation, dwindling resources, climate change, wealth disparity?" 

"Good," she purred. "All good answers. I would have added the ocean, especially acidification, but I guess that's part of pollution. They all help paint the broader picture. Can you think of one thing which could go some way to helping all of these issues?" 

Chris thought about it, determined to impress her but came up blank. 

"I'm not sure. They all seem like quite complicated and somewhat separate issues. Short of me magically enforcing some sort of global socialist regime, I don't see how you would get everyone to agree on the correct course of action, let alone buckle down and make the sacrifices needed to combat the problems. It's not in human nature and I would make a terrible dictator." 

"Ha, you're right," she laughed. "You're too soft hearted to be a global dictator. Sadly, humans don't seem to care about the writing on the wall, Beings too. No... I'm talking about cheap, abundant energy." 

"Magical energy?" he asked, confused. 

"No, conventional. Electrical mostly, but ready to be converted for use as needed." 

"I thought we had enough to meet our demands, at least in the developed world. I can't remember any power outages or talk about a scarcity. Solar and renewables are finally becoming cheaper than fossil fuel power, aren't they?" 

"Yes, they are and that's admirable but you're missing my point." 

"Which is?" 

"That if we could help jump an order of magnitude in electricity production and have it cheap to produce, it could be spent in ways that could benefit everyone globally." 

"Explain, please?" 

"Okay, there are a lot of things which we know how to do but don't because they're too energy expensive. Proper recycling and pulling carbon dioxide out of the ocean to make carbon-neutral jet fuel and other products are just a few that come to mind. We also know that access to electricity and the corresponding quality of life improvements it brings lowers birth rates. If electricity was cheap and very abundant, you could do really cool things like desalinate ocean water in Africa and try to stop the rampant desertification there. There are so many things that could potentially be possible, not to mention that it could be a huge advance in aerospace technology." 

"There it is," Chris chuckled. 

"I'm serious," she protested. "A lot of what's holding us back in space is how to generate electricity." 

"Okay, how though?" 

"Fusion... We could try advanced fission but there are already people doing clever work on that." 

"Like, the sun fusion?" he asked incredulously. "Haven't all sorts of scientists been trying to make that work for the last half century too?" 

"Yes, and they have made it work," she said a little testily. "They just can't keep it working for more than a few hundred milliseconds or harvest any power." 

"What am I supposed to do about that?" he laughed. 

"Well, I was thinking about how you said everything has a presence in the Ether. Tell me, Chris, have you heard of a muon?"

Chris was chafing at the bit to be released late one afternoon. It was the sixth day of his incarceration, as he'd come to joke about it. Hailey had recently left to pick up some groceries for her mother and he was alone. He was on and off his tablet, unsettled by the news Michelle had brought him after lunch. 

The uproar and publicity around what the public perceived as a terrible act of violence at a popular if quirky nightclub had died down substantially after a week. However, people hadn't forgotten. They also hadn't forgotten the supposed hero of the hour, Chris Baryst. In his absence, people were wondering what had happened and if he was okay. Those who remembered him in his home town, Laramie, were quick to speak up that they knew him and surprisingly persistent in trying to track him down. 

Annabel had been fending off inquiries about him, including a few from dogged reporters who latched onto that connection. She'd ignored those during the first few hectic days where everything was up in the air. Once he'd been brought home and hospitalised, she used that as an excuse as to why he couldn't be contacted and wasn't available for interview. Michelle had jumped on that bandwagon, no doubt spinning a tale of bravery, a quiet hero recovering from grievous wounds in a private hospital. 

Michelle informed him that there was starting to be a little too much speculation for her liking. He was to have an exclusive interview with a 'reasonably tame' local reporter when he was fit to leave hospital. He would be on his own too, except perhaps an invisible vampire. No one was going to save him if he blundered and said the wrong thing though. He was nervous, and it put a huge dampener on his excitement to be cleared for release, possibly as early as tomorrow. 

A kerfuffle outside broke into his worrying. He thought he recognised the gravely old voice. 

"... know he's in there because I can smell him, the smarmy little lizard." 

Chris got up and opened the door, peering into the hallway. 

"Sir, I don't know you," Kat's voice was raised, her accent echoing up to him from the waiting room. "You step the fuck back or I swear to God I will drop you, old man or not." 

"I'd like to see you try, missy," snarled the old werecat. "I drove all the way here to see my boy and I hate driving, makes me cranky. You'd best be out of my way before I take you over my knee for a spanking, you ain't too old." 

Chris grinned wide and started quickly down the corridor to avert disaster. He was half tempted to wait a while and see how the situation unfolded, it might be funny. Jethry wasn't what he used to be, and Chris didn't want to chance him getting hurt. He burst into the reception to the comic sight of the two about to square off. By the lecherous grin on Jethry's face, Chris realised he was enjoying himself and probably did intend to give Kat the promised spanking if he could manage it. 

"Kat," he warned humorously, "back away from the dirty old man." 

"Chris!" Jethry exclaimed happily as they took the few steps between them and embraced. "Jesus boy, if you was a steer you'd be fit for slaughter. Look at the size of you." 

"Thanks, I guess. It's great to see you, Jethry. Here, meet Kat, she ahh... I work with her." 

"A pleasure to meet you, Miss," the werecat fixed his speech into something more proper, yet still mocking. "Jethry Dale at your service, for all your spanking needs of course." 

Chris rolled his eyes at her over Jethry's shoulder and shrugged slightly in apology. 

"I saw that," Jethry poked him firmly in the gut making Chris grunt and then laugh. "You ain't too old for a spanking either, though you might be a little too big." 

"Sorry Kat, he's the dirtiest old man you'll probably ever meet, but I love him," Chris wrapped his arm around Jethry shoulder. 

"Just keep him away from my ass or I'll whoop his, even if it is scrawny and old." 

"You're not porking this one too, are ya?" Jethry complained as Chris turned them toward his room, still in clear earshot of Kat. 

"No! Jesus, you're terrible," Chris' ears were burning now. 

"Good, 'cos I like 'em feisty." 

Chris led him away before he could be embarrassed further. Back in his room, they found seats and just looked at each other for a moment. 

"How are you, boy?" the older man asked seriously, all trace of mischief gone. 

"I'm ready to get out of here," Chris sighed. "Susan told you what happened?" 

"Yep, can't say I understand it all. Some sort of poison?" 

"Basically, yeah. The scientist who'd been experimenting on... and I suppose caring for those poor folks, was smart enough to realise the hammer was going to drop on them if they captured me. She's basically been holding me hostage, feeding me the antidote every day for the last week." 

The werecat grunted in disgust, stroking his bristly chin thoughtfully. 

"Saw your picture on the news, that was a hoot. All sorts of folks been dropping by unannounced to ask about ya." 

"Yeah, sorry about that. It's only going to get worse though, they want me to be some sort of ambassador for the Revelation. I'm working with the agency they're setting up to try keep people honest when this all comes out. It feels good to do stuff like getting those kidnapped Beings back." 

"That's good, son. Someone like you will make a big difference, maybe show some of the rest of us that working with the humans isn't so bad. I've heard... mutterings, Beings leaving the hubs, spreading out and going back to the wilderness if they can manage. I don't know if they're trying to hide away and live how they please or if they're just running away from the places where shit will hit the fan hardest." 

"We'll see. It could definitely all blow up in our faces if we aren't careful," Chris admitted. "It doesn't bode well if there are already humans trying to experiment on us. Imagine if word of that got around." 

"Just do your best, for you and your girls," Jethry clapped a hand companionably on his shoulder. "You've got little ones to think about, too. If you need to just run for a while and get them safe, there's no shame in that." 

"I know. Any other advice?" 

"Naw, not really. Just be true to each other and don't take yourself too seriously." 

"Yeah, I feel like you might have taken a bit too much of your own advice on that last part," Chris laughed. 

"Maybe," Jethry admitted. They sat silently for a while. It wasn't awkward, they'd spent that much time working together over the years. "Damn, I should have picked us up a pack of beer or something." 

"Don't worry about it. Folks will be arriving for dinner soon. Will you stay? How's the farm?" 

"I could stay. Funny you should ask about the farm," Jethry grinned. "I got a load of hay from the Johnsons, but the boys didn't want to stack it nice in the back of the barn. It's sitting outside under a tarpaulin, but it won't be long until it's snowed on." 

"I'll see what I can do," Chris nodded. "I've gotten pretty good at lifting things with this house I'm helping to build. I'd take you around there right now but the doctor here is fierce, he'd probably lock me up an extra day or two if I tried to slip away." 

"It can't be that bad, I smell all sorts of tail in here. Milk, too." 

Chris blushed. 

"Ha! You've found yourself a little heifer then, I thought I smelled one," he shook his head in mock regret. "Teach a boy to milk a cow, aye?" 

"Jealous?" Chris teased back. 

"Of course," he replied gruffly. "Good for you, boy. Plenty of worse things could happen to the world than you sowing your seed far and wide." 

"It's not like th-" Chris protested. 

"I know it's not. I'm just saying. You're different, Chris, I can feel it. I always had this instinct about you, call it a cat sense. The hairs on my scruff pick up whenever you're around. It ain't a bad thing, just a sort of 'careful with this one.' When I heard you knocked up that sweet piece of vampire... well, I just wanted to see for myself you were okay. People take note of that sort of thing. You're in unknown territory so be careful." 

"Thanks. I really mean it, Jethry." 

"Ah, pishaw," his old friend dismissed. "You'll do fine." 

*** 

Two days later, when his urine and blood tests finally satisfied Dr. Chang, Chris was released. 

The first thing he did was head down to the warehouse to visit the construction site. He was like a giddy child waiting to see what was inside his present. Hailey had hinted the day before that the progress was impressive. 

She wasn't wrong. The bucket loader and pile of crushed rock were gone completely. There was also a half-used pallet of bagged plaster mix by the stairwell. He took the stairs three at a time, almost barrelling into Stephen at the bottom who was muttering and scratching his head over the complex installation manual for the security door system. There were brackets, packets of bolts, rivets, and all sorts of pre-built wiring scattered around him. 

"Chris! Just who I wanted to see," the big werebison bellowed, wrapping him in a huge hug. Chris was a bit surprised at the contact and didn't commit to the embrace. "Don't A-frame me, dude. We hug like men in this family." 

"Okay," Chris laughed, infected by his friend's obvious good mood. They embraced more firmly for a few seconds. It was sort of nice. 

"I'm glad you're back on your feet," Stephen said as he abandoned his frustrating job and beckoned Chris to follow him inside. They had to step around the two thick slabs of steel, doors yet to be installed, that were resting up against the wall. "I've been holding off on a few of the spells until you got back, we're running a bit low on juice." 

Chris' eyebrows rose in astonishment as they entered the foyer, even more so when he saw the kitchen and living room. Gone were the dark, bare walls, the dusty floors, and the featureless spaces. Surfaces which were to stay bare rock were polished and sealed, corners rounded down, and cracks filled. Ceilings and walls were mostly plastered where they required it. The kitchen floor had been tiled beautifully and the huge living-room was littered with thick rolls of underlay, ready to be installed. Light fittings hung from Stephen's high, fake rafters. They were bare wood, elegantly tapered toward the centre of the room to give the illusion of a peaked roof above them. Chris had to admit that touch helped make it seem like a real house. He was astounded they'd gotten all this done in little over a week. 

"Come on, you haven't even seen your room yet," Stephen ran his hand along the bare rock walls, pausing briefly at each of the doorways to utility rooms or storage closets. With a craftsman's eye, he evaluated the rock for flaws, cracks, and moisture. "The terrible trio have been over the stonework with a fine-toothed comb. We've sucked the last of the ground moisture out with a spell and sealed it." 

"This is amazing. You've done the plumbing, too?" Chris wondered as he looked into the main bathroom, seeing it tiled and multiple shower heads protruding from the wall and ceiling. The entire far third of the room was a sunken area with steps leading down into it, a hot pool fit for a small harem. 

"Some," the werebison said. "There's still a lot to be done in the en-suites." 

"Woah," Chris whispered when they finally got to his own room. The room itself wasn't anything special, a modest to large bedroom. The ceiling had been plastered and lights installed but the floor and walls were still bare and there was no furniture. 

He knew that the plans had included an en-suite and a small walk-in wardrobe but what seized his attention as soon as he got in the room was the inlaid rock carving of three dragons guarding a yawning, low, silver archway. Whether entwined in battle or lust he wasn't sure, but the craftsmanship was astonishing. 

He moved closer to run his hand over the incredibly intricate artwork of troughs and ridges. A bubbling joyous laugh rose in his throat as he realised there were tiny flecks of silver, red, and purple impregnated in the dark ochre stone. Taking a step back, he examined the work again. A red and silver dragon on either side of the archway, the purple twined around them from behind the portal, his wings partially covering them. To be honest he looked a bit handsy, a paw possessively on each female's hip. Their three graceful necks met at the top of the low archway, reaching upward together in a silent roar of triumph. It was stunning. 

"Holy shit," Chris turned to Stephen, lost for words. 

"I know, the boys stayed late for an entire week. They didn't let me in here until two days ago. Trust me, you haven't seen the half of it." 

Chris reached forward curiously and touched the shimmering substance inside the arch. It parted, revealing a pitch-black corridor. It was low and narrow, but Chris was more interested in the hair-thin silver strands running through his fingers. It shimmered and bent easily, marvellously cool and incredibly attuned to his magical senses. There was an enchantment there. He brought his hand nearer, pulling the strands into the light for examination. He could barely see them, even with his excellent eyesight, but there were tiny chain links there. 

"Mithril," he whispered in awe. "How did..." 

"Don't look at me. Just go in there," Stephen smiled and produced a long, thin candle from the back pocket of his cargo pants. "Take this." 

Chris concentrated for a moment with the wick between his finger and thumb. It was much harder for him to use fire magic, but he'd gotten a lot better under Arvil and Immi's tutelage. This was a relatively simple feat and a flame soon sprang into life, greedy for wax. 

Holding the candle before him, he reverently parted the mithril screen and ducked to enter the passage way. Stephen gave him a few moments and quietly followed behind. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
He had to stoop for perhaps four metres, passing intricately carved filigree, some of which looked to be painted. He touched it in passing, feeling the cool, ridged stone under his fingertips. The candle only provided soft, weak illumination of what lay beyond, but he still sank slowly to his knees in wonder. 

The flickering light licked the domed walls and ceiling, revealing an immense, incredibly detailed mural covering every surface. He didn't notice that his knees weren't protesting the hard stone, cushioned as they were by several layers of woven reed mat. His eyes raced around the beautiful, flowing scenes which traversed the inside of the igloo-like structure. 

Rugged, snow covered peaks, rich woodlands full of wildlife and game. A stream which wound around this section of the room on a journey of transformation. Trickle to rush to torrent to majestic foothill meandering. It ended as a great river surrounded by lush farmland, flowing gently into a white-capped turquoise sea. That wasn't even close to half of it. It was all so masterfully created and lifelike. He shuffled trancelike to the sloping wall, reaching to touch the velveted antler of a proud buck. The goblins had worked their magic with stone there too, the scene was really a painted, shallow sculpture. 

Stephan stepped quietly to the side of the entrance, still a little hunched over near the sloping walls. He found the little button disguised as the gleaming, dark eye of a raccoon gorging himself on berries. 

At the peak of the dome, a field of stars and the crescent moon twinkled into existence, shedding soft light across the scene. Tiny light globes, inlaid into the rock itself. 

Chris turned and looked back, seeing that in the mural, they had entered through a yawning cave mouth. On the other side of the entrance to the plump raccoon, a small village of huts prospered. Little green-grey figures went about their business, mothers chasing children, men with picks over their shoulders looking like they were headed toward the cave for a day's work. 

Tears rose unbidden in his eyes as the rest of the peculiar room finally drew his attention. An open fireplace was skillfully set in the wall to look like a campfire in an icy tundra scene. Two little wooden cubby holes disguised as log-ends could house a few necessities. The huge, rounded futon-style mattress in the centre of the space underneath the twinkling night sky, spoke to him of comfortable, lazy days spent resting. There was even a huge mound of fluffy bedding piled up against the far wall. The strange little room radiated safety and tranquillity to his dragon. Finally, he understood its purpose, a stunning nesting chamber for his two pregnant mates. 

"Beautiful, isn't it," Stephan affirmed. "I couldn't believe my eyes when they showed me. Apparently one of their wives was bragging to someone back home in Europe about her husband who worked for 'that dragon' and how he brought home filled crystals every night. Word got to their queen somehow and she got a hold of the trio and ordered them to make you a gift befitting a dragon." 

"It's..." 

"I know what you mean. Goblin magic, their artwork and engineering surpass even the dwarves in some instances. They've even thought to put a hidden compartment in the floor under the bed, for your hoard apparently." 

"They've thought of everything!" Chris laughed, wiping a little moisture from his eyes. 

"Indeed they have. The other raccoon's eye turns the sun on for a bit more light and the fireplace piggybacks into the exhaust system. We've done a tricky bit of enchanting, so it shouldn't get sooty. You're used to hauling heavy things down here, so wood shouldn't be a problem if you want to light it," the older man smiled proudly. "Oh, and they sent back to the homeland for that mithril lace with specific instructions. It will try to strangle anyone who forces entry or has dishonourable intentions apparently. Wouldn't want to test it personally, wickedly strong stuff." 

"This is fantastic," Chris shook his head in wonder. "Where are the beautiful little bastards? I'm not sure if I should keep it a surprise or run screaming to Petra and Claire right now." 

"Up to you. Personally, I would go for the surprise reveal, let them experience the same wonder you just did. The boys are probably waiting outside to see what you think of it." 

Chris swept his eyes around the room a final time before ducking back into low corridor. Sure enough, the three goblin brothers were waiting but what disturbed Chris was that they'd all taken a knee and bowed their heads in obvious reverence. 

"Our Queen, Glea, sends her best wishes to you and your mates," Yurt spoke in his strong accent. Most surprising was that a whole sentence from the mohawked little man didn't contain a single curse word. 

"Come here you little punks!" Chris held his arms wide and charged, sweeping them into a hug as they scrambled up to get away. He squeezed them into a wriggling, yelping ball of goblin until the curses started flowing again. "Thank you so much. I don't know what I can do to repay your kindness." 

"Oi! Fuck'n' letting us down would be a start ya oversized skink," Belthelas wheezed. 

"E's broken me damn ribs, he has," Gruff chorused. 

"I mean it guys, it's perfect," Chris relented, releasing the goblins but ruffling Yurt's spiky hair affectionately. "If there's ever something I can do for you in return, I'll do my best to help. Also, please thank your queen for my mates and I." 

"Yeah, well, every dragon needs a good grotto," Belthelas scuffed the floor with his boot and continued. "Figured you was too much a berk to know that so we'd fix it ourselves, seeing as ya been letting us nick off home with them crystals." 

"Well, thank you. It's amazing craftsmanship." 

"S'only magic." 

"Well, it means a lot to me," Chris looked back at the carved entrance, conveying so much more meaning now that he knew the interior and its purpose. "Why don't you show me the rest of what you've been up, then I'll have to organize some sort of bonus for you miscreants." 

"Right you are, Chief," they chorused back at him. 

*** 

The dragon and his brood went out for dinner and drinks that evening to celebrate his recovery. His mates looked stunning, dressed and made up for a night of fun. Chris whispered his appreciation to each of them throughout the night when he got a chance. 

Michelle was there, orbiting the edge of their little solar system as always. Kat and Pamela lurked a little further out, eyes open for trouble. Michelle had a sternness to the set of her face which told him she was worrying about something work related. He wondered if it had something to do with the private conversation she'd hinted at but so far avoided. He resolved to ask her tomorrow and went back to watching approvingly as Hailey was gradually integrated into their group. 

They were back at The Cauldron, it was a quiet weeknight and Rufus had given them his booth again. The vampire made an embarrassing show of proclaiming them the saviours of the entire establishment to the hushed onlookers. Afterwards, some of the patrons came and introduced themselves, thanking all of them for acting so bravely during the crisis. Chris felt like a fake, accepting praise for something he thought was at least partially his own fault. 

The music this evening was much more relaxed, featuring a lot of slower classics from the sixties and seventies. The dancefloor beckoned and Claire invited him to join her. Neither of them really knew how you were supposed to move to such music so they ended up simply swaying in a close embrace for a few songs. As he returned his mate to their group, Reyla made a surprise entry. 

It was clear who in the room was a Being as heads turned and nodded subdued acknowledgement to the stunning, dark skinned woman who glided through them. She made it look effortless, so poised, haughty, and graceful. She wore an almost skin-tight grey gown with practiced ease, long legs peeking from deep slits as she floated in on tall white heels. 

Chris hadn't seen her human guise before. Her skin was slightly browner, eyes less slanted and cheekbones less pronounced. Her long, sensitive ears were shrunk down to size and her figure was fuller. She still had that slightly alien grace about her and her white hair and grey eyes were striking and unnervingly, the same shade as her dress and shoes. Perhaps she could pass as a human, but she would never look normal. 

She made a beeline toward their party, two bodyguards of her own tagging along behind. 

"Good evening, Lady Narlakis," Chris smiled at her politely. 

"Yes, I'm sure it is," the elf swept her eyes over his slightly nervous brood as they stood to greet her, wondering how on earth or below, one male could... Even for a dragon it was getting excessive. Of course, it all made sense now, but her theory still shocked her to the core. "Please Chris, call me Reyla. Could I trouble you for a dance?" 

Chris didn't know what to say, eyeing the beautiful elf suspiciously. His eyes were automatically drawn to her narrow waist and rounded hips. He wanted to say yes, but knew she was up to something. 

"Of course, you can," Susan saved her son from appearing rude, appearing at his side and nudging him forward. 

"Sorry," Chris offered Reyla his hand and led her apprehensively toward the few other couples who were up and dancing. "I was just a little surprised to see you. Do you ah... come here often?" 

"Every now and then," she replied vaguely. 

There was an awkward pause when they finally faced each other. Chris felt his hands hovering, unsure where on her body to place them. Over the elf's shoulder, he could see Lillian laughing with Rufus about his discomfort. Reyla seemed to have no such hesitation, reaching up to wrap her arms around his neck, pulling their bodies close. His hands fell to her shapely hips as she boldly twined her fingers into his blond hair and began a gentle swaying of her lithe body. 

Chris relaxed, letting himself listen and move to the music with her. Her piercing grey eyes never left him, spearing deep into his soul. She was mumbling something under her breath, her lips moving ever so slightly. Too late, he felt the magic she'd been gathering so stealthily snap out and grip them both in an iron-hard blackness. 

<em>"Tell me you know!"</em> her voice echoed strangely in the darkness, all sounds of the club, of music absent. She tasted hot, like a runaway temper with a glowing interior of fear and uncertainty. 

<em>"What? Reyla what's going on?"</em> He tried letting go of her, but his body was unresponsive, still moving gently to a rhythm he could no longer hear. He could sense her blocking him somehow, engaging him mind-to-mind in a way that left him nigh powerless against her. His body moved to the tug of her will, but his awareness was trapped and isolated, alone in a dark, silent place. It made him want to scream in anger. 

<em>"Tell me it's all been some prank. Please, dragon, tell me you know something. You have a plan?"</em> 

<em>"I... Let me go! I don't know what you're talking about. This is wrong, get out of my head!"</em> 

<em>"I can't, it's too important. Show me the memories of your encounter with that strange presence."</em> 

Chris felt his mind move to follow her command, traveling back to that afternoon nap that had added another mystery to his life. His anger rose. She was inside him. He struggled mightily, battering blindly at the darkness surrounding him and roaring his impotent rage. 

<em>"Don't struggle, it will only delay what must be done,"</em> she spoke. <em>"I do not relish this task, but I must experience what you felt, and we must do it quietly. I have felt the whisperings of the Eye of Ivinos passing over my city for days now. House Lefayd is watching us. I must know if my hunch is correct."</em> 

<em>"House Lefayd?"</em> The name sounded familiar somehow, in a bad way. 

<em>"Yes, the same house implicated in your parent's deaths. Now, shut up and show me those memories. I am not trying to harm you but it's important! If the Eye is here, this is the only way I can guarantee our privacy."</em> 

<em>"If I do, will you explain yourself and let me go?"</em> he asked angrily. 

<em>"Yes."</em> 

<em>"Fine, but I am furious you would do this to me, Reyla. I could take you any number of places in the blink of an eye for a private conversation, but you decide to use this dark magic on me for what, convenience?"</em> 

<em>"For safety,"</em> she hissed in his head. <em>"You know nothing of the dangers you face or how I have sacrificed to shield you, you ungrateful little whelp. My own sister calls me a dragon-collared bitch behind my back and my standing amongst my fellow rulers is nigh ruined by your undermining, intentional or not!"</em> 

That shut him up. How much of it was true, he didn't know, but Reyla had done right by him so far. Perhaps he should trust her now, if she thought it was so vital. He allowed the memories to come to him and relaxed, focusing on reliving them rather than fighting her influence. 

He remembered the presence's probing touches as he first slipped into the Ether. He'd been exhausted that day after multiple feats of magic. It had felt so good to slip into the refreshing stream of Ether, become surrounded and supported, nourished. Then it had come, softly at first, just a shiver up his spine. He hadn't known anything was truly wrong until that mighty thing grasped him, encircled him, and read him like a book. It was nothing like what Reyla did to him now, this was a twisted sharing of thoughts. That had been an exposition of everything he was, down to the atomic level, a knowing that left his sense of self tattered and strewn about like the toys in a toddler's room. 

It was horrible to re-live, even in memory. To feel so helpless and insignificant in the face of such power, to know your life, your dreams meant nothing to a creature such as that. 

Reyla recoiled, panting hard, sweat beading on her brow and upper lip. A shiver of dread ran up her spine as she recovered, it was a wonder the young dragon's mind hadn't melted into a gibbering mess. She released her spell and watched him slowly regain his awareness and control of his body. He stiffened, eyes narrowing. His handsome lips began to pull apart, about to protest. 

<em>"Stay silent,"</em> she warned in his head, still connected by her fingers twined against his scalp and his hands on her hips. <em>"It is as I feared, you've been touched by one of the Old Gods, a Devine or one of their masters, a benevolent one I dearly hope. Worse, you cannot tell me why they are toying with us once again."</em> 

<em>"The Old... What?"</em> he thought back tersely. 

<em>"I will explain, just keep up the pretence of dancing,"</em> she thought, running her hands gently through his hair and smiling warmly up at him. <em>"To think, I hold one such as you in my arms right now. I don't know if I should be terrified or jubilant. Terrified, I think."</em> 

<em>"Reyla, explain. Please!"</em> he begged. 

<em>"I have been puzzling your remarkably strong magic and unusual powers for some time now, Chris. At first I was jaded, thinking your abilities an oddity, a balancing of the universe. If dragons were so rare, it seemed right that a powerful new male might emerge and begin to set the scales straight. Then you apparently stumbled into a nest of treachery by accident and we were forced to concede this Revelation. Too much coincidence!"</em> 

<em>"Yes, but what does that have to do with some ancient gods? Why have I heard so little of them before?"</em> 

<em>"I'm getting to that. You grew beyond a simple dragon with your full transformation, though I didn't see it then. Still, my feeling of unease only increased. It was then, I think, that my white elf cousins began taking a true interest in you. I began researching your abilities quietly, especially your seemingly undrainable well of magic. Did you know that there was an unexplained magical spike recorded around the approximate time of your conception? There are also obscure references to individuals who might have shared your powers throughout the ages but nothing concrete, at least that I have access to. When the agents of House Lefayd began showing up in my territory I knew I was onto something with my subtle investigation. I've even begun receiving all sorts of invitations to share knowledge about your unusual circumstances. Nothing more came of it and things were beginning to settle down these last months. I admit, I got distracted trying to keep my territory from falling apart. Then you knocked up my vampire."</em> 

<em>"She's not yours,"</em> Chris growled back<em>.</em> 

<em>"Yes, yes, keep her,"</em> Reyla brushed his protest aside. <em>"This afternoon I was sitting in my library, thinking over your account of the memories you just gave me when the answer came to me. That presence could have been a Devine. Our legends say that long ago, this planet was a battleground, fought over as part of some endless war against dark forces. They began modifying the existing inhabitants with magic, importing new ones from other worlds to fight."</em> 

<em>"I've heard a little of the story, Lillian tried to scare Annabel with it once. What are they though? Are they truly gods?"</em> 

<em>"No one knows. There are no accounts of ever seeing one of those old gods and no one from that time is still living. Still, their powers were so incomprehensible to us that we worshiped them, chose sides and fought for them. When you said your entity had seemed so powerful that you were almost nothing to it, a fly or an irksome gnat, it clicked. So, I decided I had to relive the experience through your eyes to make sure. Your description did not do it justice. I know of no Being on this earth who could have done that to you, not I or anyone else. Therefore, I fear something has stirred those incredibly powerful entities to take interest in our world again, in you."</em> 

<em>"This doesn't make any sense. I'll admit that whatever it was that invaded my mind may as well have been a god but what are they?"</em> Chris asked silently but paused, a frown creasing his brow. <em>"Oh no, it did show me images of my conception, some sort of ritual... it didn't make much sense at the time."</em> 

<em>"You see!"</em> Reyla's excited thoughts spilled into him. <em>"It's exactly as I pieced it together. The problem is that nobody truly knows anything about them, if they ever did. They came to us and war followed them across the void. We called their enemy demons, but that word has been so bastardised by human culture that we cannot trust the description. We do know that after years of bloodshed, our side, led by the elves, constructed a huge barrier to cut off the world from the rifts that allowed the warring gods to travel as they pleased. We were left here to live with the primitive humans of the time and the abandoned servants of the dark gods. Thousands of years later, we are the languishing remnants."</em> 

<em>"That's it?!"</em> 

<em>"I have done well to make that connection,"</em> her haughty tone came through clearly enough in mind to mind contact. "<em>I think it is our best explanation to your vast power and ability to breed with a vampire. You must have a seed of their creative magic inside you... and you've been planting it in any fertile soil you can find."</em> 

<em>"That's crazy, there has to be more information. You can't just drop that on me and leave it at that!"</em> 

<em>"So little lore survived from those early years, almost forgotten legend is all I have to go on. I'm sorry, dragon. I don't think Lefayd has made the same connection to you yet, but we need to prepare for when they do. They are already moving to insert their influence into your life. Now that you have made a child with Lillian, there is little I can do to stop them. It's too much of an oddity to block them from investigating a vampire pregnancy. If they suspect the source of your power as I do, they would stop at nothing to have you for their own. I laugh to think how they must regret agreeing to sign you over to work with the humans. It must have seemed like such a humiliating punishment at the time but now it prevents them from manipulating the Synod to give you over to them."</em>

--------------------------------------------
<em>"They would do that? Why do they care so much?"</em> 

Reyla cocked a perfect white eyebrow at him in surprise. Did he truly not see it? 

<em>"Dragon, you are possibly the most promising magical resource I have seen for centuries. Anyone who harnessed your power would have a huge economic, political, and even military advantage should things turn that way. Your efforts with your mates at selling energy crystals has already made an enormous impact on the local economy, my territory is once again exporting high-magic products as it hasn't in several hundred years. With Lillian, you have released a new flood of speculation regarding the power of your children. As your ruling lady, I've already received several outlandish offers for stud fees."</em> 

<em>"Oh, okay,"</em> he blushed. <em>"What about this Eye... of Ivinos?"</em> 

<em>"It is a most advanced scrying artefact and one of House Lefayd's greatest weapons. It can allow the users to see and freely track anywhere without the specific targeting required in most scrying spells. It also creates only a very subtle ripple to detect but can see through most simple scrying blocks. There are unconfirmed reports that it can also be used to listen in, which is why we speak through mind touch."</em> 

<em>"That sounds very nefarious, useful though. I wish you hadn't taken such a firm hand with your magic though, just... I don't know. Trust me, Reyla."</em> 

<em>"It is difficult for me,"</em> she admitted, a genuine smile revealing perfect teeth. <em>"I apologise for bullying my way in, I am... old habits are hard to break but I will endeavour to work on it."</em> 

<em>"Good... And they've been targeting me for the last week?"</em> Chris chuckled mentally, thinking back to what they must have witnessed during his time in hospital. Nothing too incriminating, if it shipped with an X rating. 

<em>"Yes, almost as soon as word spread of Lillian's pregnancy. It must cost Lefayd dearly to divert the eye from their other interests, I doubt they'll keep it up for much longer unless you perform some other impossibility. Be cautious, they are snakes. It was Lefayd who killed your father, that much is almost common knowledge, but they claim your father killed one of their own without proof of wrongdoing. I'm working on a way to shrug off their vision but it's... Oh, Lillian's coming."</em> 

Chris glanced over his shoulder, his beautiful vampire was indeed homing in on them. 

<em>"Chris. Say nothing of this to anyone yet. I... I know I am... prickly and my temper gets the better of me sometimes."</em> 

<em>"Most times,"</em> Chris couldn't help himself. 

<em>"Perhaps. What I am trying to say that I want you to trust me, to be your friend. You are a troublesome young creature to have in my territory, but you are important, and I would miss you if something terrible happened. I will not see you harmed or hindered while you choose to bless my realm with your magic."</em> 

Chris was trying to formulate a reply when Lillian arrived. 

"Well, well, well," Lillian put a firm hand on his shoulder and sneered down at the disguised elf. "Aren't we nice and cozy over here? I'm afraid you can't claim him all evening, Reyla. You see there's this exclusive club I joined recently, excellent benefits, but we're very protective of our club president here." 

"That's fine. Thank you for the dance, Chris, it was illuminating." 

To his surprise, Reyla gave him a cheeky wink, a hip bump, and a little smile as their bodies separated. 

"Ah, thanks. We should talk sometime about how I might help with that situation?" 

"Yes, perhaps," she scowled at him and flicked her eyes upward in an attempt to warn him off any further talk. Honestly, did he think that after what she'd just told him and the lengths she'd gone to, a meeting between the two of them would be unmonitored? So young. Still, he was offering help, which could prove invaluable if she could gather the courage to harness him. 

She watched as Lillian, in a very flattering black dress, led him back toward their little club. They all greeted him with such open love and adoration on their faces. He radiated it right back at them, soaking them in waves of magic and affection. What must it be like to be part of that? 

"What was that all about?" Lillian asked. "You were just staring at each other for almost four songs." 

Chris shook his head and took a sip of the beer Annabel had ordered for him to try. 

"Why can't I just come here and relax one time without something crazy happening?" 

*** 

Light from the bathroom spilled into the dark bedroom and across his supine body. He lay on the bed, pondering all Reyla had said and what it meant. He was naked, his huge body exposed and partly illuminated. It felt good to relax but in the back of his mind lurked a niggly question. Were there dozens of pale elves watching him right now as he stared up at the ceiling? 

Another bout of hushed giggling reached his ears. They were up to something in there. His cock twitched at the thought, eager to go investigate. The two had retreated to the bathroom some time ago, forbidding him entry. 

They came to him in white. It was like a fantasy he'd never known come true. It was conceived, imagined, and fulfilled in a pounding heartbeat as they ran hand in hand to pounce onto the bed. Faces lightly made up, white teeth flashing behind happy smiles, and hair flowing freely behind, they came. Annabel wore a veil and the thought of marrying his beautiful mate set his blood pulsing to where it was about to be needed most. 

Immi surged ahead with an excited shriek, reaching him first with a flap of her blue wings. Her chest heaving as she knelt at his side, eying his thickening manhood reverently. 

"I've been good..." her eyes sparkled pleadingly as her little fingers played with a new lacy, white collar around her neck. "Please, Master?" 

Chris was silenced, his eyes darting back and forth between the sprite and his beautiful Annabel. Where had the snowy stockings come from? Let alone the matching garters of white mesh and lace. There was something incredible about the way the little belts sat on the slimmest part of their tummies. Thin straps connected the decorated lacy bands at the top of their stocking, the thickest, lushest section of their supple thighs. The white looked so good against their contrasting blue and pale skin. The little collars at their throats were an incredible finishing touch, it spoke of ownership and submission. 

"Speechless?" Annabel teased as she crawled slowly up across the bed, her little, bare nipples tingling, tightening in excitement. She took position to the side of her small blue lover, stroking a calming hand down the quivering sprite princess's spine. They turned their heads to each other as if by some unspoken cue and shared a soft, cock-hardening kiss. 

"Aren't you supposed to wear panties with a getup like that?" Chris wondered, noting Annabel's tuft of soft brown pubic hair, framed perfectly by the exquisite bridal lingerie. She wore an extra ribbon above her garter that Immi lacked, it was bowed perfectly over her belly button and Bartholomew was prancing proudly around it. 

"They get in the way," Immi's practicality could not be denied. She wasn't wearing any either and her puffy little clam was visibly glistening as she squirmed. 

"Indeed, they do, my Immianthe," Chris chuckled, reaching to touch her masterfully crafted miniature stockings. "I love the veil, Annabel. What did I do to deserve this treat?" 

"Thank you, babe. It suits the theme, doesn't it?" 

"Yes, you look stunning. I wish you didn't want to wait until spring to marry." 

"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but we're married in heart at least," she smiled and tugged worriedly at the delicate veil perched in her flowing chestnut tresses. "To answer your question though, Lillian has been... well..." 

"Fang face has been teasing us, so we did something about it!" Immi crowed proudly in her high-pitched voice. 

"Immi, Bartholomew, and I have a surprise for you," Annabel pre-empted his questioning look. Smirking, she elicited a quiet gasp from him as she began teasing her nails up and down his powerful thighs, delightfully close to his thick, swelling cock. "Lillian's been going on and on about how she can handle your whole cock inside her." 

"She doesn't shut up," Immi complained. "Always boasting she's the only one who gives you the relief you need, the one you don't hold back with." 

"You know she's just teasing you, don't you, Immi?" he smiled warmly at the completely uninhibited sprite. 

"Yes..." she admitted reluctantly. "It's true though, isn't it? You can fit all the way inside her?" 

"Yes, but that doesn't..." 

"Now you can fit in Mistress too! When I'm big you'll fit in me as well!" 

"What?" Chris looked to Annabel to translate Immi's excited ranting. 

Annabel giggled down at him, moving to stroke his now throbbing cock. The huge spear of manhood rose proudly above his defined stomach, already dripping slippery pre-come. His testes looked tight and full, she couldn't wait to milk them dry with the help of their little enchantment. She teased his flared crown gently with her fingertips before releasing him and flopping backwards onto the bed with a cheeky smile. 

"Hmmm. Why don't you come find out?" She teased, raising her legs slowly open, beckoning him to her torrid, forest-capped womanhood. 

"Yes! Yes!" Immi squeaked, tugging his finger with obvious enthusiasm. 

Chris growled playfully, their teasing sparking a heady passion for his delightful mates. He threw little Immi onto Annabel's soft tummy, his massive body rising above them. 

He was going to waste no time fucking these little minxes into quivering, magic overload. 

Immi un-sprawled herself on Annabel's garter belt, gasping with excitement and tugging to release the bow around her Mistress' slim waist. It was a race against time to complete the little ceremony she'd imagined as her Master slapped his enormous cock down onto Annabel's gooey slit and ground into her. 

"Unnhh," Annabel moaned lustily as her swollen clit thrummed under his heavy member. "We wanted to...ahhh!.. to be like a dragoness for you." 

"So we altered your spell," Immi added, still tugging at the reluctant ribbon. 

Bartholomew raced beneath the sprite, all over Annabel's stomach. Elated to have participated, he left a tingling warm trail across her skin. She felt Immi triumph over the bow and release the ribbon to slither down onto the bedding. The sprite turned herself over onto her back, mimicking Annabel's position, their heads were almost side by side. Her hand snaked down to hold her swollen blue labia open, displaying her tiny, pink, glistening sex for the dragon. 

"It might be hard to wait, Master, but I neeeeeed my favourite. I used a lot of magic helping change her. I get your first climax, as much as you can give me, then you can have Mistress all night. Promise me?" 

Chris still wasn't sure exactly what the stocking clad temptresses were up to, but he had a strong suspicion. They looked so hot, so wanton, Immi laid out on Annabel's stomach, both their pussies ripe and ready for him. Immi's greedy little bargain intrigued his dragon though. Even if her eyes were bigger than her womb could pay the check for. 

"Are you sure you can handle that Immi?" he teased. He took his vein-mottled cock in hand and moved the tip upwards to Immi's comically small womanhood, nudging and teasing against her inflamed, throbbing sex. "I don't want to see any magic go to waste, you're still so small." 

"I'll use it all," Immi promised, hunching her shapely hips into him so that their sexes meshed in the promise of things to come, her tiny vagina spread over his cum-slit. "I need to grow big and strong." 

"She's been very patient and well behaved," Annabel confirmed, running a finger over the sprite's supple, flexible tummy. "You still owe her from that night at the club. She helped keep us safe." 

"Yes, I agree. Okay, I promise." 

"Ohh, thank you, Master! I promise I'll be a good girl for you and Mistress." 

Chris sighed happily as Annabel reached over Immi's stomach to help apply the sprite's sweet, almond scented juice over his massive knob. The spreading warmth of the sprite's cream ensured he would be pumping both mates full of load after load without flagging. It also increased his sensitivity. He found he couldn't hold back when Immi's potentially addictive juices were in play. Annabel loved to have his cock slathered in them before he entered her. 

Even now, he was already throbbing, eager to blow. A shot of slippery pre-come splattered Immi's stomach as she writhed against him. He reared backward and aligned himself, parting Annabel's dew-covered labia with practiced caution. 

She liked to have a few moments with just his crown inside, he was so big, so thick that she still struggled with his initial penetration. They set to a tiny, teasing, rocking motion, his enormous crown stretching her inner lips thin as he popped in and out of her. Finally, his penis throbbing and coated with their combined lubricant, she cooed her approval. Her slender hands pulled him into her, playing gently over the powerful muscles of his lower back and shapely butt. 

He sighed, slipping slowly deeper into Annabel's hot, snug channel. 

His First looked up at him with loving eyes, mouth gaping cutely as he hunched deeper and deeper with little thrusts. His enormous cock was welcomed home with thick, glistening, pussy-butter. It streaked his girth white and shiny, easing the way to her molten core. 

He was barely holding on, his sensitivity was through the roof thanks to the small blue woman who now writhed above his entombed phallus. The ecstatic sprite frigged herself joyously in anticipation and Annabel helped with larger fingers in between coos and sighs of her own. 

"God, you're so fucking big, but I love it!" Annabel shuddered suddenly, reaching a sharp climax on about two thirds of his length. 

"Come for me, Dee, my little white bride," he whispered harshly, struggling not to succumb himself. "Come all over my big cock. Milk me for Immi." 

"Yes, Mistress, please!" Immi cried, three small fingers buried in her steaming quim. 

Chris held still with herculean effort, letting her body spasm around him. He pinned her white-stocking thighs up to her sides and squeezed his eyes shut, begging not to cum yet. He pushed a little deeper and felt her quavering cervix kiss his throbbing tip. He bumped slightly deeper, testing his suspicion. 

"The ribbon..." he groaned in astonished pleasure. 

She gave way before his mighty erection, her once human body transformed into a dragoness's reproductive anatomy. They both cried out in pleasure as his apple-like head stretched her pliant cervix. Like Claire and Petra before, she now had a ring of strong, sensitive, pink tissue. 

He slipped into her dragon's womb in a rush, the final third of god-touched cock finding a stifling, tight home. 

Their eyes exchanged love and wonderment, his thick head tickling the back of her uterus. Cum was already rising, his groin tensing for a huge release. A dragon's roar of triumphant satisfaction wrenched from his lungs. How could he resist? This was Annabel, but she felt like one of his dragonesses. This was exactly where he was supposed to plant his vital seed. 

"Please, Master! You promised!" Immi wailed, watching his huge body quiver, his hips hunch. He was gathering a deliciously huge pool of magic in his loins, but her enchantment had worked too well, he'd forgotten all about her. 

His first, huge spurt of sticky cum splattered point blank into Annabel's uterine wall with astonishing force. Her whole body tensed in surprise, unsure about the unusual sensations being translated to her brain by this new part of her. Then, the sizzling magic in his spend raced up her nerves and set her body on fire. 

With a tortured groan, he pulled his massive length out of his fiancé's gripping womanhood and levered it down onto her belly. 

Annabel was left shuddering and quaking as Immi squealed, his cock firing another torrent up across their bodies. It grazed Annabel's flushed cheek, leaving a tiny white streak behind, and crashed into the wooden headboard with a loud splat. A third rope shot straight onto Immi's sculpted blue butt as they jostled into position, his rampant head searching for her tiny opening. His pungent seed now clung to her sex, stocking, and pooled onto Annabel's lacy garter and heaving tummy. 

Finally, Immi hunched herself down directly onto his dilated slit and held on for dear life as his fourth hit the bullseye. She had half a moment to relax, imagining what it would be like when he finally fucked her, before his pearly, thick jism rushed up her channel with the force of a flash flood. 

Magic, the likes of which she wouldn't have imagined before meeting him, rushed into her like a river. She didn't have a pesky cervix to get in the way, so his virile, magic-laden semen rushed from her vagina straight into her unusual womb. An orgasm crashed down on her, breaking her consciousness into a thousand shards of satisfaction. She screamed, her sharp voice going hoarse in moments as he infused her soul with his magic and love. Over and over, a never-ending barrage of his potent, treasure-like seed. 

Only her greedy, hungry instinct let her hold on, wedging his bucking cock into her reluctant, slippery slit. Her pliant tummy began to expand, her womb full and stretching, attempting to hold as much sperm as it could to spawn a healthy clutch of spritelings. She hadn't made her hundreds of thousands of eggs yet but that didn't matter. Iron devotion and determination let her hold relatively still, enduring his roaring magic and her own release as he erupted endlessly into her. 

"Master!" she whimpered reproachfully, trying not to squirm away from his gigantic, jetting penis. 

"Good girl, Immi," the dragon panted. "Hold on, just a little more now." 

He watched through pleasure-slitted eyelids as Immi's tummy swelled, his shaft and abdomen shuddering rhythmically. It wasn't all going inside the optimistic little sprite, she lay in a spreading white pool on Annabel's skin. He watched her shudder, her lithe, stocking-clad calves wrapped around the ridge of his knob to help hold on. Her blue, soon-to-be three-foot body shook as she cried out in twinned rapture and protest with each of his forceful pulses. It wasn't as satisfying as being inside a woman, and he couldn't wait to get back into Annabel's womb, but he loved Immi dearly and this was her favourite treat. 

Immi told herself that this was the time, this time she would take all of him. Even as her elastic tissues began to protest the huge bulge of her cum-swollen womb, she battled to hold on, hoping he was almost finished. Master came so much these days. Even with her growing size, she couldn't keep up. 

"This time," she whimpered softly, even as Annabel's warm hand cradled her enormous tummy and pulled her gently, insistently away from the dragon's fearsome, spitting monster. 

"I'm sorry, my little sweetness," Mistress cooed in her ear even as Master's cock spat more scalding seed across their skin. "You're going to hurt yourself." 

"Nooo," she protested weakly, rolling onto her side to cradle her swollen tummy. "I need it all." 

"Bartholomew will have the rest, we couldn't have done it without him," Annabel whispered, dragging the reluctant sprite up to lie at her side, face to face. "Thank you, Immi, I can tell he loves our little present." 

"Yes, I do," Chris leaned down to kiss them both, his unflagging cock dribbling its last across Annabel's tummy. Already the little tattoo dragon was absorbing the magic-heavy cocktail. "You are constantly keeping me on my toes, my kinky little princess. I love you." 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Hmm, I love you too, Master...aaahhhhnnnnmm," she sighed happily, her climax still ricocheting around inside her. "I can't wait until I'm bigger." 

"I look forward to it," Chris kissed his sprite again, combining with Annabel to pepper their diminutive lover with affection. 

As Immi, murmuring nonsense, began to doze off into overloaded la-la land, Chris and Annabel's kisses focused on each other. There was a passion alive in both of them, eager and excited to test their new sexual limits. With the same thought, their eyes travelled down between their bodies. His still-hard cock reached up above her belly button. 

"I need you back in me," Annabel kissed at his throat, her voice husky. "I want to feel you going off in me." 

"I thought you'd never ask," he chuckled, nibbling her chin. 

They grinned knowingly at each other, eager to resume their aborted lovemaking. He shuffled backwards to align their sexes. 

One long, slow thrust, several winded cries, and two explicatives later, he was back inside her womb enjoying something he never thought possible with her. 

Annabel, Immi and Bartholomew had done an excellent job modifying his original enchantment. She was plumbed almost exactly like a dragoness now and loved every second of his hugely deep penetration. With a Lillian-esqe smile, she locked her cervix behind his crown, eliciting an approving grunt from her sweating, pumping dragon as he adjusted his longer strokes to short, slow jabs. 

Immianthe watched from the sidelines, absently stroking her falsely pregnant belly. She collected errant strands of delicious seed from her blue, sweaty skin and relished their flavour with little moans. He was so magnificent, his tapered hips so sensual, rolling into Mistress with such lewd, fluid motion. She could see his thick, glistening root between her Mistress's thighs, it was moving her tummy with every thrust. What it must feel like! They were nearing their climax now, Mistress was yelping cutely with each slapping impact of his heavy balls to her butt. Master was breathing hard in exertion, one hand in her hair and bedraggled bridal veil, cradling her head as they kissed brokenly. The other mauled one of Mistress's perfect butt-cheeks, taking a greedy grip to fuck her with. 

"I gave her a little of my stretchiness you know," Immi spoke encouragingly, loving to watch her two lovers mate so recklessly. "See if you can fill her up like me." 

"Really?...Are you ready, Dee?" he panted happily, his fat cockhead rubbing sinfully against her spongy, dragon-like endometrium. "Do you want me to fill you right up?" 

"Fu...uck yes!...Everything you've gg...got!" she managed between the impacts, stuffed full, the wonderfully hot friction pampering her most sacred depths. 

On the verge of climax, her thighs were beginning to quiver violently. Every inch of his incredible manhood was wrapped up tight inside her, captured, ready to explode, exactly where it belonged. This was what it was to be a dragoness. 

Their mingled cry of passion woke the rest of the household. 

Far away in a high stone tower, the outpouring of magic as he claimed her womb left three elves reeling, their magical vision shorting out with white noise. 

The little inhabitants of the Ether tittered excitedly, those that were motile scampered forward, eager to catch a morsel of the mighty creature's seeping energy. Those that were rooted or plant-like basked happily in his radiance, frantically waving all sorts of fronds, leaves, and stalks to get the optimum alignment for collection. 

Annabel recovered as he gingerly tried to tug his still-hard cock back out of her clutching cervix. He had an odd, almost fearful look on his face as she cracked her eyes open and grinned lazily up at him. 

"That was just... just great," she murmured brokenly, weak and twitching from pleasure and magic. Wait, she was still coming. No, not coming, just... perfectly full and saturated with his bliss-magic. 

"Gods, Dee," he paused his retreat, his huge body still heaving from the titanic, minute-long climax he'd just endured with her. "It was like Lillian all over again, so intense." 

"You didn't bite me?" she teased, running her hands slowly up the bulging arms holding his weight off her. 

"No," he moved forward to kiss her. As he did, she became aware of a strange tightness in her abdomen. "But Immi wasn't lying, you can stretch." 

She looked down between her little breasts to see her usually flat belly bowed upward slightly. It rose up like a rounded little hill between them, a reservoir of his magic waiting to be absorbed. Bartholomew was busy having a grand mal seizure on its peak. It felt hot inside her, heavy. Her body was sluggish, reeling at the sheer quantity of magic. 

"Huh, I guess she wasn't," Annabel grunted, looking back up at him with a cute little scowl. "Just how much did you put in me?" 

"A lot," he admitted, attempting not to let a cocky grin escape the corners of his mouth. "Enough to get a vampire pregnant." 

"Good," she wrapped her arms around his neck, drawing his heavy physique back into her embrace. He settled onto her slim body, dwarfing her completely. Those smooth, strong legs of hers locked around his hips even as her dragon's cervix tightened around his enormous prick. "Giddy-up, stud. I want more." 

Those wicked stockings slid delightfully over his skin as she spurred him into action with little kicks and squeezes. He smiled, hunching his manhood deeper into her cum-filled womb, she had a dragoness's spirit too. Then again, that had been hers from the start and perhaps he'd sensed it all along. 

*** 

"Chris, wake up." 

"Huh?" he murmured sleepily, rolling away from Annabel toward the soft touch on his shoulder. "What is it, Michelle?" 

"I need to have that talk with you," she said quietly, mindful of waking the sleeping girl and the little sprite cradled to her breast. 

"Damn, what time is it?" he grumbled, rubbing his eyes and slowly sitting up in the darkness. 

"About four am, sorry. I usually leave for the gym in an hour and I didn't want to put it off any longer." 

"Okay, let me get dressed and we'll go somewhere private." 

Michelle left the room and he got up, stretching and yawning. He stood for a moment, thinking about Reyla's warning and where they might go. He turned on the little wardrobe light and dressed warmly. Snow might have already fallen where he planned to go. He'd noticed last night that during his time in the hospital, the weather had turned. The nice part of fall was over, and the wind had grown the beginnings of its winter teeth. 

When he was ready, he turned out the light and returned to the bed to kiss Annabel's warm, mussed hair. He leaned over and gave little Immi a peck where she lay curled on his fiancé's chest. The sprite gave a tired murmur and batted him away sleepily. He smiled, remembering how he'd worn them both out last night. Their tummies were still a little engorged, their bodies working hard to catalyse his magic into their own. 

Michelle was waiting for him in the kitchen, drinking a glass of water and eating a banana. 

"I don't know how you get up this early, you go to bed the latest out of any of us," Chris snatched up a banana for himself from the fruit bowl. 

"I couldn't sleep," she admitted. 

"It's been weighing on you that much? Why didn't you just talk to me?" 

"I don't know, procrastinating I guess." 

"Well let's go then," he smiled at her. "You'll feel better getting whatever it is off your chest, I promise." 

"Where are we going? Couldn't we just talk here, or in the Ether?" 

Chris thought on that a moment. He didn't know what Michelle wanted to say but with the elves spying on him, he didn't want to take any chances. He had to wonder at the irony, when he'd first arrived here it had been Reyla spying on him. Perhaps she still was. 

"There's somewhere I haven't been in a while that I want to check out. Grab a coat." 

"Okay," Michelle's interest was piqued. She went to the rack by the door and collected her lined wet-weather jacket. 

"Ready?" he asked, taking her hands in his own. 

"Go," she nodded consent, breathing out and relaxing her body. 

She barely caught a glimpse of the Ether before they were swept away into incorporeal nothingness. Time went on without them for a quarter of a second before they were reformed hundreds of miles away. Through the Ether, she caught a tiny glimpse of the landscape they were about to enter before Chris dumped them unceremoniously back in the real world. 

Michelle gasped, breathing in much colder air and looking around in concern at the rocky slopes rising steeply above them on either side. They were standing a few feet from a roaring steam on a large, flat-topped boulder. The sparse conifers she saw clinging between the boulder-strewn slopes had smatterings of white snow on their branches. 

"Damn, it's freezing," Chris stated the obvious. "I always forget what a difference altitude makes." 

"W...where are we?" Michelle's teeth gave an involuntary chatter as she hurried to get her coat on. 

"A little section of Bridger Creek, a few miles west of the Wind River Reservation. Susan took me on a trip here one summer when I was right into finding gold. I loved the place, but I never got a chance to come back." 

"Wyoming, damn. I hope it was summer," Michelle rubbed her arms, trying to warm up. 

"It was actually," he chuckled. "Here, gather up some dead wood down by that stone outcrop. We'll make a little fire." 

They worked in silence for a few minutes, scrambling up and down the creek bed to collect washed up sticks and anything that looked like it might burn. They piled it on a tiny little beach overlooking a large pool of icy water. When they had a respectable amount of wood, Chris used magic to encourage some of the dryer pieces to light. They soon had a loudly crackling little blaze, eager for more of the sappy conifer fuel. 

Michelle was grateful for the physical work and the heat of the fire. She stood warming her chilled hands for a few minutes as he watched her. 

"Michelle, come here," he said from his seat on a nearby lump of granite, his back to the outcrop. 

She shuffled reluctantly closer until he reached out and snatched her up, eliciting a cute little yelp as he sat her in his lap. 

"There, we'll both be warm in no time," he said as she fidgeted. "Now, tell me what's bothering you." 

"I... I don't know why I'm finding it so hard," she admitted, stilling her restlessness. 

It was true, his big body was giving off heat from behind whilst the fire warmed her front. Here she was, a grown woman, sitting in a nineteen-year old's lap. She found it didn't bother her nearly as much as it should. 

"This isn't like you at all," he chuckled. "It can't be that bad." 

"I think I finally realised where my loyalty truly belongs," she whispered, turning to look him right in his striking blue eyes. "With you." 

"Okay," he smiled. "Thanks. You know it's not like you've been disloyal before now, as far as I can tell." 

"No, you don't get it. Ever since we met, even under those circumstances, you've supported me. You saved my life, gave me sharp vision again, a home, friends, and you're a great partner for kicking bad-guy ass. Even with all that, until last week, my ultimate loyalty was to the agency and the country. I watched Patrick Riker weasel his way out of kidnapping and the worst kind of medical experimentation. Until then, I believed in the system and the rightness of what I was being ordered to do. You risked everything to go to that place and stop them but when it came time for my people to do their part, they put me, put justice, aside for fear of upsetting some very rich people. I suddenly realised they didn't deserve my loyalty, you did." 

Chris listened attentively, wondering at what a capable, devoted soldier the NSA had just lost. 

"Thank you, Michelle," he wrapped his arms around her in a huge hug. "I see now, this must have been difficult for someone like you to admit." 

"It was," she sniffed, a disturbing amount of emotion welling up inside of her. 

"You'll always be part of our family, whatever you want that role to be," he promised. 

"You mean..." 

"Only if you want to," he qualified, smiling down at her. "You can stay my awesome friend from the NSA as long as you like. You'll always have me and the girls to come home to if you want, or not, whatever you prefer." 

"Annabel's cooking is worth sticking around for," she nudged him playfully. 

"And only getting better," Chris agreed, giving her a final squeeze and releasing her. 

"Okay, then," Michelle collected herself. "The next part is that Lillian and I have been plotting ever since Mr. Riker fled the country. She called in some favours and had him tracked to a lovely little mansion on the island of Sardinia. In the next few days, the three of us are going over there to dish out some street justice." 

"I like it," he agreed wholeheartedly. "I can rampage and trample his house, scorch everything to the ground in true dragon fashion." 

"I'm afraid not, it would be a little too conspicuous and we are trying to fly under the radar on this one. It isn't exactly sanctioned." 

"Sardinia huh, it's too bad I haven't been there before... we'll have to take the jet, at least that will be fun." 

Michelle gave a mock sigh, his antics were infectious. 

"Maybe," she teased. "It might not be available." 

"See that it is, henchwoman," he intoned in a deepened goofy voice, raising a finger as if to accentuate his point. "Street justice is a dish best served stylishly!" 

"Okay, okay, you big dork," she laughed, getting off his warm lap and pulling him to his feet. "Now take me home in style before I freeze out here." 

"Just one second," he qualified, releasing his contained magic to flow out up and down the canyon. "Last time I was here I did pretty well in gold dust. Hailey's had me thinking over a problem and I'm positive dragon gold could be useful. I want to check if I can sense more." 

"I wish I could do that," she huddled closer to the fire and watched his face. He had his eyes closed, apparently concentrating. 

"The stream bed is filled with sparkling little flecks, pooling in calmer areas. Ahh, there's the lode, it's small but the river is breaking it down quickly," Chris commentated as his dragon sense swept up the stream, seeing the precious metal like a fleck dust on the wind. He frowned. Something tugged at his senses from behind the exposed quartz vein, something much deeper in the hillside. "Oh my, it's big. I knew I had a good feeling about this place years ago." 

"Gold?" Michelle asked enthusiastically, the warmth of the fire forgotten. 

"Yeah," he opened his eyes and sadly bottled up his magic once more. "It will have to stay there for now. It's deep in the hillside and I've got no way of getting in." 

"Couldn't you... I don't know, go full dragon and dig your way in there?" 

"Maybe, I haven't really given it much thought. It will wait, no one's going to find it in the meantime." 

"Damn, I was getting excited," Michelle complained. 

"Will you settle for a quick trip back to somewhere warm, perhaps a coffee?" 

"Absolutely." 

Lillian was waiting when they arrived back at the apartment. She efficiently herded them both down to the gym and put them through their paces. There were only two other Beings in the gym that early, so there was plenty of room for everyone. 

Whilst Michelle was no match for the speed or power of either Being, she enjoyed watching how they sparred and was picking up a few tricks of her own. It was breathtaking to see them fight. When she glanced over from her treadmill, they looked so savage and intent on ripping each other limb from limb. Even though she knew they were both resilient, she worried someone might get a fracture, or worse, a broken neck. 

When Chris went to work out on the over-engineered resistance machines, Lillian called Michelle to the mats and they practiced for a while at a human level. Whilst the NSA trained agent would be considered accomplished in hand-to-hand combat by most, having studied karate for many years, she had a lot to learn from the half-millennia old vampire. She was dripping sweat when Lillian finally went to join Chris in the showers. 

Chris was supposed to be having a day off, so he decided to see if Hailey would like to go out to breakfast. He was hooked on her enthusiasm to master the power of the sun with his magic. After some extensive reading of his own, he was finally grasping what a huge technological grail it was and what it would mean if he could help solve it. Hailey had been right too, with sufficient clean power generation, so much could be done to set things right in the world. It was an infectious idea, in a satisfying way. 

Mindful of his other responsibilities, he mentally scheduled time later in the day to help at the building site and perhaps get some initial firearm training with Kat or Lisa. He didn't imagine himself carrying a gun in the field with Michelle and her Angels, but it was always best to be competent if the need arose. It might also be fun. 

Hailey was very pleased to be asked out to breakfast. They went to the beautiful little Being-owned café Annabel had discovered but sat inside in the warmth. Once they had their heads together, muttering, scheming, and planning over their meals, they barely noticed their ever-present tail, Lisa, sipping her own hot chocolate in the corner. 

"That's why I think dragon-gold will be perfect to surround the reaction and harvest energy if we can make it work," Chris said before scooping up a cheesy mouthful of what had to be a six-egg omelette with obvious relish. "Gold is already an excellent conductor and the neutrons will knock off a ton of electrons which is basically a way to harvest all that otherwise lost energy. We could even use carbon to slow them down. Who knows what I can make dragon gold do once we start experimenting, I have such an intimate connection with it." 

"That's all well and good but first we need to see if your power over the Ether will allow you to make a viable containment field. If we can't get that working, we'll be forced to use magnetism, the conventional way. That might complicate things to the point where we are forced to give up." 

"How do we test that?" he frowned. If they had to revert to making a tokamak, they may as well wait until after the Revelation and offer magical help to one of the several fusion projects already underway around the world. 

"That part should be fairly easy," she said after a few moments to finish chewing the honey-coated, nutty house granola she'd ordered. "I think we could prove the concept using any sort of matter relatively safely. The muon capture test will be trickier... their lifespan is only 2.2 microseconds without relativistic effects." 

"Are any of these tests going to be dangerous?" he asked. "I don't want us turning into comic book mutants because we got an unexpected dose of radiation. I haven't had to test my healing abilities that way." 

"Hmm," she mused, tapping her lip thoughtfully with her spoon. "Not to begin with, I think. If we got to the stage of actually having a reactor up and running... let's just say we wouldn't want to be standing next to it until we'd had it tested for a good long a while." 

"Is it legal?" he wondered. "I can't imagine they want just anyone setting up experimental reactors in their backyard. Maybe we should find a remote place to work or approach a laboratory to help us." 

"I'm not entirely sure. It's not fission and we're not making any weapons grade material. You might be right though, laboratory equipment and a few experienced scientists on our team would really help. My boundless enthusiasm only gets us so far." 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"It's your incredible brain that's going to get us far," Chris smiled. "Perhaps I should ask Michelle if she could set something up. There must be some high-level people at NASA who have heard about the Revelation by now." 

"Don't tease me, Chris. You know that would be awesome," her eyes twinkled excitedly. 

"I'm not teasing. Let's finish up here and do some proof of concept work this morning. If it's promising, we can think about what the next step is." 

"I can't tell you how sexy it is that you're so enthusiastic about my crazy ideas," she beamed up at him and squeezed his hand fondly across the table. 

Chris returned her gesture, gathering her much smaller hands in his own. She was so adorable, so smart. The admiration in her blue eyes made his heart thump loudly, his lust quicken. Such a busty, cute, goofy little woman. Their minds on the same track, they leaned across the table to share a tender kiss. Their lips were soft and tentative, together for only a few moments until Hailey pulled back shyly. She blushed furiously and glanced around the café, mortified to see a few Beings watching avidly. 

"It's okay," he brushed her cheek with a finger and raised her chin, so their eyes met again. "I'm proud to be seen with you." 

"But..." 

"No buts. Let's get the check and go fuck with subatomic particles." 

Chris decided Jethry's farm was as good a place as any to experiment with a little magic. It killed two birds with one stone because he had promised to move a pile of hay into the barn. He knew if he didn't get it out of the way soon, it would drop off his radar. 

Lisa insisted that she come along to supervise, intent to experience the crazy bodiless sensation Kat hadn't shut up about for an entire day after that dragon-donut run. She and Hailey were left staring around in wonder and patting body parts to make sure everything was there while Chris got stuck into the heavy work straight away. 

Jethry's old truck was out so Chris assumed he was running errands in town or something. He instructed the women to make themselves at home in his and Susan's old, cold house while he finished working. They entertained themselves being warm-heartedly nosy. Hailey especially was fascinated by the room he'd grow up in, half stripped of belongings. She sat for a while on the edge of his old bed, looking at the few faded, almost childish posters hanging on the wall, a roaring dinosaur, a proud lion, a space shuttle launch. There was a shelf in one corner, full of little trinkets and oddities he'd obviously collected over the years, so carefully laid out. The bedding was fresh, but the room still smelled faintly of his human scent. It was strange, when she emerged, she felt she knew him so much better. 

With the stamina he'd gained hauling rock and the trick of dragging things into the Ether for transport, it took him just less than an hour to have the hay squared away. He was at that awkward stage of sweatiness where he didn't know whether to have a shower or not but decided against it. 

The three of them stole some extra warm clothes from the hallway closet and trudged out to the old quarry field, past cows grazing happily on the last of the tall, dry summer's grass. 

"I like this place," Hailey chirped at his side. "There's no smell of sick animals like you get on some farms." 

"Jethry really cares for his livestock," Chris explained proudly. "Calls the cows his 'girls' and everything. It's a small farm so he can devote his attention to every little detail, gets top dollar for his milk from a local cheese producer because it's so good." 

"Didn't you used to help him? What's he going to do now you're not here?" she asked. 

"I don't know," he answered honestly. "I worry about it sometimes. He needs someone to help him with the big chores and it's got to be lonely for him out here." 

They took the steep, only slightly treacherous track into the bottom of the old gravel quarry. Decades ago, someone had needed a lot of stone for road work, leaving a large pit behind. Chris thought it would be perfect for their needs, out of the way and impossible to see into if you weren't standing on the lip. They navigated a few muddy puddles at the bottom, Hailey looking around and nodding her approval. 

"Okay," she set her shoulders. "Take me into the Ether." 

"Alright," he took her hand. "Lisa, we're going to vanish for a little while, but I promise we're not going anywhere." 

"No," she started authoritatively. "I mean, could I come along please?" 

Chris cocked his head slightly to think, he couldn't see why not. He beckoned her over and extended his protection around them both. They slipped quietly into the Ether, leaving the old quarry deserted once more. 

"Stay close," he warned Lisa as he dropped their hands. She just gawked at his purple radiance for a few seconds and then scurried after them as they walked a few paces away in the dim, barren landscape. To her, it seemed like a horror realm from a video game or an alien planet, dark, desolate, vision only extending to a few dozen meters around the glowing dragon. 

"I wonder what makes all these shadow presences," Hailey mused, squatting to examine the ghostly, grey outline of a larger rock. She tentatively pushed her finger against it. It was as solid as its real world counterpart. 

"What's more of a mystery to me is how we can do this," he kneeled beside her in a ghostly puddle and ran his hand through the rock with mild resistance, like pushing his fingers through jelly. 

"How?" Hailey asked. "The Ether was hardly covered in my training." 

"So far as I can tell, it's about what you think. My magic is based on intentions. I want my hand to pass through, so it does. There's a small energy cost but nothing like maintaining the two of you here. Even that is hardly a drain." 

"Hmm... so you're manipulating a shadow of a rock, but the shadow is based exactly on the real rock, as far as we can tell," her brow wrinkled in concentration. "But a rock is made of matter, atoms like anything else. But the shadow is malleable... could it? No..." 

"What?" he asked excitedly. 

"Okay, remember our talk about electrons? What if we're dealing with quantum mechanics here? There has to be something from the Norm that has a presence of sorts here in the Ether. What if they spend a tiny fraction of time here in the Ether? Texts always talk about the probability of finding an electron in a given atom's orbital, perhaps matter has a tiny chance of being here in the Ether?" 

"That's crazy," he murmured, running his hand back through the stone experimentally. "Could it be that simple?" 

"Simple?!" she laughed. "There's nothing simple about it. And it's just a theory. As far as I'm concerned, Einstein would roll in his grave if he could hear us now. Something has the Ether presence though, it must be something at a basic level. There's no reason a rock would have a presence and its atoms would not. We're breathing Ether air atoms aren't we?" 

"How do we test it?" 

"I'm not sure. Could you please try to make an area of Ether around the rock that nothing can leave but anything is allowed to go into? A barrier or sphere of some kind?" 

"I don't know, but let's try." Chris rubbed his hands together for a moment before extending them toward the rock, closing his eyes and settling his mind. He tried to picture a perfect little globe encompassing it, nothing allowed out, everything in. He pictured his criteria down to atoms and electrons, even light. That should make it easier to test if it was working. He let his magic build a little, not sure how costly such a spell might be. 

"Is this safe?" Lisa asked from behind them at the most inopportune moment. 

"Shh," Hailey whispered. "He's concentrating." 

When his mind was settled once more, he let the gathered energy flow through his body. A flash of vivid purple arced across the small space between his hands and the rock. Chris yelped in surprise and drew back, his extremities tingling. Before them, a purple orb pulsed ominously. 

"Oh my God, it worked," Hailey murmured quietly before excitement bubbled forth. "Let's go back to the Norm and see if the effect carried over!" 

Chris just knelt in his little puddle, staring at the pulsing thing. It looked like some sort of egg about to hatch into god knows what. Every now and then something swirled or moved subtly on its perfect surface. 

It was about the size that would have fit comfortably in his hand but picking it up would have been the worst of ideas. He already knew the effect had carried over into the norm, this was his magic. He had created this, and he now shared an intimate knowledge of exactly what it was doing, intentional or otherwise. 

"We can have a quick look," he spoke, rising suddenly and pulling Hailey away from it a little more roughly than necessary. "Then we have to get away from it and turn it off." 

"It isn't safe, is it?" Lisa picked up the concern in his voice and followed them away from the orb. 

"Most definitely not." 

"We just started, what's wrong? Can't we do some tests first?" Hailey asked, a tiny hint of petulance in her voice. If they could get this working, it would be huge. "Can you move it up and down at least? Make it expand or contract?" 

"There's no time, Hailey," Chris unceremoniously dumped them back into the Norm with a quiet pop and pointed at the completely black orb hovering just above the ground. "I told the spell to let everything in and nothing out. No light, and most importantly, no air is escaping or bouncing off once it touches the surface. It's gaining pressure at a staggering rate." 

"It's a bomb," Lisa turned to him disapprovingly. "I'm revoking your license for crazy experiments, Buster." 

"Hey, we're in an old, abandoned quarry, that count's as responsibility in my books," he rebutted. 

"Fair enough," the short brunette admitted. "Let's get out of here. By the sounds of it we'd be better to stop it sooner rather than later." 

"Please, Chris," Hailey protested. "Just see if you can lift it magically or if it's stuck. It's not sinking into the ground, devouring rock, so I think you might be unconsciously holding it in place." 

"Okay but that's it, we're leaving right after that," Chris said. 

He reached out roughly with his magic, easily finding the orb even though he wasn't in the Ether. Perhaps Hailey would have felt more concern if she were connected to it, feeling hundreds of billions of molecules pass through the barrier every second. He was thankful that he wasn't feeling a drain on his magic to contain all that extra pressure but that was a concerning mystery in itself. 

The ball rose eagerly to his mental command, taking only a tiny sip of his energy. It hovered, unnervingly still, at about eye level. That answered that question, now it was time to leave. 

"Take my hand!" he commanded both women, pulling them into the Ether and quickly jumping back to the farmyard. 

"Is this far enough away," he asked Lisa, a little breathless from a combination of worry, exertion, and excitement. 

"What?How am I supposed to know?" Lisa asked incredulously as they all turned to face the direction of the looming disaster. 

"FBI training?" he asked hopefully. 

"Not for this!" she laughed. "Damn, let me think. We're half a kilometre away or thereabouts and it was inside the quarry. I think we'll be fine so long as you haven't somehow made a baby nuke." 

"Let's hope not, if it looks bad I'll pull us away," Chris squeezed their hands reassuringly and told the pulsing orb to cease existing. 

A white flash rose into the sky, followed closely by a sharp crack. A dull, deep roar followed closely behind, felt in every cavity and soft flesh in their bodies. As they recovered, brown dust and chunks of rock spewed up into the air like some miniature volcanic eruption. Even from that distance, Chris could see rocks beginning to rain down in the surrounding pasture. 

In the few second of silent awe that followed, the wind carried a startled, plaintive mooing to their ears. 

Chris was off like a lightning bolt, sprinting back toward the quarry. All thought of his ability to phase vanished, his mind consumed with horrible imaginations of their poor cows in agony, mutilated by a storm of falling boulders. Hailey and Lisa called out to him, but he didn't turn back. 

When they caught up, they found him kneeling next to a cow on her side. The beast had calmed under his gentle touch and he was dripping mouthfuls of his healing saliva into a nasty gash that ran down the side of her left rear leg. Lisa blanched at the odd sight but on closer inspection, the wound was already beginning to heal over. 

"I'm so sorry," Hailey rushed forward and hovered over his shoulder. "Will she be okay?" 

"She's fine, mostly startled and scared," he reassured her, patting the cow's flank at the same time. "It's not your fault, Hailey." 

They spent about ten minutes caring for the injured cow and checking the rest of the startled heard over for injury. It was only luck that had prevented further such incidents. Several fist sized, and larger chunks of jagged rock could be seen scattered around the field. 

"Holy shit, can all of you do crazy shit like that?" Lisa wondered as they peered cautiously over the edge of the quarry. 

"No, not even close," Hailey reassured. "Our dragon is definitely a special case. Magical explosions or fireballs, or even electricity isn't that uncommon in fights. This was technically a conventional explosion, just a lot of gas released all at once, magic only enabled it." 

"That orb was only going for what? A minute and a half? Two?" Chris' eyes were wide with awe, looking down at the shallow crater and the strewn, cracked rocks littered everywhere. "What would have happened if it had gone on for an hour?" 

"I'm just thankful you realised what was happening so quickly," Hailey careened into his side for a hug. "I shouldn't have asked you to do it and I shouldn't have made you play around with it after you knew it was dangerous. I'm really sorry, Chris, we can call this whole thing off." 

"Don't be ridiculous," he gathered her up and squeezed her tight little body as they stood on the edge of the blasted old quarry. "This was an amazing success and you've opened my eyes to something I hadn't even conceived of before. My magic can manipulate physics in deliberate, controlled ways. It's dangerous, but it's awesome. That orb had some serious potential for containing fusion plasma, Hailey, you were right." 

"What about the cows? The rocks everywhere in the field?" she asked. "Won't you be in trouble?" 

"Well, Jethry might try to make a pair of dragon-skin shoes out of me," he admitted. "But I did stack that hay in the barn, so I could argue that it almost makes us even." 

"We probably will be in trouble actually," Lisa cut in. "We'd better get back to Denver and smooth things over. An explosion that big, someone is bound to have reported it. I can tell the local authorities it was a training exercise or something." 

"Wasn't it?" Chris grinned cheekily, holding out his hand for her. 

*** 

This new, frightening magic consumed Chris for the rest of the week. To say he was distracted would be a gross understatement. 

After his self-study of physics and chemistry, the gravity of what he'd done was not lost on him. It kept him up at night. 

He kept up with developments in the construction of his house and helped sporadically, but his heart wasn't there. His mind was back in the old quarry, trying different variations, imagining outcomes, dreaming possibilities. 

Hailey's little suggestion had led him to a strange, quantum leap of magical capability. 

Michelle was exasperated but recognised his need to explore his magic. She gave him a reprieve from his limited duties for three days and a warning to have his head in the game when he got back. She didn't fully understand what he'd done but took his word when he said it was incredibly important. 

The image of that perfectly black orb haunted his sleep, tempering his rampant desire for experimentation. It seemed evil, dangerous, especially when he thought of its Ether twin, writhing fitfully with contained matter. In his mind's eye it seemed malignant, eager to explode to freedom. He knew he had to be careful. A fuck-up or misunderstanding with that sort of tool could end in disaster on a worldwide scale. 

His solace was that he'd never heard of such a magic before. If he was the only one to discover such a thing, he wouldn't have to face it. No one was linked to the Ether like he was. 

In a distracted blur, he mumbled his way through the promised interview. A slightly portly middle-aged man seemed very gracious and impressed with him. He wasn't prodded for specifics he couldn't give as the detectives had done. All he wanted to do was phase-jump up to a secluded hollow he knew of in the deep, cold forest of Maine and start his work. 

He barely remembered the interview afterward, but Lillian assured him he didn't screw it up too much. Michelle was happy, he came across as genuine, uncomfortable with fame, and humble. The piece sparked a little renewed interest, but Chris' edited version of events stilled the wild speculation. That had been the plan. 

The experiments started cautiously. Vigilant of pesky, spying elves, he jumped to remote locations remembered from his childhood. It drew his attention to his need to travel widely. His teleportation was so far limited to places he could envision accurately. He hadn't gathered the courage to attempt it from a photograph yet, but the idea was very tempting. 

Safety measures were the first to be tested. The first order of business was to limit the rate of movement across the Ether barrier. So far, it worked on everything he could think to safely test. It was daunting but once he started tweaking the variables, a world of possibilities opened in his mind like a sun-warmed flower. Now he could specify what crossed into the orb and how much of it. 

For his standard tests, he imagined an orb the size of a tennis ball. There were so many options, but he started with light. It seemed the least dangerous thing to experiment with. All light in, nothing else in or out was his first attempt. Again, he was confronted with that pitch-black orb. It awoke an instinctual fear in his gut, but he faced it, mastering himself. 

Turns out it was harmless enough when you didn't let anything else in. He got a sense of a vast number of incredibly fast little sparks bouncing around inside. There were so many of them after just a few seconds, he shut off the intake. 

What happened when you concentrated and contained light? He didn't know and didn't want to find out the hard way. Instead of letting them all go at once, he tried setting a condition on their exit. If it worked, only every hundredth photon to collide with the interior of the orb would get out. 

The result was a flash so intense he was near blind for several moments. 

His mistake was speed. Photons were quick little buggers. At one in every hundred exiting, they were all out in much less than a second. He tried again, and again. At one photon escaping of every 10<sup>10</sup> he had a reasonable glow, a powerful flashlight that dimmed slowly over about a minute. That was enough for one day. 

Emelia Mayer was waiting outside his door when he got home. Apparently, Lillian had barred her from the apartment when she'd knocked looking for Chris. He struggled not to chuckle at the thought of the no doubt irate vampire he'd have to deal with that night. As usual, the doctor was there to pester him for a sample of his blood. Her work was stalled without further things to test. In her eyes, he recognised the same drive to discover and experiment, the same frustration at being held back. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 12|
--------------------------------------------
So, he gave in. For better or worse, the next day he met her to draw a few small vials of blood. He wasn't silly about it. That blood was probably worth a fortune on the black market, certainly enough to get you killed by a connoisseur vampire. 

He drew up a detailed, magically binding contract and they each placed a bloody fingerprint on it before she was even allowed to unpack her vials. Chris owned his blood, all experiments, all results, products, profits, rights, everything. He could revoke her access at any time. Emelia was simply borrowing and had to receive his express permission to do just about anything new with it. She was also under a strict confidentiality agreement, mostly for her own safety. 

The doctor's eyes seemed to gleam with greed as she eagerly pricked her finger and placed it on the imbued parchment. Even the harsh, magically enforced penalties didn't seem to bother the older woman. No matter, he had a brood to get back to, tomorrow's experiments to think about. 

Next, he played with the shape of the Ether pocket. A cube, cylinder, triangle, he could make just about any shape instead of a sphere. They all required more energy to form but the shapes helped his mind envision areas of differential permeability when he tried that next. 

The true power of the ability began to unfold then. 

He could filter oxygen or anything else out of the air with ease. Pressure and temperature on the inside became a danger when the orb became crowded, but he soon realised he could set limits or guidelines on these variables for a proportionally increased energy cost. 

It was incredible. 

He heated an orb until it flash burnt a pinecone in pure oxygen, holding all the heat generated captive. When released all at once through a tiny aperture in the orb, it melted a small section of a granite boulder. 

He could simply collect air and, at will, fire off high-pressure bursts with devastating close range force. 

Making the orbs completely permeable to light in both directions made their contents visible in the Norm with only a slight distortion, like looking through a prism. In the Ether, that unnerving purple writhing was always there. 

Moving the orb was simple. It followed his will remarkably readily but raised some other problems. What if someone tried to touch one? If the conditions were safe, nothing should happen. If they were wrong... well, plants didn't fare too well, and he imagined humans would be the same, only more screaming. 

He vowed to stay away from extreme pressure, high temperature experiments for the moment. At least until he could find a safer place to play. Fusion was off the table for now but the more he thought about it, the more possible it seemed. 

Hailey came along sometimes to watch. It was difficult for her because she didn't share his intimate knowledge of what was happening inside the orbs, but her outsider's viewpoint was vital. She was the one who noticed that the orb conformed with Chris' ideas of abstract concepts. 

For example, if Chris told the orb to let 'that rock' in, it went in. He didn't have to specify the collection of atoms making up the rock. Therefore, could a person enter the orb? 

That led to experiments with living objects. In general, they were just fine inside an orb, if the conditions for their survival were met and if they weren't chopped in half by the orb boundary during a 'permeability change' as he liked to call them. 

A large grey squirrel did not appreciate their attention but emerged unscathed from the orb after a brief flight around the wintery, leafless treetops. He tutted and chattered his impotent furry, his expressive tail telling them exactly what he thought of their experiments. 

Hailey also introduced him to the idea of incorporating math, formula, and measurement into the orbs. He could tell an orb to automatically expand or contract, disband, become permeable or just about anything else in response to predetermined instructions. If he wanted a pinecone to burn at a specific temperature, he could tell the orb to automatically contract if it was too cool, expand if too hot, or vary the permeability of oxygen to suit. Hailey was very excited about these capabilities when it came to fusion, but he was only scratching the surface. It was hard to picture all the conditions, the logic instructions, as he formed the sphere. 

She practically jumped up and down in excitement as he magically heated a piece of argentite he'd found until it disintegrated into its constituent atoms, the sphere automatically expanding to maintain a pressure no greater than two atmospheres. 

It was easy when he shrunk the orb, expelling all atoms except silver in a sulphurous cloud. It contracted down until he was met with the resistance of solid matter. Tempted to push further and see what happened, he stopped himself, dispelling the magic gradually. When he handed her a perfect inch-wide ball-bearing of silver, she looked at him in awe. 

He had to agree, it was awesome. 

Worried that his new ability might have something to do with his unusual heritage, he dragged a certain reluctant Drow out of her Compound to accompany him. He jumped them up to the lake in Alaska where he'd first transformed into a dragon. 

She didn't understand his explanation until he showed her. 

Starting with an orb the size of a volleyball, he dragged it roughly through the downed trunk of a windblown conifer. In the dusky light of evening, the large trunk cracked and disintegrated loudly, falling to dust and small chips. 

"It's set to collect carbon, nothing else," he explained to her puzzled look. 

"All I see with my senses is a sphere of powerful Ether presence," she said as he swirled the orb artfully above their heads, heating and contracting. "I don't understand how you could possibly collect a single atom, nor why you would wish to collect carbon." 

"Is that so?" he asked smugly, sensing that under such exact conditions, the atoms were rapidly taking on a dense, highly ordered structure. A few more minutes to cool slowly and he placed a fist sized uncut diamond in her slightly trembling hand. He knew the quality was so perfect it would be considered a fake, technically, it was a fake. Still, it was a queenly gift. 

"Dragon, whatever you have discovered is truly a wonderful and terrifying ability." 

"I'm only just getting started, Reyla. Have you ever heard of such an ability, to shape the Ether so?" 

"No." The look in her silvery eyes was respectful, even fearful these days when she looked at him. "Never in all my years. Here, take your diamond." 

He smiled down at her, so beautiful, natural, in the forest surrounding. He realised he'd never seen her outside of a building before. Perhaps she didn't like being above ground. He'd meant the diamond as a gift and despite himself, generosity got the better of him again. 

He plucked the heavy diamond from her hand with a wink and vanished into the Ether. From all around the grey landscape he pulled, gathering magic, forcing it directly down into the diamond. It wasn't nearly as efficient or enjoyable as joining with one of his brood, but it worked. As the energy of the Ether rushed to join his effort, flooding into the mostly opaque gemstone, he watched the elf look around in confusion and frustration. Perhaps she thought her ride home had just bailed. 

A few minutes later, the scowling elf sitting haughtily on the remnants of the log, he merged back in beside her. 

"Here," he said, plopping the now faintly purple gem in her lap before she could voice her bottled anger. "I'd thought a diamond that big would pretty much seal the deal. Turns out with elves you have to fill them with magic, too." 

"What do you want in return?" Her white eyebrows scrunched together, long ears drooping. Elfin suspicion was deeply ingrained. 

"It's a gift, Reyla. You know, something given freely," he chuckled, shaking his head and gesturing at their surroundings. "We're trying to trust each other, aren't we? I'm here, telling you about all this." 

"A gift," she muttered, looking down at the diamond and the incredible wealth of magic he'd stuffed into such a perfect stone. Her ears happily perked up, but she looked away from him abruptly. 

"Reyla, what's the matter?" he asked, squatting in front of her. He was astonished to see glistening tears on the ancient woman's cheeks. It was awkward, his instinctive reaction to reach for and comfort her was wrong. She was not one of his brood and would not appreciate being touched. 

"If it is truly a gift..." she sniffed and wiped delicately at her tears with the back of ebony hands. "Never mind... it has been a long time since I received such without thought of recompense. I will cherish it forever." 

"Well, that's sad. You need to make more friends," he offered in an attempt to lighten her mood. Angry elf was much better than sad elf. "You're not supposed to cherish it by the way, you're supposed to use it." 

"But... but it's so much magic, surely there's something I must do..." 

"Stop," he said more firmly, in his dragon's tone this time. "It is a gift, elf. If you don't want it, say so plainly. If you must justify it, do so. I did not seek anything from you except trust and friendship." 

She stiffened, her posture becoming regal once more, even with the diamond clutched to her breast. 

"Thank you, dragon. I will use it wisely." 

"No, you should spend it frivolously," the dragon spoke back. "I think you need a bit more fun in your life." 

*** 

It came as a surprise then when Lillian tracked him down one evening as he played with his magic. He was sitting in an old deck chair on the warehouse floor above his new home. A tiny, glowing Ether orb flitting around his head as he pondered how far he should exploit his new powers. 

The sound of her heels alerted him to someone's presence, he assumed it was Susan or possibly Annabel. The vampire very seldom wore such impractical shoes. 

"You're brooding like an evil wizard again, my love," she spoke as she approached. "If I didn't know better I'd think there was trouble on the homefront." 

"No," he turned to look at her. "I'm trying to... Oh, Lillian... you're so beautiful." 

She was a vision. Her voluptuous, hourglass figure was on full display in a rather unconventional outfit. The vampire's penchant for leather was in full swing, displaying her undeniable feminine allure tinged with a martial theme. 

Her dress was made completely of dark, soft leather. On top, it was very nearly a bikini, straining to contain her magnificent pale breasts. The edge of the cups and shoulder straps were stitched through with gold in an elaborate, swirling pattern. It accentuated her sinful curves and the expanse of creamy cleavage on display perfectly. 

At her pinched waist, the cups merged into a figure hugging, ornamented belt which flared out over her wide hips. Finally, it transformed into a roman-style short skirt of thin, gold-studded straps. The leather leaves of her skirt rattled softly together as she stalked, exposing a lot of thick, velvety thigh. Finally, his eyes met her feet, wrapped in matching high heeled sandals, the straps of which wound up around her firm calves. 

Still the most striking aspect of her attire was the teardrop shaped window over her soft tummy, glorifying her pregnancy to anyone who saw her. She even wore a tiny jewel, a carved purple dragon, attached by a golden chain to her exposed belly button. 

Lillian was a sight to behold, made up, hair pinned in an elaborate braid. She looked fierce and devastatingly beautiful. 

Over everything she wore an almost ceremonial dark green cloak. Open at the front, it looked like it was being held off the dusty floor by an invisible barrier, probably her telekinesis. White fur lined its edges, more for decoration than for any protection from the cold but it completed the martial look with aplomb. All she needed was a sword at her hip and a spear in her hand. Chris knew she needed no such weapons to be deadly. 

He stood quickly to greet her, letting the orb burn itself out with a few seconds of increased bright illumination. 

She curtsied for him, something he'd never imagined her doing, even if her wicked grin was in full force. 

"My amazon goddess," he breathed, eyes devouring her. 

"Young one," she moved closer, so their bodies touched, her hands on his chest. "You say the most delightful things to melt my old heart." 

They kissed, tender and with longing, but not for nearly long enough. 

"It is time, Chris," she looked up at him seriously as she separated them. "Reyla is already entertaining the delegates of the Vampire Council." 

"Right now? Already?" he protested. 

"Yes!" she laughed. "I warned you several times, but you've been so preoccupied with your new magic lately. Later tonight, we'll leave to take care of that unfinished business with you know who... Don't worry, Michelle and I have organised everything. There's a new tuxedo waiting for you at the apartment. All you have to do for now is get changed and wear me proudly on your arm." 

"Lillian, you are amazing, smart, deadly, beautiful beyond words..." 

"Go on," she simpered. 

"And I love you," he stated boldly. "I'm sorry, my mind has been on other things." 

"Oh, my sweet dragon," the ancient vampire looked up at him searchingly before nuzzling her face into his neck. "I love you, too. Whatever happens tonight, know that I do love you and our child." 

He was about to ask what might happen tonight, but her fangs pricked his skin gently, a tiny little taste to cement their admission of love. He didn't want to ruin the moment, so he held her until she kissed and licked the minute wound closed. 

"Let's go." 

*** 

He fidgeted in his black, tight fitting tuxedo as they walked through the almost deserted corridors of the Compound. Their destination was a seldom used banquet hall, around one third the size of the great hall Reyla presided over for court. 

Those few Beings who were around at this time of night stared avidly at the couple as they glided past. Their size, beauty, and air of competence was imposing yet eye-catching at the same time. 

"Stop that," the vampire scolded gently. "I do love a man in a fine tuxedo, but they have to wear it well. Try to act like that spy in those silly movies you like. Now, he knows how to wear a tux." 

"Baryst. Chris Baryst," he smiled. "I'll take my vampire shaken, not stirred." 

"Huh," she grunted. "You can take me however you damn well please after we get through this." 

"What's wrong?" 

"It was supposed to be a quiet little gathering of vampires and a few relevant parties such as yourself and Reyla, but word got around and others have invited themselves, namely the day elves," she explained. "A few of the higher ranking local Beings too." 

"House Lefayd, I suppose?" 

"Yes, amongst two others." 

"Damn, I've never met one of them but they're already on my nerves." 

They rounded a final corner in the subterranean castle, before them, the grand doors to the banquet hall stood guarded by two of Reyla's security team. Chris was surprised to recognise the dark-haired vampire who'd attacked him on his first day here in Denver. 

"Amanda," Lillian acknowledged smugly as the door swung inward. 

Chris gave the young vampire a tentative smile, not wishing to appear either too friendly or arrogant for ignoring her. 

The chorus of many voices quieted as they entered. Around the room, groups of Beings stilled their conversation to look towards the door, the impossibly pregnant vampire and her powerful dragon mate. Fine canapes paused on the way to mouths as they were openly stared at. It made Chris uncomfortable but most of all, it reawakened his hunger. Unfortunately for him, the delicious morsels floating magically around the room on bronze trays were saved his remorseless predation by their hostess. 

Reyla quickly strode over to them, taking control before anyone too ambitious or solicitous ran afoul of the pair. Eramir Lefayd, representative of the Synod was here with his entourage. Of all the people who could have shown up, only the elf's brother would have been worse. 

"Come with me, please," she said formally after Chris and Lillian each gave her a small bow. 

In what might have appeared an impropriety, she took Chris' other hand and led them towards a few figures sitting around a small table near the back of the room. The familiarity did not go unnoticed, several groups broke into hushed whispering, the speculation becoming bolder and louder as they passed. 

<em>"This is a disaster waiting to happen,"</em> Reyla spoke to Chris through their skin contact. "<em>The vampires are offended, not with either of us of course. This was supposed to be private, but it's obvious now that the elves have used what they've seen in the Eye to disrupt this meeting. I don't know what they have planned but tread carefully, please, dragon."</em> 

<em>"Don't I always?"</em> he teased. 

<em>"No, you don't! If you did then... Oh, an attempt at humour. Very well. Heed my warning though, be vigilant. The Council's guards are everywhere, and the elves have competent fighters amongst them."</em> 

That was all they had time for as the table was fast approaching, the cloaked figures were rising. 

<em>"Thank you for the warning, Reyla."</em> 

Three of the seven elder vampires had travelled to see them. It was a high honour indeed. Chris recognised Vladimir Sokolov who held the Synod seat for all vampire kinds. The other two, a short man with long brown hair and an elderly African woman, he didn't recognise. 

Lillian curtsied respectfully to the leaders of her race. 

"My lords, my lady. May I introduce my mate, Christopher Baryst, class one dragon." 

Chris tried to bow solemnly but was interrupted by the tingle of magic surrounding their little corner of the busy room. 

"Let us dispense with formalities," Vladimir spoke slowly in a gentle but heavy European accent. "I have sealed us away from prying eyes or ears for the moment. No doubt we will find some contrivance or other interrupting us in short order so let us get to the point. Lillian, daughter of my essence, we came here to discuss the monumental conception of your child. These are Asha and Matias, council for Africa and Antarctica respectively." 

"Antarctica?" Chris couldn't help himself, even if his interruption was a little rude. Thankfully it seemed to be some sort of an inside joke because all the vampires smiled. 

"Indeed," Matias spoke in a rich tenor. "A council chair I took by accident whilst fleeing my homeland, Chile. No one has been bothered to challenge me for it yet, I think I am the only vampire on the continent. My subjects are penguins, seals, and seabirds. They care not for my rule." 

"Well, it's an honour to meet you all," Chris tried to recover. 

"The honour is ours, Devine," the old dark-skinned woman spoke hoarsely. "I did not think it possible, but, you have their scent, so... enticing." 

"So, it is true!" Vladimir's voice was full of excitement now. "I suspected but..." 

"It is so," Asha confirmed. "I do not remember that far back but my beast knows the smell intimately. It is all I can do to not leap on him." 

Lillian shifted uncomfortably, pulling her mate closer. 

"Relax, young one," the stooped old woman continued. "I would hardly attack one such as he, especially as he has crossed his line with ours. This is a wonderful thing for our kind." 

"What do you mean?" Lillian looked questioningly at her elders. 

"They think I'm an Old God, Lillian," Chris spoke. "Reyla's theory agrees to some extent, she says I've been influenced by one somehow. It all revolves around that mysterious encounter I had months ago with the psychic entity." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 13|
--------------------------------------------
"You've spoken with them?" Vladimir almost choked on his eagerness. "What news of the war? Is it over?!" 

"No, not spoken. It was a very strange and one sided mental communication. There was no mention of any war." 

"And that's how you gave me a child..." Lillian stared over their heads, puzzle pieces fitting into place. "Your other heritage, why you taste so perfect and brim with life force." 

"Yes, child," Asha intoned. "He has their creative spark." 

"What does it mean for the baby?" Chris asked. "Will it be... whole?" 

"I think so but who can say? The Old Ones were ever chasing perfection. I doubt their seed would spawn an abomination, even with our own stock, enemy stock." 

"What of the prophecy?" Matias broke his silent observation in a hushed tone. "Is it true? We will walk in the sunlight again?" 

"Have you tried, Lillian?" the European lord asked. 

"No, of course not!" Lillian hissed. "I'm pregnant." 

"I would advise a small experiment then," Vlad grinned toothily. "Nothing too risky, perhaps a weak ultraviolet light. How fitting it would be for the first mother of our race to feel the warm kiss of sunshine again." 

Lillian shuddered at the thought, the very idea of sunlight was distasteful. Chris stroked her hand reassuringly with his thumb. 

"Well, how do we play this?" Chris asked. "Obviously I don't want everyone to know I'm somehow related to the Old Gods." 

"You may have little choice," Asha husked, shaking her greying head. "We have figured it out, so has your night elf, the other elves must know too. Why else would they be here tonight?" 

"Then they will seek control over you, Chris," Vladimir warned. "Do not indulge them anything. You have my personal guarantee of support and protection for Lillian and the rest of your mates. Their babes must be protected as well. With the Revelation almost upon us, it is past time the elves learned that they cannot stick their greedy fingers into every pie." 

"Thank you," Chris said solemnly. "I will not tolerate any move against one of my own and any who try will not like the cost." 

"Good. Your mind is on the right track then, dragon." 

"Someone comes," Matias warned. 

"Be well, my children," Asha blessed them. "You have done a wonderful thing for our people, for all Beings. Thanks to you, there may yet be a day when our kind is not a blight on the living and it starts with your precious child." 

"I'm sorry," Reyla spoke as she crossed the magical dampening barrier around their covert gathering. "Eramir is demanding to have Lillian examined by his pet magician. He is dogged, and I have held him at bay for as long as propriety allows in our culture." 

"So, it begins," Vladimir sneered. "I trust, daughter, that you have learned enough from your time with this dark skin that submitting to such an examination would be a grave error." 

"Reyla has taught me many things," Lillian cocked her head in acknowledgement. 

*** 

"A resource such as you must be protected, managed... with finesse," the elf said, tall, blonde, and almost crooning his words out to the gathered Beings. "We cannot have you spreading your seed simply wherever your fancy takes you. At least let us examine your mate." 

"No," Chris spoke firmly, for the third time already in this little performance. Lillian had been less polite. 

"But why?" The elf whined in a sing-song voice. He twirled on his pointy boots, pacing back the other way in front of his audience, his tone switching saccharine. "See reason, dragon. Do you not wish to be assured of your child's wellbeing?" 

"No," he stood his ground, looking directly behind the courtly elf to Eramir Lefayd and his five strong party of House Lefayd. Whilst not the only elves in the room, they were obviously the root of his problems. They were all so tall and beautiful, so alien. In the fairy tales he'd read as a child, elves were benevolent. He wondered now if it had all been a dastardly ploy by these plotting, power-hungry creatures to tint human opinion of them. "My mate has already declined. Now you come to me, what, to change her mind? I cannot, would not, and I don't trust you." 

The rest of the audience shuffled backwards half a step as the implication hung in the air. 

"What did we ever do to earn such scorn, dragon?" the elf shook his head sadly, conveying very clearly that Chris was being unreasonable. "Would you deny us our duty, to investigate such a rare and... wonderful occurrence? Surely it is for the good of all that we know exactly what you have planted in the vampire's womb. It might be very dangerous." 

Several murmurs of agreement rose around the room. 

Chris frowned, beginning to wonder if they'd seeded the crowd. He had to give it to the unknown elf, the man had a way with words and knew how to play the audience. Heaven forbid, was he some sort of elf lawyer? 

He was about to retort angrily that his dead parents might have something to say on the matter when the doors of the banquet hall burst open. 

Reyla shrieked in outrage as the crowd got a glimpse of the small battle taking place at the entrance way. It looked like the guards were outnumbered, in the process of being subdued in hand to hand combat by a small force of dark-clad fighters. In their midst, a figure in a bright red cloak strode forth haughtily. It was the same style the other vampires wore. 

Chris's arm shot out to grip the enraged elf before she could run into the fray. She spared him a glare but turned her ire back on the approaching figure. 

"What is the meaning of this!" Reyla spat, tugging her arm away from the dragon but staying nearby. "I should have you whipped!" 

The red garbed woman simply kept walking forward, her arms now open at her sides in an embracing, almost peaceful gesture. The combat behind them stopped abruptly, the attackers ceasing their onslaught now that their mistress had reached her goal. She was sauntering now, her hips cocking with each graceful step. 

Vladimir and Matias groaned in unified frustration, though her hood was still covering her face, they somehow recognised the figure. 

"What are you doing here, Lakshmi?" Asha's old voice carried with a note of power. Beside him, Lillian flinched at the name, her muscles tensing. A long, almost silent hiss, escaped her perfect red lips as her fangs came out. 

"I come to accept the dragon's seed, of course," the woman spoke in accented English. 

Her voice was sweet, rich, and seductive, carrying what Chris assumed was an Indian inflection. Her words didn't really register though because without any warning, she let her cloak slip to pool on the granite floor. Beneath, her light brown skin almost glistening with vitality, she was completely naked. The rest of the audience was stunned to silence, eagre to let the drama play out. 

"You will do no such thing," Lillian said softly, her voice carrying a whisper of death. 

"And why not, little whore?" the brown beauty sneered, white fangs flashing. "I am over twice your age, a goddess of beauty and prosperity. I will carry the serpent's child and fulfil the prophecy for our people, not you." 

Chris spared a glance around the room and was disgusted to find the elves smiling smugly to each other. This was insane. 

"Leave, Lakshmi," Vlad stepped forward, his voice sounding almost tired. "You have no place here. You shame us all with your discourteous entrance. I hate to even guess how you found out about this gathering." 

"It does not matter how I found out," Lakshmi flicked her long, silky, black hair dismissively, her full, pert breasts quivering enticingly with the motion. "I am here now, and I will not leave until I have new life in my womb. Please dragon, do I not delight your eyes? Do you not wish to rut me, to plant your seed in..." 

"LEAVE!" the old vampire shrieked, the terrifying power over three thousand years of undead existence behind his voice. His skin paled, veins bulging, his jaw elongating into the beginning of some hideous transformation. Many in the room retreated from the vampire lord but nothing more happened as he glared at his disobedient underling with black eyes. 

"Not even you can force me!" Lakshmi cried back defiantly, though her bottom lip quivered. "I claim my right by combat. I will have what is hers once she is dead! It is my right!" 

Vladimir let out a savage snarl, almost launching himself on the woman but Matias boldly took a grip on his wrist to steady him. 

"No, Vlad, by our laws she has the right. You will forfeit your position if you interfere." 

"But... the child," the old vampire relented, his features fading back to normal. 

Matias only sighed and shook his head. 

"So, it comes to this?" Lillian muttered to herself, her body quivered in both fear and excitement. 

"Say the word Lillian, we'll be out of here in an instant," Chris tried to reassure her. 

"Now, now, dragon," Eramir Lefayd finally spoke almost paternally. "A blood challenge has been issued in front of witnesses. It must be fulfilled." 

"You!" Chris rounded on the influential elf with a snarl. "All of this is your doing!" 

"A venomous and meritless accusation," the lawyer-elf grimaced in mock hurt at his lord's side. 

"Stop, my love," Lillian's hand brushed down his spine as he took a breath to bellow his challenge back at the poisonous elf. "I accept the challenge." 

"What?! Lillian, no," he took her in his arms, squeezing her fiercely as he whispered. "It's a stupid law, let's run. I can't lose you again." 

She gently released herself from his desperate grip, looking up into his blue eyes to see moisture brimming at the corners. Oh, her adorable, innocent, dragon. He truly did love her, didn't he? 

"Trust me?" she grinned wide. 

He nodded shakily. 

"Then watch my back, you too, Reyla." 

"However this ends, that Hindi bitch won't leave my territory alive," the furious elf promised. 

Lillian's own green cloak slid to the floor as she kissed him one last time, turned, and strode confidently toward her challenger. 

The two stunning vampires eyed each other warily, beginning a slow circling dance of maintained distance. Their bodies were both perfect examples of femininity; Lillian's leather clad curves and powerful muscles, Lakshmi's smaller, sleeker, but well-proportioned nakedness. They reminded him of yowling cats, it might take a while but once it started, he knew the fighting would be intense. 

Chris' breath caught in his throat at the thought of them fighting, of Lillian... he shuddered, unwilling to concede the possibility. He tried to call on the dragon's calming presence but found only a hot pool of righteous fury. It settled over him, bringing back his focus and determination. His predatory eyes settled on the group of elves, his dragon lurking millimetres under his skin, ready to pounce. 

"I think I'll enjoy rutting your dragon once I've drained you dry. Quite the handsome young pup isn't he?" Lakshmi taunted, taking a confident step toward the younger but larger vampire. 

"He would split you in half," Lillian sneered, stepping a little further to the side to stay out of her opponent's striking range, biding her time for the perfect opportunity. "Goddess of beauty indeed, he would break a little twig like you." 

"He will be mine!" the darker vampire hissed back. "I will bear his children. I will be the mother of our race!" 

"You think he will have you? Still, after all this?" Lillian shook her head, watching Lakshmi's shoulders and torso for the coming attack. The other vampire lunged forward but it was a feint, Lillian side-stepped away again, building her opponent's frustration. "He loves me, you know. He will never breed you, even if you defeat me." 

"If?" Lakshmi sneered, her fangs flashing white and eager. 

"If," Lillian nodded smugly. 

That did it. 

Chris watched in awe as Lakshmi charged, shrieking bloody murder. She was smaller but probably a lot stronger and more resilient than Lillian. Just as the wrathful vampire was almost upon her, black talons raised to strike at Lillian's torso, she stumbled. It almost looked like she'd been shoved hard from behind, for indeed, she had. 

Lillian stepped to the side as Lakshmi's battle cry wavered with uncertainty. She kept up the telekinetic push, shoving hard with her power even as she flung herself on the smaller woman's back with another push of magic and rode her down. Her power was strong but today it seemed to be taxing her hard, no matter, it would be over soon. 

She punched, black talons held together in a spike even as her knee connected a savage blow to the woman's kidney. Undead or not, such a blow delivered debilitating pain. Lakshmi's blood curdling scream wasn't for her kidney though. 

Her strike was true, her claws sank between her rival's third and fourth rib, cracking bone as she expanded her fist. She ripped through lung like tissue paper as her other hand twisted savagely in the woman's long, pitch black hair. They finally hit the mottled marble floor, thudding to an unnaturally sudden stop as Lillian pitilessly tugged Lakshmi's head to the side. Her aim was true, her fangs tore open the screaming woman's neck even as her fist, searching, shredding, ripping, found her shuddering heart. 

Lillian held on for dear life as the older vampire struggled vainly. She kept her teeth gnawing, opening the carotid again and again as it regenerated, spilling her challenger's blood in a great pool on the white stone below. All her power was now focused on holding the bucking woman down with telekinesis, especially her thrashing taloned hands. It was no easy feat and she was tiring at an alarming rate, but every time Lakshmi struggled, she shredded her own heart anew. 

The audience stood by silently, the efficient brutality of the younger vampire was frightening to behold. Lakshmi's weakening, ineffectual struggles and gurgling shrieking soon made it clear who was to be the victor. Chris couldn't help noticing the elves' disappointment, his anger crested. 

Finally, Lillian raised her head, face bloody and savage even as Lakshmi's artery spurted hot and red in a great, arching splatter. 

"Surrender or Die!" his triumphant mate screamed her ultimatum, her entire front soaked in her vanquished enemy's blood. 

A wretched burble was her only response, but Lillian took it to mean surrender. She had the choice to kill Lakshmi, but she'd learned long ago that it was best to avoid killing whenever possible. Removing a vampire such as Lakshmi left a huge power vacuum in her old territory and inevitably caused problems. She rolled quickly away from her defeated opponent, only releasing her telekinetic grip after she'd regained her feet a little unsteadily. She was tired, exhausted, and she could really use a sip of dragon. 

She found her mate, his eyes holding both love and a little fear of her, the perfect combination. As she collected herself, spat out Lakshmi's unsatisfying blood, and sauntered back toward him, she was gratified to see the bulge in his form fitting black pants. So, he liked that, did he? 

Chris's eyes were glued to his bloodied, victorious amazon. How could he have ever doubted her? Something tickled his magical senses as she approached, red-slicked chest heaving. It was a subtle little niggle, setting the tiny hairs on his arms up straight. 

Now that Lillian was close, Reyla felt it too, her eyes narrowing and darting about. They fell on the Lefayd party, muttering nervously to each other. They were the culprits, the instigators... the invaders. One of them, the quiet one, stood behind the rest... fluttering eyelids, vacant eyes. Were they that bold? That stupid? 

She was brimming with energy and rage this evening and finally, she had something to act upon. Tired of playing the placating host, she twisted her fingers in an elaborate pattern behind her back, forming runes one after another. Normally she would never spend her magic so frivolously, but the dragon at her side was generous beyond reason. She would get to the bottom of this 'high elf' meddling and end it. 

"Shelameenii veloth!" she shouted commandingly as the spell completed. 

Startled cries rose from her hapless subjects around the room. She cared not, they'd all been enticed, bullied, or simply invited themselves here this evening. A whispering, sucking wind blew through the hall, lights dimming as her powerful detection spell took hold. She'd been refining and practicing this one for a while, this was the perfect opportunity to test. 

Around the room, enchanted trinkets, concealed magical weapons, jewellery, and even people began to glow. The dragon, of course pulsed a decadent, dim purple, his power bottled away for the moment. Her own rings glowed various hues, blue, pink, red, and black according to the magic they contained or channelled. 

The elves across the room stood stock still, their various objects and spells glowing for all to see. Worst of all was the sickly green line twisting out from the silent elf, its tendrils tugging at Lillian. 

"Fool!" Eramir Lefayd, representative of the Synod, turned and backhanded his vacant subordinate even as the dragon roared his rage. Everyone had seen the malicious, insidious spell. 

"Witnesses!" The dragon bellowed, wings sprouting from his back even as he lunged powerfully toward them. He was vengeance incarnate in that moment, his huge, hybrid purple mass barrelling down on the six elves. His magic furled open like a young fern, spreading wide around the room. "You have wronged me for the lasssst time!" 

A silver bubble of protective magic shimmered into life in front of Eramir as the dragon spread his wings and ploughed headlong into their midst. They toppled like so many bowling pins, flying backwards into walls, bystanders, and even a tray of hors d'oeuvres. 

Beings cried out, scattering away from the vengeful dragon and the foolish elves who tempted his rage. 

He held a small Ether orb ready in his huge left hand, his right battering into the ruined face of the elf who had been draining Lillian, draining his child. He'd struck the man in the gut with his flying knee, Lillian would have been proud. Now he knelt over him, his enormous purple form in a ruined black tux, wailing down thudding blows remorselessly. Blood splattered against the dragon's cream colored chest, painting him a rich, livid red. The elf was already dead, but he felt wronged it had been so quick for the wicked, scheming creature. 

From the corner of his eye, quick, graceful movement warned him of an attack. Two elves came at him from the left, razor thin glass knives drawn from concealed sheathes. He flung the orb at them, willing it zip and chop through their bodies. Everything in, nothing out. Fuck his rules, fuck his limits, high pressure, high temperature. It turned that unearthly black and shot silently forward to its bloody task. They looked like Swiss cheese moments later as someone threw up noisily behind him. 

The searing heat on his tiny scales was the only warning he got before a huge fireball exploded into his right side. It scorched, dripping molten magical goo over him and the floor, setting him alight like a napalm fire. He screamed in pain and frustration at his distracted mistake, taking refuge in the Ether. He made sure to mark the position of the smug magician-elf. It only took a few second to teleport into Jethry's pond, the icy water dousing the sticky flames before they cooked him too much.  

The elf was looking around warily as the elder vampires, Reyla, and her swarming security force formed up in an impenetrable front, pulling Lillian back into their midst. The twitching body of the defeated vampire lay forgotten, slowly closing its wounds in an empty no-man's land of marble. 

The gravity of their folly dawned on the mage as he realised that even if he'd damaged the dragon, they still had to fight their way out. His eyes fell on the bloody, hole-punched corpses of his cousins, their lives spent so he could launch his spell undistracted. That dark orb, reeking of Ether magic, unmoving now above their ruined bodies. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 14|
--------------------------------------------
He never felt a thing as the dragon's bloody fist crashed into the back of his neck with the force of a sledgehammer. Ether magic bowed his protective charms, kinetic energy snapped them, ramming onward onto crunching bone, grinding cartilage, and silent nerves. 

The dragon snarled, stepping over the twitching body of the mage. His right side was no longer a regal purple. He was blackened, scorched red and weeping along his shoulder and flank. It made him look even more terrible. 

Eramir and the elf who had twisted his words so artfully whirled at his bestial call. 

"Now look here dragon, I..." 

"SSilencce!" he shouted, voice booming and sibilant. The orb flew into action, zipping in to whirl around the elves, caging them even as it sucked in every atom of air it touched. 

He closed his eyes, letting his magic expand and search, outward, upwards. It didn't have to go far, at the top of the room, concealment weakened by Reyla's spell, sat the glowing green Eye of Ivinos. 

The room collectively looked upward as the dragon's attention stripped away any remaining shielding. The more magically informed and savvy amongst them gasped as they recognised the presence of the legendary artefact. 

Chris pushed his magic further, willing it into the manifestation of the eye and back along the conduits of power. It was a struggle, his sense of the eye was slippery when he grasped for it. It struggled as he homed in, writhing like a freshly caught eel. Finally he had it, his vision opening to a room atop a stone tower, lit by early morning sun. 

"Run," he whispered evilly to the five gathered elves. They'd seen what he'd done and heeded his warning. Elves scattered down the narrow stairs, tripping over each other in their haste to get away from the vengeful dragon who'd somehow traced them back to their stronghold. One elf even vaulted out a large window, activating a gliding spell to coast over the palisade walls of the castle and run into the surrounding woods. That one obviously had common sense. 

Chris took stock of the room, committing it to memory through his hijacked vision of the huge emerald in the padded dais. When he was happy, he plucked his orb from the air, binding it to the motion of his hand, and teleported half way across the globe. 

He was back seconds later, panting from exertion, but grinning from ear to ear. Above them, the green light flickered out. Somewhere in Switzerland, a remote, magically protected valley was rocked by a deafening explosion. The tower crumpled down onto the ramparts. 

"What have you done?" Eramir looked around in panic. "The Synod will..." 

"The Synod will punish you," Vladimir spoke levelly. "I have witnessed everything that happened tonight. You will be charged and put in a cell if I have my way. I wonder what more Lakshmi will reveal when we feed her truth syrup?" 

"But... the Eye, my guards... What are you?" the elf turned on Chris in disbelief. 

Reyla had the wits to provide an answer lest the dragon simply roar out the truth in his enraged frenzy. She had seen her share of bloodshed, of battle crazed warriors. The hulking dragon-man certainly counted right now, and he needed to be managed carefully, calmed into a more rational state. 

"He is a dragon. You attacked his mate and child as soon as it was clear he could not be controlled so easily," she sneered at the embodiment of her long-time adversary. "For what? To have your own pet vampire mother a child? What did you think would happen, Eramir? That a dragon such as he would simply roll over and submit to your little schemes. Ridiculous. At least you had the sense not to join the melee. On your behalf, I ask that you spare his life, please Chris? He has much to answer for." 

"I don't answer to you, Reyla Narlakis, and I will not grovel for your protection now," the Lefayd leader found some of his old arrogance. "The dragon does not attack me because he knows the consequences would be dire!" 

Chris chuckled darkly, holding back his instinct to punch the man. 

"The only reason I stay my hand is so you can answer to your house, to the Synod, for instigating this attack on my mate. Do you wish the same treatment as thossse two?" 

The dragon pointed a gory claw at the mangled elf bladesmen. The elf glanced at the corpses, his face paling. The young man had dispatched his guards so effortlessly. 

"No. No, of course not," Eramir wrung his slender fingers together. After so many years assured of his superiority, feeling helpless and exposed was terrifying. How had it all gone so wrong? 

His apprentice, Keltra, whimpered pathetically at his side and the dragon's attention swivelled like a hawk toward the young elf. 

"You!" the purple beast hissed, dripping hatred from his forked tongue. "Wordssssssmith..." 

In a flash of rage, the dragon phased forward and through the hapless elf, the goblin's purse-cutting technique used in pure cruelty for the first time. 

Keltra screamed hoarsely through closed lips, blood seeping at the corners of his mouth. He blanched, tears streaming down his beautiful face. He choked, gagged. Finally, with a horrid, guttural moan, the elf spat his wriggling, bloody tongue out onto the floor. 

"Good Lord, dragon," Matias stepped in front of the vengeful beast as he rounded on the two elves. "Remind me to never get on your bad side. I think even Asha's stomach might turn if you carry on." 

"I have no objections so far," the ancient, wrinkled vampire nodded toward the remaining elves. "Matias is correct though, they have had enough of your vengeance. Tend to your mate, young Christopher." 

He shot a look back over his shoulder at the two cowed elves and let Matias lead him through the fearful throng of Beings. They parted easily before him. None who had witnessed the dragon's brutal wrath were unmoved by the grisly spectacle. 

Lillian left Reyla's concerned tutting behind and flung herself into his embrace. They wrapped around each other like two mating snakes, his great purple and white wings forming a cocoon around her. They didn't care that they were bloodied, bruised, or burned, simply that they were together. 

"Are you okay?" she whispered. 

"Are you?" 

"Yeah, I think so. Tired is all." 

"Me, too. I'll heal pretty quickly with an Ether sleep." 

"I'll heal pretty quickly with a light snack." 

"Does that mean we're still going to go settle our other unfinished... business?" he asked, kissing her unbloodied forehead. 

"I don't see why not. You seem to be in the mood for vengeance." 

"I am," he frowned thoughtfully as they started toward the door. 

Every eye in the room watched them leave with bated breath. Only the trays of nearly untouched fancy snacks seemed not to care, still floating and bobbing merrily around the chamber. One strayed too close as the dragon reached the doorway and was cruelly dragged away from its brethren forever, the dragon's final victim. 

*** 

"Jesus H... what the hell happened to you?!" Michelle asked as she answered the door to the apartment. Lillian was still drenched in blood, Chris burned and splattered in reddish brown as well. 

"She fought a vampire, I murdered some elvesss," Chris, still in hybrid form put it about as succinctly as he could. 

"Are we cancelling the mission?" she asked. 

"No," said Lillian. "And we don't have to worry about the elves spying on us for the moment. Our dragon here killed it somehow." 

"Blew it up," Chris grinned as they followed each other into the main bathroom. 

Michelle followed, eager to hear more about the evening's events. 

"Is that what that was? Your new magic?" Lillian asked as she began stripping unceremoniously. 

"Yep," he was proud as he said it, but it brought back the fresh images of the hole-filled bodies. He shook his head, clearing the memory as the shower began to steam. 

"They had it coming," Lillian read his mind as she shimmied out of her leather skirt and began clawing through the remnants of his burnt tux. "Don't spare a thought for them." 

Michelle watched for a few moments, hoping to hear more. When it became apparent that things were only going to get more pornographic, she left and shut the door. 

"Be quick in there," she warned. "We've got a plane to catch." 

Worried and dealing with a severe lack of information, she took out her Maginet phone and began trolling the message boards for news of the confrontation. She was still sorting through the growing conversation chains when they got out of the bathroom, barely bothering to cover themselves with towels. 

"Is it true you killed four elves, cut out the tongue of another, and somehow destroyed an ancient, powerful artifact?" Michelle asked in disbelief as Lillian used her own towel to dry the back of Chris' great wings. 

"Yeah, that's pretty much how it went," he admitted around his forked tongue. "Do they mention the part about the elves setting up Lillian to be killed by another crazy vampire and then sssapping her whilst she was fighting her challenge?" 

"They do, actually, but it's getting drowned out under a mountain of speculation, fear, and hero-worship. Wha... Put some damn clothes on Chris! Just because we're comfortable with each other doesn't mean I want your fucking horse cock dangling in my face!" 

"Sssorry! Lillian grabbed... Sorry, Michelle," Chris covered himself with his wings, accepting defeat as Lillian dried his feet, smirking up at him with his towel in her clutches. "We were discussing in the shower that it might be funny to go to Lord Harcot's office in my hybrid form. It will be better for me during the long teleport and for my healing. I'll go get some shorts on and bring my other stuff in a backpack." 

"Go! Our filed flight plan out of Gatwick is not negotiable." 

Chris bustled off into his room, trying not to wake Immi and Annabel with his wings bumping into things as he hurriedly packed. 

Lillian, in her naked glory, watched the colour slowly fade from her friend's cheeks. She didn't have much time for any real button pushing so she strutted past Michelle to her own room and carefully laid out clothes. 

"You're missing out," she snickered over her shoulder. 

Michelle picked up a book from the nearby coffee table and threw it at the vampire. 

Five minutes later, Chris took his two soldiers by the hand and led them into the Ether. 

It was a bit of a challenge to remember Michael Harcot's well-appointed office. It had been over two months ago, and he'd been there only a brief time. They were depending on him to pull it off though, so he thought back to the conversation they'd shared, how Harcot had jokingly tried to convince he and Lillian to relocate to the UK. He felt more confident now, picturing a dark desk and the funny old telephone. 

The incorporeal sensation always gave Michelle the willies. When it stopped, they stood in front of a shorter man who sat behind a grand desk. He stood, beaming at them, and Chris' hybrid form in particular. Without a word he uncorked a nondescript bottle and began pouring an amber liquid into crystal tumblers already in position. A thick, potent, scent filled the room as Lord Harcot handed out the glasses. Lillian took it almost reverently, but Michelle and Chris were a little reluctant. 

"Here's to the fall of House Lefayd," the well-spoken lord of London finally broke his silence with a perfect upper class drawl. "Well done you two. I'll drink to that any day." 

Harcot and Lillian raised their glasses and downed the yellow liquid in one. Chris was a little taken aback that their host knew of the altercation already, but went with it. 

"What about the baby?" Michelle scowled at the vampire. 

"Ahh, that's the good stuff," Lord Harcot smacked his lips. "It's not alcoholic, my dear woman. Leprechaun whiskey is purely a magical concoction. Michelle, I presume?" 

"Oh, okay," now Michelle looked at the drink with even more suspicion. "Yes. It's nice to finally meet you, Lord Harcot. In person is so much better than over a conference call." 

"Agreed. You've been doing excellent work for the humans." 

Chris took a tentative sip of the brew and found it very much to his liking. It tingled his throat and made his belly nice and warm. It tasted musky but almost sweet, like strawberries, honey, and old wood. He downed the rest, his eyes squinting shut as a rush of invigorating magic swept through his body. 

"Try it, Michelle. It's good." 

"Chris," Harcot took a step forward to shake the hybrid dragon's giant purple hand enthusiastically. "The dragon of the hour! My god man, the size of you. No wonder you made such short work of those long-eared bastards." 

"You've had some dealings with Lefayd in the past?" Chris guessed from the powerful vampire's hostility. 

Behind them, Lillian coaxed Michelle to slug back her drink. Michelle blinked rapidly for several moments, her body unsure about the magic but being affected by it nonetheless. 

"Yes, they wronged me long ago when I was much younger and more gullible." 

"Well, I hope they learned their lesson from tonight," Chris glowered. "I can't believe they tried something like that on Lillian, she's barely two weeks pregnant." 

"It's worse," the vampire commiserated. "If their plan had gone off, Lakshmi would have killed Lillian. You sent a powerful message tonight though, Chris. I've read the brief report Lord Matias got out to the plus one thousand club. No one is going to forget that performance easily. Now, we'd better get you moving if you want to catch that plane. There's going to be traffic, so you'll be taking the helicopter. Better go back to human, aye chap?" 

*** 

The engines quieted as the sleek private jet levelled off. Chris relaxed back into the large, soft seat, eager to catch a few hours' sleep before the madness started up again. Why had the elves chosen this exact night to dump this on him? He was so tired now; fighting, healing, and jumping all over the planet could really take it out of you on a physical level. 

Michelle was already up and about, rummaging through the huge black duffel she'd arranged to be on the plane. From the corner of his eye he saw gun cases, body armour... was that a grenade? 

He was almost dozing off, the low whine of the engines no deterrent to his rest, when Lillian tapped him on the shoulder. 

"There's a bed in the back, wanna' fuck?" 

Michelle snorted, a little piggy sound, and began laughing. 

"Do I get to sleep after?" he asked groggily. 

He entered her from behind, his cock squeezing between her soft thighs as they lay on their sides spooned together. She was hot and wet, squirming as he stretched her labia wide and sank deep into her nethers. They breathed together for a few moments when he was as far in as he could get, her huge ass flush against his thick root. She reached behind to run her nails soothingly through his hair, cooing for him to fuck her hard. 

He bit the back of her neck, making her curvy body arch and quiver as he took firm grip on her waspish midriff and began pounding into her. Something came over him then, a savage, desperate lust. He'd almost lost her today and now he poured the last of his energy back into her, growling as his enormous, throbbing cock shuttled deep within her spasming, juicy cunt. 

She squirted clear liquid all over his heavy balls and crotch again, ruining the shorts he'd simply pulled down for their quick romp. Her cries of ecstasy brought the co-pilot from the cockpit. Chris held onto her bucking hips with bruising force, riding the vampire hard through her gushing orgasm as her legs twitched and kicked uncontrollably. 

Magic pooled in his loins as she finally relaxed around his shaft. He was giving her everything he had left, making sure that sapping spell hadn't harmed her or their offspring. His cock hardened, thickened inside her as his cum rose. He knew she could never hold enough in her vagina, he needed her womb, but it was already occupied. The dragon provided the answer. 

He took a firm grip of her sweaty, brown ponytail as he ripped his throbbing cock out of her snatch with a gooey squelch. Speed was going to be key, already, his abdomen was starting to shudder oh-so pleasurably. Her womanhood was left gaping, round butt splattered in her own juices as he knee-walked up the bed to her head. 

She was still winded from her monumental climax, her cheeks flushed and rosy as he tugged her head upwards and pushed his huge, glistening crown against her plush red lips. She knew what he wanted. Her lips opened wide and predatory as she managed to swallow his entire knob and begin slurping. Her tongue was a flurry of licks and caresses, seeking out his copiously flowing pre-come and delving into his cock-slit. Far more than simply proficient, she coaxed him to thicken in mere seconds. 

The ponytail was excellent leverage and he tugged her onto her hands and knees to receive his load. He groaned as the first viscous, pencil-thick ropes began to fly, his body shuddering in orgasmic release, the exquisite transfer of his magic. 

Professional she might have been, but Lillian had never dealt with this sort of deluge going off inside her mouth before. She swallowed but simply couldn't keep up under the onslaught of magical pleasure his seed forced on her. Nor how sticky and thick it was in her mouth. His spunk began to seep at the corners of her lips, her cheeks bulging. Her brown eyes looked up at him in mixed apology and magical ecstasy. He could tell she was about to spit him out. 

That would not do at all, the dragon warned as he gripped her head in both hands and shoved his hips forward. He lodged his fat head at the back of her throat, choking her, and absolutely unloaded. 

Vampires do not have a gag reflex but the look of malice in her narrowed eyes said it all. First, she sulked as he pumped jet after delicious jet straight down her throat. Then, as he didn't stop, her stomach filling rapidly, she began to whimper. Her jaw was stretched so wide around his dragon-cock, but she forced herself to hold still and open as he finally finished with a tortured groan. 

She pulled off of him with a heaving gasp of breath, spittle and sticky cum trailing down onto her massive, perfect breasts. He breathed a huge sigh of relief, eager to finally get his well-deserved rest. 

"What the fuck was that?!" she snarled, spitting excess seed from her mouth and rising on her knees. 

The dragon was too tired, too sore. Didn't she know what he'd just done, he'd done for her, for their child? Her body would have to absorb his magic now. He just lay down, beckoning her to join him. 

He smiled sleepily when after a few seconds of bewilderment, she joined him, their faces almost touching as she watched him through narrowed eyes. 

"However, whenever, wherever," he reminded her of her promise as he pulled her lush body into his. 

"But it's common courte-" 

He silenced her protest with a tired, half-hearted swat to her big, soft rump. 

"Later Lillian, teach me the etiquette later, just right now... let me sleep." 

He was gone to the land of dreams moments later, leaving the cum-filled vampire to stare at his peaceful, handsome face in disbelief. Before, she might have added innocent as an adjective but after what he'd just done... well, not any more. 

She was a little concerned how her body would react to such an unusual food. In general, vampires only ate blood and very occasionally indulged in a favourite beverage such as wine or black coffee. Too much of that could upset their system though. 

She belched, his spicy cinnamon scent heavy on her breath. A contagious giggle rose in her throat, she tried to quench it, but it slipped out for a few moments before she regained control. Had she just sucked off a Devine, an enormously powerful entity of ancient times? The bedroom gloves were coming off now, little dragon.

*** 

When Michelle first mentioned Sardinia, Chris needed to look it up online. 

What astonished him, now that he had access to Michelle's burgeoning BIA database, was the sheer wealth of magical knowledge at his disposal. Her work learning, tracking, and collecting knowledge from Maginet was impressive. No doubt there were others involved in the project too, but he had no doubt she'd thrown herself into the work. He understood now why she worked so late and looked haggard at times. She was making an intelligence database of the magical world. 

Not only that, she had up-to-date intelligence from the country's military too. 

Sardinia -he'd never even heard of the place. Now he knew it was the second largest island in the Mediterranean. It had a rich and ancient culture, relied on tourism, and had a disproportionate NATO military presence. In fact, next week there was to be a test firing of some sort of top secret swarm torpedo system. 

It also had the highest concentration of merfolk in the world. None of that mattered to him right now though. They were here to hunt. 

Parked under some sort of scraggly tree in a rocky sheep pasture, their hired jeep served well enough to transport them from the airport. The leaves above rustled in a warm breeze, providing only partial shade as he watched. At least it wasn't oppressively hot. Across the valley, through the lenses of Michelle's binoculars, Patrick Riker's villa-mansion beckoned. 

Invisible in the seat behind his, the vampire kissed his neck. His observation interrupted by her teasing, breathy lips, he closed his eyes. He could tell she was smiling. Just as his neck hairs began to quiver, she latched on and sucked, pulling his blood toward his skin. She didn't bite, just lapped her saliva into his neck, quelling the swelling with her own magic. Lillian was marking him, proclaiming by virtue of her scent to all other vampires that he was hers. He smiled, allowing it. 

It appeared last night's indignity was forgiven. Perhaps putting her thighs on his shoulders and using a hybrid dragon's tongue to the tune of two body-quivering orgasms counted as an acceptable reimbursement of favours. 

"Do you want to fuck an invisible woman?" She whispered in her incredibly accented sexy-husk. "You young things call it a quickie, no?" 

"Lillian..." he breathed almost resignedly. 

"In my day we called it a 'soldier's tumble,' a roadside fuck while the column of soldiers marched. You had to be quick, so the man didn't fall behind once they were gone. I need you in me, Chris." 

"Fuck..." 

"Please?" 

Michelle snorted in disgust. 

"Would you just get it out of the way so she shuts up for half an hour?" She opened her driver's door and stepped onto the dusty, dry grass beneath. It shut a little firmly as she went to sit against the gnarled trunk with her trusty tablet. 

It must have looked absurd, had there been anyone watching. The huge young man clambering out of the ATV, a massive tent in his black fatigues. Stranger, when he dropped them frantically, rolling down on to the grass and onto his knees, a very large cock already probing at nothing before he sank forward hurriedly and began fucking the living shit out of a squealing patch of air. 

He left her gasping, a pool of semen glistening in the sunlight as it seeped from her molten, still quivering depths. Her sex was bare, slick, and obviously swollen from hard, passionate use. A vision, if only anyone were able to see her. 

"Mmmhhh. That's the first time I've fucked under the sun since I was human... delicious," she lay back, licking his blood from her lips, her tousled ponytail swishing in the dry grass. "Perhaps Vlad was onto something." 

"Where did you learn your soldier's tumble?" he asked, trying to clean his crotch with a water bottle and spare t-shirt from the jeep. 

"I was just eighteen when I followed a column to Moscow. It was a good way to get away from home." 

"Oh... Lillian I'm s..." 

"I'm fine, Chris. I have had a long time to come to terms with my human past," she couldn't help smiling at his concern. "I have you, our child, your blood... that glorious cock. I have never been happier, vampire or human." 

"You mean that?" he turned to stare where he thought her face must be. Invisible intimacy was a bit hit and miss. 

"Yes." 

"Thank you. I'm not... feedback is appreciated." 

"Your pheromones are doing things to me, young one, your magic. I love it, my inner beast is finally happy." 

They ended up joining Michelle under the old tree. Chris propped his head up on a bag of body armour from the back of the truck, found the binoculars again and relaxed. Lillian, not caring about the dust or the slightly rocky ground, wrapped herself against his side and actually slept. 

Back at his observation, the sprawling green lawns surrounding the villa looked almost garish. Against the landscape of rock and hardy shrubs, the irrigated bright green was unnatural. Below them, a well-tended olive grove swept down the face of the hill toward the road, giving the driveway a pleasant border. 

Beyond, past the main road and a few houses, a lovely, calm little beach. Through the binoculars, Chris could see people enjoying the sun and warm Mediterranean water down there. Annabel and his brood were once again missing out. Remedying the situation should be easy in theory, he would love to take them places like this. He should, but time was ever his enemy. That would have to change eventually. 

Michelle combed over what recent satellite images she'd dared collect without drawing attention to her activity. Though no one had told them specifically not to come looking for the man, in the spirit of international relations, they weren't supposed to be here. It was Lillian who'd used her connections through the vampire community to find him here in Italy. 

"There will be at least three guards on duty tonight," Michelle intoned, not looking up from her screen. "We can't see it from here but there's a compound out the back that could easily house ten or more. They must be trained well because he's paying them a lot." 

"It doesn't matter if we go in through the Ether," Chris reassured. 

"I know, we just need to be prepared and informed. Those guys could all be ex-Australian Special Forces or South African mercenaries for what we know, they cost enough." 

"The guy has that much money?" Chris wondered. 

"More." 

"The wild cards will be if he's somehow hired magic help," Lillian observed drowsily. "If he has the contacts, he could buy a few young vampires. There are likely nasty mechanisms that will get set off if he disappears. We can't have someone releasing a pile of information about Beings to the public if he doesn't make a scheduled phone call next week." 

"Our secondary objectives are his electronics and records. All going well, I should have at least 6 hours of undisturbed access." 

They whittled away the warm afternoon in companionable quiet. Conversation would occasionally spring to life but it didn't last more than a few minutes as they waited for nightfall. 

Contented vampires were like big lazy cats it seemed. Lillian and Chris lay together, embracing, lightly petting, dozing. His mind re-examined the previous night's events. In defending their child, they'd grown closer. 

House Lefayd would be gathering themselves, recovering the pieces from the blow he'd dealt. He wondered what their reaction would be, to seek retribution or recognise the just nature of his attack and move onward. He certainly hoped for the latter, he'd snuffed out thousands and thousands of years of experience and life last night. Guilt didn't enter his mind, only regret that it had happened at all. He'd been defending himself and his mate, they had forced him into that position. Perhaps he did feel guilty about the young elf whose tongue he'd removed. That had been a particularly cruel instinct to act upon. He would have to do something to remedy the situation. 

It was good to know the vampires were backing him, well, backing Lillian. 

What did it mean to have a connection to those ancient, godlike creatures? Why him? 

Lillian mumbled something unintelligible in her sleep, bumping his chin with her nose. The warm breeze wafted a few strands of her invisible hair across his face, scented subtly of honey. Those questions didn't matter for now, he realised. 

His abilities were his own, he would use them as he saw fit. Whether it was to track down corrupt billionaires in the Mediterranean, or to make new life with the lovely woman at his side, it didn't matter. Morally, he was doing okay so far. 

The Synod might not be too happy with him after last night but that wasn't exactly new. Hopefully their collective response would be aimed at Eramir. It didn't look good for any of the Being leaders when one of their own was exposed and disgraced. Once again though, he'd drawn attention to himself and his powers. If it wasn't already common speculation on Maginet, word of his connection to the ancient Devines would inevitably break. What then? 

"Chris?" Michelle asked tentatively, his eyes were closed and he was breathing deeply. 

"Yeah, what's up?" he rolled slightly away from Lillian to look up at his friend. 

Nervously, she tucked some dark hair behind her ear and looked away, toward the setting sun. 

"I ahh... God this is embarrassing." 

"What?" 

"I've been thinking about what you said. That we could... if I wanted." 

"Oh," he smiled. 

He wasn't trying to seem cock-sure, he was genuinely happy. It must have seemed that way though because her brow set in a stern frown, her eyes hardening in defence. 

"I only ask because I can't help noticing the changes some of your brood are going through," she said in the same voice she gave him briefings in. "Immi is growing, Susan has lost five pounds and looks about the same number of years younger, Annabel... well, she stops bullets now." 

Silence hung between them as he waited for her to come to the question she was searching for. 

"Would I," she closed her eyes, twitching her shoulders as if to shake something off. "Would I benefit in an equivalent way if we became intimate?" 

"I don't know," he answered openly. "It's possible but Annabel's magic comes from Bartholomew. Susan was a witch already. Why, would you like that?" 

"I mean, in my position it would be advantageous," Michelle stopped her justification and looked the dragon in the eyes. "Yes, I would like any edge I can get." 

"So, it's purely professional?" Chris teased her. "Nothing romantic in the least? I'm hurt, Michelle." 

"Stop it," she poked him. "This is hard." 

"That's what she said." 

"Oh my god, I swear you are fourteen years old." 

"Okay, okay," he relented. "Mood lightened, mission accomplished." 

She watched him meaningfully, his goofy smile, his honest blue eyes. 

"I don't want to get pregnant," she whispered. 

"Michelle, this thing between us, it can be whatever you want," he tried to explain. "I wouldn't bite you with Itch unless you wanted me to. You want the benefits you see in the rest of my brood? Well we could even try to work something out so we didn't need to have sex." 

"No," she stopped him. "No, I ah... I'm not against the sex. I just... I've never been in a committed relationship." 

"What, no boyfriends? Nothing?" 

"Not really," she admitted, flushing heavily in the low light. "I'm sort of terrible at that stuff." 

"Huh," Chris mused. "I never would have thought so. You're lovely." 

"Stop it." 

"I'm serious. You're amazing, driven, scarily smart, beautiful. What's not to like?" 

"I think it doesn't help that I run an NSA background check on anyone before going on a date," she admitted. 

"Professional prudence," he nodded sagely even as his eyes twinkled with mischief. "I mean it though, our relationship can be whatever you want. You're already my Familiar and part of our little family. If you want to exploit me for magical powers on the side, that's okay. No commitments necessary." 

"Thanks." 

She smiled at him tentatively, but he returned his best lecherous grin. She guffawed quietly, pushing his bulk back over onto Lillian. He chuckled even as her hand trailed up his neck into his hair to rest there, intimate. 

He relaxed against Lillian, enjoying the last of their restful day as the sun slunk low and red over the rocky hills. The vampire shifted subtly and began whispering with just her lips. She was not nearly as asleep as he'd assumed. Her voice was so quiet he knew only his ears would pick it up, still he sensed the lyrical rhythm of her words. 

"... and another one gone, and another one gone. Another one bites the dust." 

He shut her up with a kiss. 

*** 

Their phase-hopping journey across the shallow valley was a desolate experience. He'd grown accustomed to the growth that seemed to sprout in his presence. There was nothing here. Only a tingle at the back of his neck, an uneasiness he couldn't readily place. He chalked it up to nerves, they were breaking into a mansion full of evil henchmen after all. 

It felt almost like cheating to skim through the Ether past watchful perimeter guards. Even walls were no barrier, Lillian's hand in his right, Michelle's in his left. Together, they pushed through the mild resistance of stucco and into the four bay garage. 

"Look at these cars!" Michelle hissed. "Oh man, I wish we could borrow one." 

"Are they nice?" Chris asked quietly, clueless about the colourless outlines of the sleek sports vehicles. 

"Very nice," even Lillian was impressed. "The far one is a Ferrari GT Lusso, I think. Classy." 

Chris grunted, pulling them onward into the building. 

"I didn't think you two, of all people, would be into cars." 

"It's okay to admire," Michelle defended as they pushed through an ornate hardwood door into a grand hallway. "I know I'll never own anything like those, but it's fun to dream." 

"Mmm, don't be jealous, young one," Lillian purred, her breasts brushing against his arm with every step. "You don't need luxury vehicles to prove your manhood, do you?" 

"Huh," he grunted. "I'll need a fucking people mover and a fortune's worth of car seats in about seven months." 

"Yes, my love." 

"Shh," Michelle warned. "There's another guard." 

"They can't hear us," Chris reassured her for about the fourth time of the night. 

"I know... it's just. It makes me feel better if we're quiet, okay? I know it's illogical." 

"It's okay," he squeezed her hand reassuringly, stopping her owl-like peering into the ghostly gloom. 

Chris watched the insubstantial outline of the large man as he continued obliviously on his patrol. He passed no less than two metres away, a submachine gun hanging from the tactical webbing on his chest. Michelle had been right about their need to avoid a firefight with this guy and his friends. 

"The server room should be just around the corner over there," Michelle pointed into a huge lounge room complete with home theatre. "We should plant my access point now, so we don't have to come back." 

"Fair enough," Chris nodded. "It will be easier now than with an uncooperative prisoner." 

The polished hardwood floors they glided noiselessly across must have looked lovely in the Norm. Chris had only recently signed away a huge sum for wooden flooring in his own house so he could appreciate the effort and expense put into this extravagant hideaway. 

"Here?" He stopped in front of the first door they came across. It was rather nondescript but there was a security camera covering it from across the room. 

"I think so," Michelle said. 

Through the door they pushed. 

"Jackpot," she dropped his hand, moving forward to hover over the equipment. 

"This isn't very fun," Lillian pouted as she took in the modest, orderly space. "I thought there would be more screaming." 

"I'm sorry our adventure doesn't live up to your standards," Chris chuckled. "Perhaps when we interrogate our errant billionaire, you can get your screaming fix." 

Chris hovered over Michelle's shoulder, watching as she unpacked five large, black flash drives from a foam-filled waterproof case. One for each machine, he assumed. There wasn't that much computer gear really, but for a personal residence, the three small servers and two high-powered desktop workspaces were overkill. 

"Are you confident you can help me do it from the Ether?" She asked. 

"Confident might not be the best word," he admitted. "Cautiously optimistic seems more honest." 

She paused, looking up at the cameras on either side of the room. 

"It's worth a try. We need access." 

Together, they pushed through desks, screens, chairs, and walls, delicately manoeuvring to the rear of the first device. 

Carefully, Michelle slotted a fully-fledged stick into a ghostly rear USB slot. Chris tried to focus his intention on the Ether-image of the target computer, commanding it to extra firmness. It was an unnatural, strange resistance, taxing his magic more than he'd expected. Still, Michelle needed some tactile feedback to correctly insert the sticks and Chris wasn't sure how the two sets of inanimate matter would interact without his magical guidance. It wouldn't be good if the little drives fell through the ghost-images as soon as they were released, shredding the rear panel of the computer in the process. There was still a lot to learn about the Ether. 

When Michelle was done double checking the placement, she tentatively released the drive. They both tensed, waiting for some sort of alarm to go off or the drive to disappear altogether. Nothing, it clung onto the back of the computer, still under Chris' influence. Finally, he willed the flash stick back into the Norm. 

They breathed a collective sigh of relief as nothing disastrous happened. 

"Next?" he asked. 

"Yeah, let's do the rest and move on, we won't know if they're working until I can fire up the tablet and attempt a connection." 

They finished in short order, becoming more confident with every successful installation. In the end, it was an uneventful process under the guide of Chris' magic. With any luck, Michelle could now begin the process of remotely tapping in and mining data. As the machines also recorded and stored all the camera feeds around the mansion, they might get to watch the reaction to Riker's disappearance and respond as necessary. 

They made their silent, other-dimensional way upstairs. One guard sat quietly in the darkness, watching the stairwell. He proved as ineffective a deterrent as the rest. 

One final wall later, they were inside the master bedroom. On a modest queen bed, amidst a tangle of kicked blankets, a middle-aged man snored softly. He looked peaceful in his blue silk pyjamas, his full head of greying hair tousled against a plush pillow. 

"It's him," Michelle said as they stood over him like vengeful wraiths. "Help me look for his things." 

Without another word, they spread around the room, poking their noses into every nook, wall, cranny, drawer, and cupboard. Michelle was very pleased with their booty. Not only did they come away with his personal computer, wallet, phone, and briefcase; they also found four passports in his name and a respectable stash of around forty thousand Euros. It all went into a big duffel bag Michelle had forced upon Lillian for this exact reason. 

Happy with their effort, the gathered back at the side of the bed. 

"Everyone ready?" Chris asked. "There's no going back after we grab him." 

"He deserves worse," Lillian said venomously. 

"It's the right thing to do," Michelle nodded more reservedly. 

They formed a chain, Chris holding Michelle's hand, who held Lillian's hand, leaving Chris free to bring them softly out of the Ether and firmly grip Patrick Riker by the elbow. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 16|
--------------------------------------------
They were back in the Ether before the man even had the sense to cry out. By then it was too late, he only managed to catch a glimpse of three accusing faces and a terrible world of shadows before he was ripped away into momentary nothingness. For a few brief moments, it must have seemed like a dream. 

With a strangled gasp, Patrick blinked his sleepy eyes open, adrenaline pounding through his system. There was grass and rock under his soft bare feet. Someone had him by the elbow, a crushing grip. He turned in the moonlight, about to protest the treatment but the man beat him to it with a deep angry growl. 

"Good evening Mr. Riker. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Christopher Baryst, perhaps you've heard of me." 

"I don't... what's... oh god," the man's befuddled stammering was cut short as by moonlight, he watched the huge, dark shape of his kidnapper sprout a pair of wings. The creature cocked its head, that his prey might get a good look at him. 

"You paid good money to have me kidnapped and experimented on," Chris smiled, displaying a beautifully deadly white maw. "It's time to pay the bill. Lillian, if you would." 

A tall beauty stepped from behind the dragon, several sturdy cable ties in her fingers. 

"Now look here!" he called up a little of his boardroom bluster. "I... ggguuuuunhh." 

The air left his lungs in a rush, the blow sprawling him onto the dirt, ruining his best pyjamas. He gagged, gulping quietly, cradling whatever was left of his spleen. 

The woman was leaning over him, grabbing his arm and rolling him painfully onto his front. 

"Stop," he croaked hoarsely. 

She struck him in the back. This time he passed out for a few seconds, the world going quiet and blissfully painless, if only for a moment. He wanted to scream, to rage, to fight against this injustice, this assault against him. His body failed him, going limp and submissive as his arms were bound together, his legs shackled in plastic. Worse, he knew he'd brought this all upon himself. 

"You speak when spoken to, Rat," the woman leaned over and licked the cold sweat forming on the back of his neck. "Or I'll keep hitting you until you stop squeaking." 

Chris turned away from Lillian's 'softening,' he didn't have the stomach for it right now. Michelle was setting up their little blackout tent, her tablet and Patrick's laptop were already booting up on the driver's seat of the jeep. 

That nervous, wary feeling was back. He scanned the darkness around the edge of the sheep pasture. Nothing. Still, he couldn't shake the sensation. His ears were pricked, his flattened, hybrid snout scenting for danger. Even his forked tongue slipped out to taste the air for peril. 

Unconvinced either way by his senses, he decided to go help Michelle but stopped dead still after two paces. A pair of huge yellow eyes blinked at him from the lower boughs of their moonlit shade tree. 

Chris froze, ready for an attack. He couldn't resolve the shape of the figure crouched in the foliage, only those owl-like eyes. As he stood there, wondered if it might simply be an owl. Then, with a quiet flap of leathery wings, those enchanting eyes slithered out of the tree to stand before him. 

Lillian turned with a hiss, startled by the nearby noise and the breeze of wingbeats. Things did not usually sneak up on her. 

She found her dragon face to face with a gargoyle. 

"Ahh.. Hi?" Chris asked, unwilling to let the silence last. 

It was clear now why she'd been impossible to see. Her skin was a deep, charcoal grey. Darker patterns, tattoo-like, mottled almost every inch of her skin, making a confusing pattern to the eyes. Only her large, vertically slitted yellow eyes and the tiny white horns growing from just above her temples were readily visible in the night, even to his dragon's vision. There was no doubt she was female though. Camouflage couldn't hide her athletic, womanly shape or the lighter grey buds of her small, bared nipples. 

"Hello, I'm Chris," he tried again, smiling down at the unusual woman and extending his hand. 

"Be careful," Lillian whispered as she slunk into position behind him, her prisoner left to recover for a moment. "She must be quite old to have such horns." 

"She's a gargoyle, right?" Chris asked, watching as the woman assessed his outstretched hand cautiously. Finally, she stepped forward and grasped it in both of her own, bringing their bodies close. 

"Wait Lillian," he pre-empted his lover's attack as the gargoyle began to trace his fingers with her own, feeling his hand all over. "She seems friendly." 

Something dark slithered around his calf, wrapping softly around the muscle. Chris jumped at the alien sensation, almost stumbled over himself in fright. He'd been so absorbed in those eyes. 

"Oh! Hello..." He frowned, looking down to see an inch-thick prehensile charcoal tail squeezing his pants softly. It ended in a cute little heart shaped bud which suddenly flipped over and stared right back at him with a third yellow eye. "What the..." 

"Nyx," the woman finally spoke, a sharp-toothed white smile of her own brightening her dark face. 

"Nyx?" Chris met her eyes again, almost thankful to have an excuse to look away from her unnerving tail. "That's your name? I'm Chris." 

"Nyx... Dr... Dra... Dragnon," she stumbled in a thick accent, pointing at herself and Chris in turn. 

"Yes," he smiled back. "I'm a dragon. You don't speak English, huh?" 

Lillian stepped around Chris' big purple wing, right in the gargoyle's face. The two women looked each other up and down in obvious assessment. Eventually, Nyx bobbed her head in deference, her tail slid gently off his leg. 

The woman squeezed his hand almost imploringly and began an animated spiel in a language he'd never heard. He looked to Lillian, who frowned in concentration as she listened. The gargoyle kept squeezing his hand and gesticulating with her other, even pointing at what he suspected was Lillian's tummy. 

"What the fuck is going on?" Michelle emerged with her dimmed flashlight from the small interrogation ready bubble she was setting up. "Did someone have an epiphany and start speaking in toung... oh, fuck." 

Michelle's hand fumbled straight for the pistol on her hip. 

"Don't," Chris' voice rose in command, stopping Nyx's monologue. 

Lillian quickly took the gargoyle's attention back, motioning she should continue. 

They all waited in silence until the grey, winged woman stopped talking. 

"You people are fucking bat-shit crazy!" Patrick moaned from the ground. 

Lillian vanished from his side, a dull thump and a muffled squawk later, and she was back. 

Nyx had eyes only for the hybrid dragon. In the low light of Michelle's filtered flashlight, he caught a glimpse of the woman's muscled perfection. He could swear there was barely an ounce of fat on the dark woman. She looked almost like something out of a bodybuilder's magazine and she was apparently not ashamed to show the world. For the first time, he wondered how things would go if this got violent, gargoyles were supposed to be very tough and almost immune to magic. 

"She speaks some sort of ancient Greek," Lillian said. "I'm not sure. I think I got about forty percent, I'm rusty." 

"That's amazing Lillian, what did she say?" Chris asked, genuinely impressed with her lingual skill. He'd never learned another language, he didn't think he would be smart or dedicated enough to manage it. 

"I think she tried to introduce herself," Lillian started slowly as Nyx bobbed impatiently, apparently a little frustrated that her story wasn't spilling fluidly from the vampire's lips. "I missed a lot of that part but she's old, Chris. Really old. She mentioned the Elf wars and they were almost twenty-five hundred years ago. I think she was some sort of soldier. She kept saying something about sleeping." 

"No way, that's older than Reyla. What does she want?" 

"Idiot," Lillian poked him. "What do you think she wants, all meek and doe-eyed. She is a fierce, ancient, and very deadly creature. We are uninvited in the midst of her territory. It's a good thing she likes you too, I got the feeling she's run others away." 

"Oh," Chris looked down at Nyx. "I ah... Look, I'm sorry Nyx, but we just met. I'll be honest the language barrier is going to be a little difficult to overcome." 

She might not have been able to understand his words but his tone made his decision clear enough. She dropped his hand, turned on her heal and was about to launch herself into the air when Chris reached out to stop her, touching the edge of her wing. 

She rounded on him like lightning, delivering a ringing slap to his cheek. Thankfully it hadn't been a blow meant to hurt but it was very dramatic. He stood stunned for a moment, gathering his wits. 

"Fuck... Jesus, I've never been slapped before. Lillian, I was going to try to tell her she can visit us in Denver if she wants to talk about it more. I'm not going to mate with her on the spot. Can you please try telling her that?" 

Lillian mashed a few halting words together, stopped and tried again. Chris rubbed his smarting cheek, smiling ruefully at the scowling gargoyle. He supposed he'd deserved it, rejecting a woman and then touching her without permission. 

"It's not working, sorry. My Greek isn't nearly good enough for that." 

"It's okay," Chris shrugged. "We tried." 

"Try simplifying the message to something you can communicate," Michelle suggested from the jeep before turning and getting back to her preparation. Their prisoner wasn't going to interrogate himself and neither were his computer systems. 

"Hmm, it's going to have to be pretty basic," Lillian mused. One of her eyebrows arched in cold calculation. "That might work." 

She spoke a single short word to the frozen gargoyle, but her countenance brightened rapidly. 

"What did you say?" Chris looked to Lillian in worry at the sudden swing of mood. 

"Well, I tried to say visit, I think it came out more as follow. Not too sure." 

"We're not taking her back with us." 

"I know," Lillian grinned evilly. 

"So..." 

"She's happy for now. Then, we leave." 

"We leave her behind with no knowledge of where we live or how to find us," Chris scowled at his lover. "That's not really..." 

"It's the best I can do, dear," Lillian said sweetly and turned back to the snivelling billionaire. She began dragging the man toward Michelle's tent. 

That night, Chris learned what truth syrup could do to a man in the hands of two experienced interrogators. He sat on the bonnet of the jeep with a naked gargoyle while Michelle and Lillian wrung him out for every drop of information they could sponge up. Passwords, bank accounts, contacts, networks, they got everything. 

It painted a far grimmer picture than they'd imagined. Patrick Riker was by no means the only human trying to capitalize on the Revelation. He'd been tipped off by someone in the military and he knew of other interests who'd bought similar information. Key members of his powerful family now knew as well, allowing them to organize their assets accordingly to best serve their interests. Indeed, among the truly elite of society, the existence of Beings was becoming common knowledge. 

Chris sat in silence with a tentatively affectionate Nyx, listening to the man explain that there were already ways to purchase from the Being underworld. Information, spells, even magical muscle. 

That was how he'd been kidnapping Beings. He'd simply bought the names, types, classes, and locations through an intermediary for a steep price. 

Money. It was insulting that just money almost bought his kidnapping and almost killed Lillian. There was no great cause, no misguided sense of justice. Just money and greed. It was eye opening. So was the sheer wealth of the man, who found it easy to rattle off a list of his top assets at Michelle's command. 

"Why did you do it?" Michelle finally asked the groggy, emotionally unfiltered man. 

"Why?!" It sounded almost like he didn't understand the question. "I... Because I can? It's a huge opportunity. Too good to waste the chance of getting ahead." 

So it had simply been for this man's desire for more money that he'd had to step into danger's path, get knocked out, poisoned, and spend a week in hospital? A cold, dark, little spark of rage began crackling in the pit of his stomach. Nyx shuffled nervously next to him, reaching up to touch his cheek. 

"No, no," he reassured her, holding her calloused hand to his skin. "Not Nyx. Him. He's a bad man." 

"Bad, maan?" she asked quietly when next Patrick spoke. 

"Yes," Chris smiled, impressed with her grasp. Her willingness to stick with him in such an uncertain situation was surprisingly endearing, if a little creepy. "He's been hurting people and we're here to deal with him." 

Lillian took over for a while as Michelle used what she'd learned to crack open his personal computer and begin verifying what she could. 

The vampire asked specifically about how he'd contacted Beings, who had sold him the information, how it had been delivered, anything. On this, the non-human front, Patrick was unfortunately dry of actionable information. Her questioning did reveal that he had indeed taken steps to blackmail his life and freedom against the secret of the Revelation. Two different family lawyers back in the States had instructions to release information to the press if he were ever discovered dead or went missing. 

Chris understood the appeal of the memory alteration charm now, even the necessity. Barbaric as it might seem, being able to use the charm now could have saved the man's life. Could have, because he had a feeling Lillian was out for blood anyway at this point. 

He couldn't blame her. By his own admission, the man was a greed-twisted monster, buying people to commit the worst crimes in his stead. Murder, kidnap, intimidation, property destruction, tax evasion in the extreme, the list went on. How easy, how tidy it would be to cast a spell and remove all memory of the events from his mind, from the minds of his accomplices. Now they would have to kill him. 

The man knew it, too. He was distraught under the influence of the truth-forcing syrup. The loss of control for someone so assured of their superior place in the world must have been traumatizing. All his life, money had saved him. He tried now, offering obscene bribes for his life. But when it became obvious that it only offended the vampire, he dissolved into unreserved begging, pleading. 

"Do you have any more questions?" Lillian asked disdainfully. 

"No," Michelle looked up from her work on his computer. "I'm cleaning house here." 

"Chris?" 

"No," he answered, his voice almost failing him. He was too ashamed to face the man in his final moments. 

Patrick Riker's last seconds were wasted with a piteous wailing. He never felt a thing as the vampire broke his neck with a soft crunch. 

Nyx sat close beside him, casually tracing the contours of his forearm as he shook. It didn't seem to concern the woman at all, she bumped her head into his shoulder with catlike affection. Was this what he'd become, a calculating killer? 

"That was better than you deserved," Lillian spat inside the tent. 

"Agreed," Michelle said with satisfaction. "He deserved to rot in prison for several lifetimes. His money won't buy him freedom this time. Chris?" 

"Yeah, I just, I wish we didn't have to." 

"If not us, who?" Lillian asked. "We came here tonight to cut out a little weed and instead learned that our garden is infested with them. Our work is just beginning." 

"You're right," Chris admitted. "I know. I guess they shouldn't have made me worship vigilantes as a kid if they didn't want us taking things into our own hands." 

Michelle unzipped the tent and came to stand before him in the spewing light. 

"These people don't play by society's rules. In their world, might is right. Through you, we have the power to reach out and do something about it. People like him are right now poisoning any chance of the Revelation with their own greedy schemes. The world is a better place with one less Patrick Riker." 

"I know." 

She took a step up onto the bumper and kissed his purple forehead. 

"But I like that taking a life isn't meaningless to you. Don't lose that, Chris." 

He followed her back into the tent and pulled Patrick Riker's corpse into the Ether. With a firm tug, he sunk through the ground, swimming through the jelly-like ethereal shadows of soil, rock, and root. He left him there to decompose, to feed their shade tree or any of the tiny Ether denizens who took care of such detritus. 

They were subdued as they packed up their little camp by moonlight. No congratulations or talk of success. The discovery of a larger problem robbed them of catharsis. 

Several hours of driving took them out of the immediate area. Lillian practically entwined herself with Chris' large, now human body and their pile of equipment in the back seat. Michelle drove doggedly, fighting fatigue. 

Nyx sat up front, her wings folded primly behind her. From the gargoyle's excited exclamations, Chris had to wonder if she'd been in a car before. 

It was obvious she didn't understand what was coming and guilt rose in him. While he wasn't looking forward to their unceremonious goodbye, what choice did he have? 

The jeep was left abandoned on the outskirts of a large village. Someone would find it, keys in the ignition. From there, its fate would not be in their hands. 

They hauled their equipment a little way, underneath the broad leaves of a fig orchard. Michelle and Lillian exchanged a telling look and took up position on either side of Chris, taking all but his backpack from him so they could each hold his hand. Nyx stood a few paces off, her head cocked in curiosity as she looked around the plantation. 

Chris let his magic free, flowing out over Lillian and Michelle, over their equipment. Nyx turned sharply to him, her lips making the cutest little 'o' of surprise before they vanished. 

The gargoyle's anger eventually faded with her need to find shelter before dawn. She flapped almost silently to a nearby rocky hillside, taking perch on top of a huge boulder. As she settled in for the day, her magic worked around her, concealing her to appear as a perfectly natural outcropping. She spread her wings wide this morning, more surface area to absorb when the stone-skin came. Strength would be vital.

"Hold it steady!" Kat lifted his earmuff and practically screamed at him. 

"I can't, they're shaking," he put the heavy pistol he was trying to aim down on the bench in frustration. He held his trembling hands up for his taskmistress to see. His big mitts were visibly quivering. 

"Clear that weapon!" she screeched in glee, pouncing on his mistake. "You're in my world now, dragon. You will God damn remember the safety protocol for this firearm or I will..." 

"Give him a break," Samantha opened the door and slid into the booth as Chris hastened to disarm the pistol he'd just laid on the bench. At least the barrel was pointed down range and the safety was on. "This isn't the Marine Corps you know, Katherine." 

"But if it was, this sorry little boot-bitch would be skuzzing the floor all night for such a piss poor performance!" she continued joyfully, ignoring the warning use of her full name. 

The older woman looked around at the brass littering the floor, the empty ammunition boxes, and the large H&amp;K pistol. She shook her head disappointedly, clearly Kat wasn't the most understanding or thoughtful teacher, which was important to know. 

"And I suppose you learned to shoot with a .45? You put one hundred and fifty rounds down range on your first day, too?" 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 17|
--------------------------------------------
"Well, no... but he can handle the .45, look at the size of his hands. He's just a soft motherfucker." 

"That's enough!" Sam said firmly and loudly in order for her tone to carry through everyone's hearing protection. Her eyes narrowed, looking scathingly at the younger woman as she spoke. "Chris, I'm sorry you've had such a rude introduction to the pistol. I just hope this experience hasn't put you off." 

"I'll be okay," Chris assured her, trying to diffuse the escalating situation. "I think I've had enough for today though." 

"Good, come with me then. There's someone who wants to meet you, we're going to get ice cream." 

Sam beckoned him to step down from the shooting bench. 

"Bye, Kat, thanks," Chris shrugged apologetically. "Ice cream always wins." 

"But he still has to learn to clean and strip the weapon," Kat was more perplexed now than anything else. 

"God damnit, Kat," Sam rounded on her again and unloaded. "Clean it yourself, you've done enough for one day. If I left him with you, I wouldn't be surprised if you had him here all night trying to strip it blindfolded!" 

Sam didn't wait to hear a response, instead bustling Chris away down the hallway. 

"Blindfolds are the third day," Kat shrugged to herself and began collecting loose brass off the floor. 

"I'm really sorry you had to go through that," Sam said as they mounted the stairs out of the small, four-lane underground range in the basement of the BIA garage. "I would have stayed around but I needed to pick up Amy from school." 

"It's fine," he insisted. "Kat's not the world's best teacher, but I was enjoying it until my hand started falling to pieces." 

"The .45 has far too much recoil for a beginner...Fucking marines." 

"Sam, it's fine. Let it go. Kat and I are both learning in a way. Hey, I've heard of an amazing ice cream place in the Being district. It's only a few minutes' walk." 

They were almost at the lobby now and Sam paused on a landing, taking a deep, relaxing breath. She visibly let her anger flow away from her. A few strands of her black hair had escaped her braid, tickling the dusky skin of her flushed neck. She swept them behind her ear, opening her eyes to reveal the calm, professional woman once again. 

"Thanks," she nodded to him and continued on up the stairs, composure restored. 

The BIA building was a rapidly evolving creature. Case in point, the refurbished lobby now had a reinforced front end, a security checkpoint complete with metal and explosives detectors, stations for four or five security staff, cameras, and according to Michelle, a crowd control panic button. Today however, there were only two guards on duty. Chris was pretty sure one guy's name was Grady, he wasn't sure about the other. They both had that competent look about them which screamed 'don't fuck with me.' 

His attention was quickly drawn to the smallest occupant of the lobby, a young girl seated on a bench next to a huge potted plant. Her feet dangled, kicking restlessly whilst her nose was buried in a book. 

"Amy," Sam's countenance beamed with pride as she beckoned her daughter over. "Come meet Mommy's... work friend." 

Amy looked up, carefully bookmarked her place, and shyly shuffled to her mother's side. 

"Amy, this is Chris Baryst. Chris, meet Amy Patel, my little bookworm," Sam petted her daughter's hair. 

Chris slowly crouched, extending his huge hand for the girl to shake. 

"Hi Amy, it's lovely to meet you." 

"You're big." 

"Amy!" Susan's admonishing was drown out in the dragon's deep, happy laughter. 

"And you're small," he chuckled, employing his best winning smile. "Did you consider that?" 

"Yes," she smiled tentatively and put her tiny hand in his. They shook. 

"What are you reading?" he asked, releasing her hand but staying balanced in a low crouch. He looked up to Sam to make sure he was doing okay. The woman was smiling like a crazy person. 

"The Hobbit," Amy held her book up. "I'm almost finished." 

Chris barely managed to contain his laughter this time. Samantha shrugged almost playfully and he knew she'd played a part in her daughter's reading. 

"Last night we read about Smaug and his great hoard of treasure," Sam took her daughter's hand. "But not all dragons are greedy and wicked, isn't that right, Chris." 

"Exactly," he spoke with authority. "In fact, I know of several who are simply delightful. Hey now, your Mom promised me ice cream. Should we go?" 

"Yeah!" Amy agreed wholeheartedly with a manic bouncing. "Ice cream, ice cream." 

"Well, okay then," Sam allowed. "I'm very proud of you for doing so well in your first week at the new school, Amy. You deserve a treat." 

They donned coats against the chill autumn wind and departed on their quest. Chris led the way and with only a small detour into the Compound's network of underground tunnels, they emerged near the shop Annabel had so highly recommended. 

"It must be good if it's busy on a cold day like today," Sam commented as six customers exited just before them. 

They entered the warm interior to the happy tinkling of a small brace of bells attached to the door. Chris had to wait a few moments to enter himself as Amy stopped in the doorway, mesmerised by the fanciful interior of pink, gold, and white. It looked like a confectionary wonderland. Chairs made of candy canes, tables that looked like lollipops, even the floor was artfully painted to look like you were walking on clouds. The place was a Wonka fantasy brought to life. 

Amy's brown eyes bugged out as they walked past the long display of ice-cream tubs and another of delicious handmade confectionary and chocolates. 

They were just choosing a booth near the back when, with an excited shriek, the door behind the counter burst open and a blond woman in a hair net and apron came bustling over to them. Chris didn't have to be introduced to recognise the woman's features or her scent. This must be Hailey's mother. 

Without further ado, he was swept into a rather breasty hug by the excited werebison. 

"Janet, I presume?" Chris laughed, squeezing her back. "I'm sorry we haven't officially met before now. I'm dating your daughter by the way." 

"I know that, silly," she tutted, releasing him reluctantly. "I'm just excited you're in my store! I was starting to think Hailey was trying to hide you from me." 

"I'm sure she's got her reasons," Chris joked cheekily, making the slightly plump blonde blush. "Janet Sibon, I'd like you to meet Samantha and Amy Patel. They've just moved down from Oregon and Sam works with me at the... new agency." 

"Oh, well, welcome to Denver," the werebison said kindly. "Please, have whatever you like today on the house. Any friend of this big hunk is a friend of mine." 

"That's very generous, thank you, Janet," Sam smiled. "What do you say, Amy?" 

"Thank you, Miss. Your store is very pretty." 

"Oh, aren't you a sweet little buttercup," Janet fussed. "Okay well, I won't keep you. Chris, you don't be a stranger now, ya' hear? I'll send out something special just for you in a minute." 

They took their seats and were immediately served by a pair of very attentive young ladies. One of them almost shoved her peer into the counter to be the first to their table. Chris wasn't sure what brand of Being they were, he didn't recognise their scent. 

"Is it always like this when you go somewhere?" Sam asked with a frown once their orders were placed. 

"Sort of," Chris shrugged. "Depends on the crowd." 

"That must be tedious." 

"Like what, Mommy?" Amy asked. 

"Oh, don't worry dear. Chris is sort of like a local hero and people treat him differently sometimes." 

"Like free ice cream?" 

"Exactly," Sam laughed as her daughter's innocent remark struck the nail on the head. 

"Then I want to be a hero when I grow up," Amy stated with supreme finality. 

"I'm sure you will be," Chris smiled at the little cherub. 

Annabel's glowing praise did not do the place justice. Chris couldn't comment on Amy or Sam's experience other than to say that they seemed to devour their treats with a chorus of delighted coos and long periods of busy silence. Amy had a 'junior chocolate float,' a small scoop of hazelnut ice cream swimming in a steaming little mug of real, decadent hot chocolate. A 12 flavour tasting palate was Sam's choice and she exclaimed with just about every new mouthful. 

The first taste of Chris' golden coloured ice cream had his mouth in ecstasy. Subtle vanilla exploded from tiny black beads, a sinfully creamy texture melted across his tongue. It was the understated perfection of the classic flavour, balanced with delicate, almost nutty sweetness and a hint of magic. Hailey's mother had just fed him something prepared with her very own milk. 

They left the warmth reluctantly, Amy clutching the small pouch of chocolates Chris had helped her pick out. The wind had picked up as well as the foot traffic as the end of the business day approached. Chris offered Amy a shoulder ride and to Sam's surprise, the usually shy girl accepted with glee. She rode high above the people rushing home from work, a little black-haired empress on a mighty dragon. 

They were almost back at the BIA building when both their phones exploded into frantic bleeping. 

"Something big is happening," Sam said as Chris held onto Amy's legs and tried to look over her shoulder. "Michelle wants everyone in the office ASAP." 

"Good thing we're just around the corner," Chris said. "I wonder what's gone wrong." 

*** 

"We're going to Brazil," Michelle tapped away at her keyboard and a satellite photograph came to life on the briefing room projector screen. Two enormous rivers merged in a sea of green jungle, a city clinging to the northern shore. "Manaus to be more exact. Something happened there a few hours ago during a congregation in one of the outlying settlements." 

"Something?" Pamela asked, looking around the room to see if anyone else thought this was a little preposterous. 

"It looks like a ritual killing, more than one hundred bodies on the ground." 

"Oh, my god," Sam's hand came to her mouth in shock and disgust. 

Chris' hand hovered awkwardly over her shoulder before settling gently. 

"What do we know?" he asked. 

"Not a lot so far," Michelle admitted. "They've been very reluctant when I've asked for photographs. They were that spooked that the area has been evacuated and sealed off. Reyla confirmed with the Synod that a large magical spike was triangulated to that position though." 

"A sacrifice?" Lisa's voice held a tiny quiver of doubt. 

"We don't know, sorry, Lisa. Anyway, word of the mass killing got to someone high-up enough that they knew about Beings. And they promptly shat their pants. No one knew what to do so they asked us to rush down there and help them investigate. It's a big step considering the Brazilians haven't been our fans since we got caught spying on their president's personal communications a few years ago." 

"If it's a magical incident, why didn't they consult the Rio territory leader?" Lillian asked. 

"Things haven't been going so well down there between the government and local Beings," Michelle admitted. 

"The Beings are a particularly cagey lot down there," Lillian nodded thoughtfully. "It tends to happen after hundreds of years under the Catholic Church." 

"That and in the initial contact with the government a few months ago, they were treated like a second-rate minority group." 

"Are we going to step on anyone's magic little toes if we storm into the Amazon on the government's say so?" Lisa asked. "No magical pygmy tribe or anaconda goddess?" 

"I sure hope not," Kat laughed. "Jungle and sun, just what I need. This city is turning nasty and it ain't even winter yet." 

"Pack your bikini's then," Michelle smiled at the eager ex-marine. "And by that, I mean full tac gear. We'll have an escort but I'm driving a hard bargain to keep our diplomatic immunity in case we have to shoot someone in self-defence. Understandably, they're a little reluctant to have us wandering around with assault rifles but we simply won't go unarmed. I made the point that we're bringing the equivalent of a magical nuclear weapon anyway, so they're thinking it can't hurt too much to have us armed. Worst case, we'll be pistols only. We'll try to leave in two hours." 

"Suits me," Lisa grinned at Pamela. 

The freckled blonde frowned at the dig. Both women were expert marksman in their own right but they'd been having a friendly argument over the last few days. It was the classic 'if there were only one,' scenario but with guns. Lisa of course, would choose a pistol. Pamela, a simple .308 scout rifle. 

"I can't go," Lillian shrugged. "Not unless you plan to be back by tomorrow noon. I've finally pinned down a meeting between some of the pricklier vampires in the west and midwest territories. I can't pull out on that." 

"Yeah, I thought that might be the case," Michelle nodded. "What do you think, Chris? Are you ready to be our only magical backup on this one?" 

"I ah..." he looked around the room, unsure. He looked to Lillian at his side. 

"Get those god-damn training wheels off," Kat poked him in the ribs from behind. "She ain't your momma." 

"Alright, alright," he chuckled as Kat kept poking him. She did have a point, he needed to venture out from under Lillian's wing at some stage. 

"Sam, you need to find someone to look after Amy for a few days," Michelle moved along to the next issue with oiled precision. 

"What?!" Sam asked, this whole time she'd simply assumed she would stay behind. "How am I supposed to find someone in a new city on two hours' notice? I've barely been here two weeks." 

"We need your investigative skills, Sam. You're the only one of us who's got experience in forensics." 

"You should ask Petra and Claire," Lisa prompted Chris. "They're really nice people, Sam." 

"They're dragons and I barely know them, Amy not at all!" Sam almost jumped down Lisa's throat before getting a hold of herself. "Sorry, Chris, I didn't mean it like that." 

"It's okay, Sam, she's your daughter," he gave her a little smile. "Hey, why don't I give them a call? We've still got a few hours before we have to leave, they could come down here and you can introduce Amy to them. You four can go have dinner with Annabel and Susan to see if it's a match. This situation is going to keep coming up until you find a solution." 

"Chris is right, you need to find someone you're happy for Amy to stay with from time to time. We need you. Michelle's Angels, remember?" Lisa offered to show there were no hard feelings for Sam snapping at her. 

"Okay," Sam murmured. 

"Michelle's Angels!" Kat whooped, racing out of the room to get the best pick from the armoury. 

Pamela followed a few seconds later, more sedately but in no less of a hurry to beat the marine to the good stuff. 

"I just..." Sam put her head in her hands and let out a little sob. "Ever since her dad died I find it so hard to leave her." 

Lisa shuffled a few seats over and gave her a hug while Chris wondered what was appropriate for him to do other than sit there awkwardly. 

"Ahh, motherhood," Lillian purred in his ear, making him sit up straight as a rod as her telekinetic power began to play teasingly across his thigh. "Never thought I'd be on that particular roller-coaster ride. Hmmm. Just don't make any more of our 'angels' into mothers while you're away, okay youngling?" 

Chris' resulting blush would be a cherished memory for the vampire in their days apart. 

*** 

The jungle assaulted them as soon as the cabin door of the jet unsealed. Heat and humidity washed over him like a wave, making his skin tingle and sweat dew almost instantly. There was an earthy, foreign scent to the air which didn't sit right in his nose. It was too pungent, too thick, and much too wet. For a young man from Laramie, Wyoming stepping into the Amazon was a shock to his entire body. 

Their escort was already arrayed and waiting for them on the tarmac. Two big ural trucks full of men in green fatigues, old FN FAL rifles slung over their shoulders and floppy camouflage hats on their heads. Three high-end black SUVs beckoned them, promising blessed air-conditioning in the 95-degree heat. 

A tall, very thin man stepped out of an SUV, wearing a practiced air of authority. Behind him, a younger man in glasses exited and trotted along behind obediently. Both wore uniforms similar to the soldiers in front of their trucks, but were uncreased and unstained by sweat. 

The young man turned out to be their interpreter, for moments after the leader began speaking Portuguese, he rattled out a formal greeting in perfect, if accented English. The older man was Colonel Otero, and he was delighted to host such distinguished dignitaries from their firm allies, the United States of America. 

A few of the men lined up by the trucks almost sniggered. 

Michelle responded with a token, forgettable nicety and suggested that they make haste to the site of the incident before tropical decomposition had any more time to complete its grisly work. 

There was a small debacle when the Colonel tried to split their group into the three SUVs, each with their own driver and front seat guard. Michelle was having none of it and demanded that they be transported as a unit. Chris thought it was prudent that they stuck together, some of the men were giving the women openly speculative looks. 

The Colonel took it in stride however, smiled evilly, and ordered half of the men from one truck to take their places in the luxury vehicles. Chris groaned as his chance of riding in comfort evaporated faster than his sweat in the muggy air. The men remaining in their awaiting ural seemed very pleased with themselves. 

After clambering up into the back of the tall, off-road truck they were quickly underway. Michelle began unpacking her equipment on the floor as they lumbered onto a highway. Kat, Lisa, Pamela, and Sam soon followed her example, strapping on body armour, readying weapons, checking comms and other electronics. 

The men toward the back of the truck leered at them all the while, muttering suggestive vulgarities. You didn't have to understand Portuguese to know what they were snickering and elbowing each other about. Chris bristled, almost lunging at a man who wolf-whistled when Kat got down to her underwear to put her chest armour on. 

"Don't stress it," Sam whispered to him, patting his thigh placatingly. "We've all been in the armed services or police, we're used to it by now. Besides, I think they're teasing you." 

Chris looked around at the grinning faces watching him, and had to admit that they might be. 

"It doesn't make it right," he muttered angrily as he began getting geared up himself. "I'm going to deck the next man who whistles." 

Instead, he ended up laughing along with the rest of them when the soldiers whistled as he took his own t-shirt off. 

He stood to let the air flow around him and through his sweaty blond hair. Over the railed side of the truck, a mishmash of buildings and jungle sailed by. They were skirting the city, he saw glimpses of it when they crested small hills. Kat joined him, standing on the bench seat to stick her head into the flowing air beside him. 

"So many trees," he wondered at the seemingly endless foliage on all sides. 

"This isn't even proper jungle," Kat teased him as the truck rumbled along. "We won't really see any this trip. Wait until we cross over the Rio Negro, that will be impressive." 

"Everything's got security guards, checkpoints, and crazy fences down here," he pointed to a business they passed with two armed guards posted on the roof. 

"Things are a bit rougher," she agreed. 

For a little while, they drove through the city proper as the highway looped back around to connect to the bridge. To Chris, the side streets they passed seemed chaotic, dirty, and narrow. The drivers of their convoy appeared to rely on having the right of way in almost every situation and it appeared to work. Motorcycles, cars, and even trucks showed deference. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 18|
--------------------------------------------
"Fuck me, it's huge!" Chris stood taller, gripping the ribs which would usually support the truck's canvas cover. The dark river that came into view as they drove out onto the four-lane bridge was massive, easily miles across where they traversed and even wider upstream. 

The other women rose and turned to look at the spectacle, the largest Blackwater river in the world. The men in the truck with them simply shook their heads and ogled the display of shapely bottoms in dark fatigues. Only Pamela sat cautiously, her savage looking Lithgow F90 in hand. He nodded to her, approving of her wariness, he would be wise to do the same. 

He partially opened his magical senses, feeling the relatively lush flow of magic wash over him. The river was veritably teeming compared to what he'd felt in the States. Out as far as his eyes could see, lush forest and river intertwined in an abundance of diversity and magic. It was incredible. If it wasn't so damn hot and muggy, he might consider moving here. 

As they crested the midway point and watched a ship chug underneath, a buzzing note rumbled its low pitched way into his magical awareness. 

He looked around, confused at first as to where it came from. Was it the ship passing below them? Something wrong with the truck's tyres? It was not a good sound, still faint though it was. 

The far shore loomed as they began their descent to the other side of the great river, the repulsive rasping buzz growing louder. It was a frenetic, malicious note. It was a note of corruption. 

"Michelle! He's here!" 

"Here?!" she rounded instantly at the tone of his voice. "Now?!" 

"I'm not... I don't know," he tried to find a way to describe what he was feeling as she took a few careful steps across the truck's deck and made him sit. "Something up ahead is very wrong. It... tastes like Radek." 

"Fuck," Michelle rubbed her temples in concentration. 

The mood in the back of the truck changed rapidly as everyone began to take note. Sam looked worried, Kat found a seat and began loading the spare box magazines for her shotgun, Pamela was cool and collected as ever. 

"Are we going to continue?" Lisa asked, glancing at the now serious army men. 

"Yes, yes, we absolutely have to be here if Radek is involved," Michelle said. "I just wish we were better prepared." 

"We're about as prepared as we're likely to manage," Chris said grimly. "Let's go down there, see what's happening, and deal with the bastard." 

"We could have air support," Kat pointed out. 

"Bitch, I'm a dragon." 

They rode on, mostly keeping silent as Michelle tapped frantically away on her tablet. At their feet, a small, domed satellite uplink connected her back to her support network. She typed away furiously, passing information up the chain of command. Under her skilful fingers, a web was forming. 

In low orbit, three satellites were repurposed from their drug task force operations. After fifteen minutes of diplomatic fandangoing, a pair of A-1A ground attack aircraft scrambled out of Santa Cruz air force base. They would be arriving late to the fight, with little fuel, and a limited scope of operation, but they would be there. 

Chris sat still, feeling like grinding his teeth as the magical discord slithered over his senses. It was wrong, stinking of decay and suffering. The dragon inside him wanted to rip, to tear toward the source of the disruption and burn it from existence. 

They passed a few smaller towns, becoming ever more impoverished as they got away from the relative metropolis of Manaus. The river didn't have defined banks as he was used to. Instead, the entire area was governed by it and any structure on low land was built to float for when the rainy season came. The four lane highway rapidly deteriorated to a paved road, then to a narrow, verge-less continuous pothole. 

"This is it!" Michelle warned as they turned off onto the dirt, passing a deserted roadside market made of sticks and corrugated iron. "I want a tight perimeter around Chris, do not trust sectors to be covered by our friends in green. Keep your eyes wide but stay composed. Turn your body cameras on now please." 

"Yes, ma'am!" Kat shouted, racking a buckshot round into the breach. 

Lisa undid the holster strap on her pistol and gave it a nervous, last minute check. Her thighs were bedecked with extra magazines. The soldiers took the serious mood to heart, checking over their heavy calibre rifles. 

They passed two checkpoints on the way into the evacuated settlement. They charged through without slowing, courtesy of Colonel Otero and his radio operator in the lead SUV. As they rounded a corner, the jungle opened to reveal the village, a sprawling cluster of half-cleared land and buildings. 

They rolled to a lazy stop beside a deserted soccer field, sweat trickling down the back of his neck in both anticipation and dread. A few clouds had appeared in the afternoon sky but it did nothing to assuage the tropical heat. 

"Out!" Michelle ordered as soon as they'd stopped. 

The soldiers snapped to, putting down the tailgate and hastening to get out of the way. Chris' boots hit the red dirt first out of their little group. Instantly he could feel the source of the wrongness. His eyes snapped eastward, through several houses to the spire of a church rising above the surrounding houses. 

"Help me down, would you?" Sam asked from above him, drawing his attention back. "I don't want a broken ankle in the first hour." 

Distracted as he was, he simply hoisted her under the armpits as she turned to use the handles to dismount. She let out a startled grunt at his apparently effortless manhandling but made no further complaint as she straightened her backpack and the heavy plasticized case of forensics equipment slung over her shoulder. 

The others didn't need his help to dismount, except Pamela, who handed him a padded canvas gun case. Whatever was in there was long, heavy, and he suspected it packed a big punch. She took it back off him on the ground, holding it in her left hand as she shouldered her compact rifle to a ready position with the other. 

Otero stopped them as they moved toward the dirt street leading further into the village. Apparently, he wasn't happy that Michelle had been throwing her weight around on their little journey. The NSA agent took it stone faced, nodding along but internally cursing the man for his need to show off in front of his men. 

It was Kat who seemed more likely to do something rash, bouncing on her toes as she looked over the dishevelled buildings with disdain. 

"If you're done," Michelle calmly turned away from the red-faced colonel to address the translator. "Tell your commander that I called in backup because we think the Jack of Diamonds himself could be here." 

The man visibly paled before his translator had begun talking. Apparently, he understood enough English to recognise Radek's military codename. 

"Now," she continued steadily. "We're going in there and we're taking point. If you decide to come along, from this moment onward, you answer to me. Or the dragon." 

As she pointed to Chris' towering figure and the translator spoke, the old military dog swallowed his pride and nodded his agreement. Turning to his assembled men, he barked a few orders which had them forming up into five-man squads and spreading out. 

Kat and Pamela took point, covering their advance through the settlement. Their eyes darted between dark, open doors, checking for adversaries. On either side of the raised road, a half foot of water was all most of the houses had for yards. Shacks might have been a better descriptor, but Chris was too absorbed trying to shield himself from the sickening magic to notice the distinction. 

If the magical dirge was so grating on him, it could be affecting his team members. They showed no sign of adverse effects, but he didn't want to take the chance. His awareness spread out to envelop all of them, holding them close. Only Michelle turned to him questioningly as a tiny shiver ran over her skin. 

A savage barking came at them from the left, startling them all as a chained bulldog exploded at them from around the corner of a low wall. The crazed whites of its eyes and the frothy saliva at its muzzle barely registered with Chris before a single cracking retort silenced the poor creature. Pamela rose from her knee, the barrel of her rifle still covering the twitching body of the hound. 

"Damn, right between the eyes," Kat murmured appreciatively. "You really can shoot that thing one handed." 

"Let's keep moving," Michelle pushed them forward with a look to their rear to make sure none of the following soldiers were spooked by the gunshot. This could turn into an absolute cluster fuck if they lacked fire discipline. 

The first body welcomed them with its putrid stench at the crossroads in front of the church. The poor soul had collapsed underneath the little events notice board, their hand outstretched in plea. A pained snarl locked on their lips as they stared lifelessly up at the blue sky. 

Lisa, Pamela, and Kat took up covering positions as Sam and Chris took a closer look. Otero moved up to stand beside Michelle in stoic silence as he watched. 

"This happened last night?" Sam queried as she put on a pair of disposable gloves. 

"Yes, sometime around four pm we think," the translator provided, breathing through a handkerchief. "Most of the villagers were gathered in the church. The others fled when the screaming began." 

"That can't be right, the decomposition is too advanced, even for this climate." 

She reached to open the bloated corpse's shirt. 

"Don't touch it!" Chris snatched her hand back harshly. 

"I'm wearing gloves, Chris," she scolded, reaching back toward the body. 

"Seriously, don't," he stopped her again. "There's something wrong." 

Ignoring the stares, he looked around for a big stick. In the end, he ripped a long white paling from the church's fence, glancing warily at the magically menacing structure as he did so. 

"Stand back," he warned, carefully pushing the wood under the body and lifting. 

A foul sound and a small explosion of rank air were the reward for his effort, but the body rolled onto its grossly inflated stomach. A few disturbed carrion beetles scuttled away from the sunlight, following their feast as it rolled. 

"Oh my god, I think I might be sick," Kat almost retched at the stench. 

"Look," Chris pointed to a charred circle of cloth on the man's upper back with his stick. "Can we get that off somehow?" 

"I've got a pair of scissors," Sam provided. "If I'm careful I wouldn't have to touch him." 

"Do it, very carefully," Michelle ordered, leaning over the ex-detective with a small camera raised to her eye. 

The shutter clicked away in staccato as Sam cut down from the collar of the cheap flannel shirt, across the scorched section at the base of the neck. 

"What the fuck is that?!" She dropped her scissors and scuttled backward as the corpse's brown skin was revealed. 

Chris nudged the fabric aside, exposing the fading red imprint of a hand. It glowed very softly with a faint crimson light, the flesh inside perfectly preserved while everything around was charred black and crispy. His dragon's sense of wrongness went off like a Geiger counter. 

"It's only got three fingers," Michelle frowned. "The thumb is too far down, the fingers are too long. That... that isn't a human handprint." 

The translator made the sign of the cross but Otero slapped the young man on the back of the head, scolding in Portuguese as he pointed toward the church. 

Chris knelt beside Sam who was breathing hard, her caramel brown skin beading with sweat. Her dark eyes were wide and darting as her scissor wielding hand twitched uncontrollably. 

"Did you touch it?" he asked worriedly, taking her by the shoulders. 

"I... No, I don't think so," she squeezed her eyes shut hard, willing the terror she'd glimpsed to vanish. "I saw something... awful." 

"Shit," Chris muttered as he began pulling her away from the corpse. "Sam, hold still, I'm going to flush your system with magic. I don't know what's going to happen, but just hold on." 

The dragon guided his effort, his magic flowing through her shaking body limb by limb. He saturated every part of her with his own energy until finally he isolated the tiny red spark in the index finger of her right hand. He pounced, metaphorically at least, tearing the evil little coal to shreds. With soothing energy, he washed it away and out of her body. 

Samantha felt everything he did to her, felt his immense magical presence. His spirit, his goodness, his care and concern, she felt it all as he flooded through her. Nerves around her body began a random, lazy firing, creating a confusing mixture of pain and pleasure. A breathy moan left her lips unbidden with his final flood of magic. 

"Damn," Lisa looked on as Sam's body shook and she clung spasming to the large man. "That almost looks like fun." 

"It's not," Chris took off his backpack and let Sam use it as a pillow as she regained her senses. "Tell the men not to touch any part of the body, especially not the hand print. They'll suffer the same fate as these poor bastards, only slower." 

The colonel stepped cautiously away from the corpse to confer with his squad leaders. 

"Do we need hazmat, Chris?" Michelle asked. "What are we supposed to do with the bodies? There are going to be more in the church." 

"We burn this entire village to the ground." 

The inside of the church was a scene of absolute horror. Flies buzzed lazily from corpse to corpse, their eggs long since spent but their instinct telling them to try again and again in the rotting glut. 

Kat was sick, her lunch left dribbling across a wooden pew and onto the packed dirt floor. They had to proceed slowly. Rotting bodies littered the aisle and Chris had to carefully push them to the sides with his piece of stolen fence so they could pass without danger of touching one. 

Otero followed them, hand on his service pistol. Behind him, he practically dragged the young translator by the ear. He left his men to form a perimeter around the church, but his own orders were to never let the Americans out of his sight. With tenacious determination, he forced himself to follow them into that hell-hole. This uniform would need to be burnt, the stench of that much cadaverine and putrescine would not wash out. Even if it did, these would never feel clean again. What on earth would do such a thing to this peaceful village? 

"Chris, we can't stay in here," Michelle almost choked through the cloud of decay fumes. "Some of these gases are dangerous in high doses." 

"We have to get up to the altar!" he shouted, hating every breath he took of the putrid air. "There's still magic here." 

"Look," Sam pointed as Chris rolled another body out of their direct path. "That's the third one that something large has chewed on." 

Chris couldn't bear to think about that possibility other than to wish it had been a large local predator rather than the nibbling of whatever had orchestrated this atrocity. He had to force himself onward, even though his instinct told him to run from the waves of dark magic emanating off the altar. The buzzing was horrendously loud, drowning out his senses. It was all he could do to hold his awareness around those who followed him. If his protection of them faltered now, who knew if they would succumb in the same manner as the poor souls decomposing on the floor? 

Despite the aisle of bodies they'd just waded through, the scene at the steps up to the altar was worse. At first his mind couldn't make sense of it, the dark piles of burnt matter didn't even look like bodies. They were too small, like the bodies had been burned to greying ashes rather than left to rot. It didn't compute until he saw a pair of tiny pink sneakers protruding from one of the dusty remains. Their Velcro straps had melted, blackening under the radiated heat of their owner's combustion. He only hoped it had been quick for the girl. 

Lisa let out a choked sob, drawing his eyes to a different but no less sickening scene. Four corpses, better preserved and yet more severely burnt than any of the others. They were slumped on their fronts, marked repeatedly with the preserving alien handprint. So covered were they that they let off an evil red glow. The feminine shape of their bodies was preserved only by the repeated grip he'd taken on their hips, flanks, and buttocks. He looked away, unwilling to acknowledge the heinous act. 

They stepped up past the gruesome crossing into the tiny chancel. The small alcove was thankfully free of corpses but Chris' sense of dread peaked as he past the wooden pulpit and looked down on the face of the cloth covered altar. 

A thick sheet of... hand crafted paper? It looked right back up at him. 

"What is it?" Michelle whispered beside him, breaking his staring match with the malevolent thing. 

"I don't know. Look at the writing," he drew her attention to the tiny, alien script that scrawled across the entire surface of the brownish, almost leathery stuff. 

"Did it cause all of this?" she breathed, fearing noise would somehow stir it into action as she snapped off a few pictures. "That's the same handprint, right?" 

"Yeah, what about all the smudges though?" 

"Look!" Pamela pointed to something on the floor with her booted foot. "There's more of it." 

Sure enough, when Chris and Michelle squatted lower, they saw a much smaller sheet of the fibrous stuff sticking out from under the altar's discarded ornate bible. Michelle nudged the holy book out of the way with the short barrel of her submachine gun. 

Beneath, a piece just the perfect size to contain the red handprint blinked evilly up at his magical awareness as if angry for his disturbance. It was much thinner and smaller than the other, no writing or dirty smudges. Only the three fingered handprint, faintly glowing its red, sickly light. 

"Any ideas?" Michelle looked to him for answers, the disgust and horror of what she'd seen that afternoon written clearly on her face. "We've got to get out of here soon." 

"Sorry, this is out of my league," he frowned, standing back up. "It's obviously linked to what's happened here. How or why, I have no idea. I suspect that's a good thing. This is the worst kind of magic. I think they were... they were harvested." 

"Could we take a sample of it back to Reyla?" Sam asked tentatively. 

"Absolutely not!" he rounded on her. "We're dealing with this right now before it somehow spreads." 

"Fire?" Kat asked hopefully. 

"Damn straight," Lisa agreed. 

"Okay, everyone pack in behind me," Chris motioned them all into the corner of the chancel as he looked out across the bloated congregation from the altar. 

First priority was to figure out what to do with the little piece. It would be his guinea pig. 

Otero mumbled something to his translator who cleared his throat softly and spoke, breaking Chris' train of thought. 

"Are you going to free their souls?" the man asked reverently. 

"What? No. I don't..." Chris saw the terror on the men's faces and realised that they were probably Christian themselves. "Sure, why not. Yeah, I'll give it a try." 

Fire, aye? He gave it his best shot, focusing over the cloying stench to summon a glowing, crackling orange orb in the palm of his hand. He put his rage, disgust, and indignation into the flame, his sorrow for the burned children, the raped women. It flashed purple, suddenly giving off an intense heat that seemed to burn the stench out of the air. The intensity surprised him as it swelled larger, now the size of a small melon. With a dragon's low growl in his throat, he flung it down on the paper.  
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 19|
--------------------------------------------
It shattered on impact, spewing out little droplets of liquid fire in the same technique he'd learned from his encounter with the elf pyro-mage. Perhaps it wasn't the most prudent idea, because he had to step back, crowding everyone further into the wall to get away from the flames. 

"Woah, it's only burning the paper," Kat was the first to notice the fire's strange behaviour. 

Sure enough, the errant purple flames coalesced, stalking in on the already blackening paper like a pack of hunting dogs. They all watched in satisfaction as the handprint caught, turning the flames a verdant green for a few short moments. No flash of broken magic, no evil cackling voice, nothing. 

The spectacle wasn't over though. Chris watched in fascination as his magical flames dimmed, turned, and began snaking up the edge of the altar cloth. He took a step forward as it neared the top, wondering what he'd unleashed on the world and how he could stop it. 

"Leave it," Michelle said. "It's going for the other one." 

She was right. While the flames had blackened the cloth they'd used to travel toward their malicious target, they weren't spreading. He then realised it had been an incredibly stupid idea to start a fire here while they were trapped in the building. At least he had the Ether as an escape route. 

There was a collective intake of breath as his flames finally met the huge piece of thick, tough paper. The flames lapped at the edges but couldn't seem to get a firm grip. The paper began to curl into itself almost protectively. He fed the fire, dumping magic into it through his outstretched hand until the entire altar top was ablaze and purple flames lapped the plastered ceiling. 

No one could see through the conflagration, but when they saw the flames begin to tint green, they knew it was working. Tentative smiles grew on faces for the first time since their disgusting ordeal began. 

It started as a hoarse, dry sound. Chris noticed it first, but it soon grew around them as the parchment burned. A mumbled scratching, joined a few moments later by a loud wooden thump as a pew out in the nave was knocked to the floor. 

*** 

Six hundred kilometres to the south west, a short, greying man startled awake in the back of an old bus. He licked his dry lips, noting that the sweaty passengers had given him a wide berth as he slept. 

A little smile crossed his lips at the thought. They didn't know why they left him alone in such a crowded bus, not even daring to put their livestock next to him. Perhaps it was his dark aura, or perhaps they'd just thought he must be crazy to wear a suit in the heat. 

He frowned. Something had woken him. 

It was gone. The connection cut prematurely rather than left to run its course. No matter, the most vital of their essence was safely in his briefcase. He patted the dark leather box at his side happily, a rich haul that one. He'd been a very bad man. 

A grunt of amusement rose inside him, making an old toothless woman with a goat in her lap look at him askance. Whoever had been foolish enough to break his spell was in for a nasty surprise. 

He put the briefcase on his lap, twirling the tumblers until it clicked open. Inside, he rifled through stack of unusual brownish paper cards. He flipped one, revealing a livid red hand print. His finger stroked over the sheet almost lovingly, testing for some unquantifiable property. 

Yes. There was plenty of energy left in those bodies. They were in for a nasty surprise indeed. 

*** 

Pamela shot the first walking corpse through the eye before anyone else realised what was happening. Livid red gunk exploded from the back of its head, pulsing with unnatural energy as it splattered against the white wall. 

In the quiet after the gunshot, the flames on the altar died quickly. Of the enchanted paper, only a fine grey powder remained. The corpses it had been magically linked to however, were rising from the ground on unsteady, swollen feet. Perhaps the first shambler had been the owner of the discarded sheet on the floor, freed by the dragon's flames before his fellow congregation. 

Regardless, it appeared a 5.56 mm round to the head didn't pack enough punch. They all watched in stunned horror as it stumbled back a pace, rocking. The creature opened its mouth, revealing a pulsing, gaping, glowing maw. It took a hesitant step forward, a dry, quiet moan issuing forth to the horrified group. 

With a short burst of automatic fire, the freckled blond put six more bullets through the man's chest. She followed with another tap of her trigger, one final slug destroying the side of his half-rotten head. By the grace of all things living, he went down. 

Chris couldn't believe what he'd just seen. His ears rang terribly from the gunfire, his mind was reeling. Everything he knew about magic, everything his dragon knew, screamed that it was impossible. It was wrong, and he was horrified. 

All hell broke loose as Kat levelled her automatic shotgun at the first rape victim to rise. This one didn't stumble or shuffle closer, it leapt. Her buckshot slapped the blackened corpse from the air, tumbling it into the front of the altar with a loud crunch. Chris looked to either side in a daze as Michelle and Lisa began picking targets amongst the dark masses rising in the aisle and pews. This couldn't be happening. 

Luminous, unnaturally red fluid dripped across the floor and walls. Metal ripped through the animated bodies, tearing holes and chunks that were largely ignored. 

"Chris, we're being overwhelmed!" Michelle shouted at him over the crack-crack-crack of Pamela's disciplined three round bursts. "Get us out of here!" 

It was true. The shambling mass of rotten, red-filled bodies was pressing in even as he saw two faster dark figures lead a column of slow shufflers out the main entrance of the church. Then the much more substantial 7.62 mm pills of the terrified soldiers outside began flying into the building. Uncaring of target once they were freed, the heavy bullets zipped through wood, flesh, and even cinder block with ease. 

One grazed across his cheek, vaporising half of his ear. Pamela screamed beside him, falling to the floor as her right shin exploded, the bullet punching straight through her. 

He ducked, reaching to grip his wounded squadmate as she clutched her leg in agony. They were too spread out, too focused on firing into the wall of advancing zombies for him to pull them all into the Ether. Whoever was left behind would be mauled in seconds. 

Another round zipped over his head, punching straight through the cinder wall they were backing into. Michelle cursed, blood dripping down the side of her face from shards of shattered concrete. Chris only saw the little pinhole, through which the outside world, and sanity, beckoned. 

He charged with a mighty roar, magic swelling in him, responding to his pain and his fear. The dragon welled up, a little cowed, but all the more vicious and resourceful for his brush with mortality. 

The cinder block wall buckled outward, spewing rubble onto the lush grass of the cemetery beyond. Armour, cloth, and leather exploded as his body swelled. In a purple shimmer, he grew to its forty-five foot draconian glory in less than two seconds. 

Colonel Otero watched in awe, zombies forgotten, as the broad, adder-like purple head of the dragon snaked back through the hole. 

"Get down!" the beast rumbled commandingly as he opened his great, toothy maw. 

That was all the warning they got. Two beams of blinding pinkish light guttered into existence, scything across the top of the shufflers. Heads, torsos and limbs flopped wetly to the floor, instantly cauterised. 

"Quick, retreat through the breach!" Michelle unceremoniously shoved Sam past the dragon's sinuous neck onto the thick lawn. Already, another rank of corpses crowded up around the altar as the severed halves of their companions oriented themselves and began crawling ever onward. 

Otero and the bloodied translator didn't need to be told twice, they rabbited out as fast as they could. Michelle, Lisa and Kat managed a more dignified fighting retreat as the dragon latched his teeth into Pamela's backpack and began tugging her out of danger. 

He had to admire the wounded woman's tenacity. She was still firing with accuracy as her blood leaked away in pulses from a severed artery. When she looked up and saw an enormous purple dragon dragging her away, she dropped the magazine she'd been holding and lunged for her rifle case. He ended up tugging her none to gently back through the hole as she screamed in defiance and agony, her leg flopping uselessly behind but her prized gun was safe beside her. 

"Bite this, motherfuckers!" Kat screamed as she under-armed an M67 back into the writhing mass of unnaturally sanguine flesh. 

Chris turned his huge body, shielding Pamela from the explosion. Unfortunately, his flailing tail clipped Michelle right in the chest, sending her flying winded across the lawn. 

The grenade went off, hot steel fragments careening through the densely packed mob trying to overcome the obstacle presented by the altar. It was not as effective as the Marine had hoped, barely seconds later, a swaying, rotten corpse loomed in the hole of their broken wall. She punched him backward with an automatic burst of high speed ball-bearings, running the magazine dry. 

With more care this time, he dragged his wounded charge away from danger before he turned to assess what to do next. Sam was helping Michelle unsteadily to her feet while Kat and Lisa took up positions and took turns firing and reloading. The FBI agent's pistol barked rapidly, delivering lead to head with Olympian efficiency. Otero was helping, standing firm now, firing occasionally with his pistol as he snapped commands into his handheld radio. 

Chris was about to rejoice that they weren't getting tagged with friendly fire any more when a burst of automatic fire tracked across his purple flank and spine. He bellowed a roar of pain as one of the bullets wedged unluckily between his scales and sank into his side right at the transition from softer cream to hard purple. 

He swivelled his neck, but found the Colonel rushing to stand in front of him as one of the squads he'd called for backup ran around the side of the church with their guns levelled. The officer was screaming at his men, pointing at the shuffling bodies threatening to pour out of the breach. The men obeyed, firing into the church with only occasional backward glances at the purple dragon. 

Finally, he got a chance to look at Pamela's ruined leg. She was in bad shape. Both bones in her shin were snapped, he could see white fragments sticking out through the meaty mess. She looked up at his cocked head in confusion as he leaned forward and began lapping. 

"Are you eating me?" he felt the hot metal of her gun barrel press into his thick neck. 

"I'm trying to heal you," he rumbled deeply, stilling his forked tongue least she take offence. 

"Oh. Well then, as you were, dragon. I'll reload a few magazines while you're blocking my view." 

She did just that, pulling off her backpack to find the extra ammunition for her assault rifle as he pushed as much of his healing saliva into her wound as he could. 

He watched the fight through one gold flecked eye. Finally, it seemed that overwhelming firepower was prevailing. Fewer legless torsos clawed their way forward, fewer still had use of their legs. It looked like the soldiers had figured out that was the best way to slow them down. No legs, no walking, no running, and definitely no fucking jumping. Hopefully, the men on the other side of the building were faring as well. 

Twitching, rotting corpses were beginning to pile up now. They leaked their filthy, infectious soup of magical red stuff even if they no longer moved or made their terrible moaning. There was so much, it flowed out onto the rubble strewn grass, pooling and slowly spreading. 

When her leg stopped seeping fresh blood, he realised that he needed to end it once and for all. 

"Tell your men not to shoot me," he growled at the translator as he slunk back toward the ruined church. 

He felt into the Ether, sparking one of his black orbs into life. He should have done this from the start if he'd known what was good for him. It grew big under his urging, hungry and soulless, devouring dirt, church, grass, and scarlet glop without prejudice. 

The report of gunfire ceased entirely when the orb grew larger than the roof of the church. He advanced, raking it back and forth, stripping the top meter of soil and everything above as he went. Kat and Lisa moved into position on either side of him as he worked. A pair of warrior angels ready to defend him. 

When he'd swallowed the whole building with his magic, he raised the orb so he could see the terrified soldiers on the other side. A couple of them shouldered their rifles at him but word had spread and their comrades quickly set them straight. 

They had fared worse on this side of the building, caught off guard when the agile blackened women leapt amongst them. Three green uniformed bodies now twitched on the dirt path amongst the vanquished dead, covered in bite marks and vile red stuff. 

"Get back," he warned the gawking, rattled soldiers as he brought the orb back down to scoop up the zombified remains, dead soldiers and all. 

Stripping the entire area down to bedrock to make sure nothing escaped seemed like a good idea so he did the best he could, filling the orb with an ever widening circle of matter. Finally, he felt the pressure building inside as it became overfilled and the mass within excited. 

He fired his plasma breath into it twice, exhausting his strange little glands then letting them recharge. The men sat down to watch in disbelief while the angels crowded around Pamela and fashioned a splint to immobilise her leg. When he was satisfied, he gave a few experimental flaps of his wings before launching into the sky. He circled once, gaining altitude over the jungle before he slipped himself into the Ether. 

The orb had done its job admirably so he changed the parameters to stop sucking in every particle it touched. In the Norm, the black sphere became a perfect mirror as light stopped racing in and began scattering off its surface. It reflected a distorted image off its curved surface back to the watching humans as it rose into the sky. 

Up, up, up, he dragged the huge orb, a writhing purple here in the Ether. The inside of it was molten, but he wasn't taking any chances. Something told him it would be very bad if even a tiny amount of that red shit escaped destruction. Even his plasma wasn't guarantee enough for him. Up he pulled, straining under the load as he flapped up through the featureless grey nothingness of Ether sky. 

In the upper atmosphere, there was even less nothing for his wings to grip. It was all his dragon's flight magic then, pushing him slowly forward through force of will. In an exhausted epiphany, he made a mental note to examine how gravity worked in the Ether. But that would have to wait. 

When he could rise no more, he pushed the purple orb, flinging it outward with all his might. It shrank away quickly, accelerating incredibly under his instruction. Light headed from exhaustion and lack of air, he allowed himself to plummet back toward the green expanse of rainforest. 

As he fell, he felt the orb reach his specified velocity and wink out. The contents would be floating for a good long while with their inherited momentum. Hopefully they crashed into the side of Jupiter, or better yet, the sun. 

He phased back into the village to startled shouts and cheers, a brace of huge river catfish hanging from his mouth. 

*** 

"What now?" he yawned, his bloodied head resting in her lap as they bumped slowly back down the gradually improving road toward the city. His belly was full of fish, he ached, and he just wanted to curl up and sleep for days. 

"In about four..." Michelle, lifted her tablet to check. "No, two minutes, those jets are going to drop six thousand pounds of laser guided explosives on what's left of that village." 

"No, I mean what now? I'm not sure I can manage to take you all back to the States tonight. I'm pooped." 

"Idiot," she laughed, running her hand into his messy hair. "I've never heard of anything so ridiculous. So paranoid you lobbed thirty tonnes of perfectly impoverished topsoil and a whole church into space." 

"I brought my bikini," Kat said hopefully from beside them. 

"So did I," Michelle smiled down at him. "Want to see?"

*** 

Cool, clear water lapped around his ears as he floated, basking in tropical sunshine. He could feel it, hot on his shuttered eyelids, perfectly warm on his pleasantly full tummy. He breathed deep of the humid air, relaxing as the ripples from Kat's swimming bobbed him listlessly around the huge pool. The inflatable lounge beneath him struggled to keep his bulk afloat as he half dozed, a lazy lizard to his core. 

As it turned out, Colonel Otero's family was incredibly wealthy. Their team was now enjoying their second, and last day of his hospitality in what Chris could only describe as a mansion. 

After the scare he'd had at the village, his encounter with the supernatural, the Colonel would not take no for an answer when he insisted that they stay for at least a few days while they recovered. His aging mother was the head of the house, but she was pleased enough to host her son's guests. Even if they were foreigners, her son had impressed their importance upon her, and the matriarch only seemed to emerge at dinner anyway. 

The Colonel was in awe of Chris and showed a keen interest in learning more about the concealed magical world. His own government had told him only the barest details before their arrival. After witnessing the dragon in action, he lamented the poor state of relations between his own country and its Beings, expressing a desire to do something about it. Therefore, while they were his guests, he plied them for every scrap of knowledge they could, in good conscience, reveal. 

And what a place to be a guest. Secluded in the forest on a small rise above Manaus, the eighteen bedroom mini-palace was as ostentatious as they came. Complete with manicured gardens, a stable, a gigantic pool, sprawling greens, and a full staff of over twenty servants, it boggled the farm-raised young man. Actual servants, wearing black and white uniforms, deferential, and attentive. 

Michelle had had to stop him from confronting Otero about it, explaining that while it might offend his sensibilities, such things were still considered normal in this country. Chris didn't believe it at first, but the family had been with the Oteros for several generations. She also assured him that from what she'd seen, the servants were treated very well. Chris had to admit that they seemed happy enough, laughing and joking in Portuguese as they went about their duties. They even had their own complex of cute houses at the rear of the estate. 

It was just such a culture shock to be bustled politely but insistently away from the kitchen when all he'd wanted was a glass of water. Said glass was, of course, delivered a few minutes later by a fetching young woman. It was accompanied by a pitcher of iced lemon water, a selection of pastry goodies, and an exquisite sample of diced tropical fruit. 

Chris lounged in the midday sun, so relaxed that his beer slipped from his loose fingers and upended in the water. Instinctively, his body lunged after it. Too late, he realised his mistake as the protesting inflatable made its escape, skittering out across the water to freedom as he was dumped unceremoniously under the surface. He spluttered to the top, beer bottle in hand, but the beverage ruined. 

Kat laughed at his predicament, bobbing past him as her lithe, dark body cut through the water with a powerful breaststroke. 

"Get me one as well, would ya?" she asked. "I'm almost done here." 

"Sure." Chris watched her glide away, distorted by the rippling liquid. The yellow of her boyshort-bikini looked fantastic against her dark skin. The soldier was in phenomenal shape. 

He rose dripping up onto the ochre-dyed concrete, surrounded by lush, potted growth. Fragrant, varicoloured flowers, ornate bushes, and well-groomed trees bordered the large, curved pool all the way around. It created a relaxing sense of seclusion without hindering the sunlight. 

Shaped sort of like a boomerang, the pool wrapped around the back quarter of the enormous house. He now walked around the inside curve, headed for the kitchen. Otero said it was built that way so that his mother and father could each have their end and not need to see each other. 

Pamela rested on a padded deck chair, her crutches beside her as she read a book and sipped a fresh-squeezed melon juice. He passed her with a friendly nod, and she graced him with a small smile in return. It turned out she had a penchant for tropical fruit, and the catering staff were more than happy to oblige her every fancy. Chris had to agree that she had the right idea, the acai smoothie he'd had with breakfast that morning was out of this world. 

Further around the pool, his olive-skinned Familiar lay sprawled on a thick towel. Her black bikini was a lot smaller than he would have ever imagined her wearing, riding high into the valley of her modest, muscular looking ass as she basked face down, head cradled in her arms. She hadn't moved in a while, and he suspected she'd fallen asleep. Her short black hair was moist and messy from her earlier swim; lips pursed cutely as she breathed restfully. Trying not to disturb her, he snuck past and down the tiled pathway toward the back of the vast, Spanish style mansion. 

A smiling maid noticed his approach and bustled out of the kitchen to meet him, her eyes running appreciatively over his pale physique. He didn't mind, having dosed the entire household with strategic droplets of pheromone cancellation potion on their first night. The young woman could ogle his mass and definition all she wanted without danger of becoming too dragon-struck. 

She snatched the bottle right from his hand with a bobbing little bow. 

"Mais uma?" she smiled sweetly, her dark eyes twinkling. 

"Two, please," he held up two fingers. 

"Dois, sim," she made a gentle banishing motion which he'd understand meant she would bring it to him. 

"Ob... obrigado," he said haltingly. Using about the only Portuguese he'd picked up to thank her as she trotted back into the kitchen. 

It was oppressively hot. The water had been keeping him nice and fresh, but he wasn't sure if he wanted to go back in just yet. The decision was taken away from him when he heard quiet footsteps padding up behind him. 

He turned, finding Michelle looking up at him meaningfully. Her skin glistened with a few beads of sweat brought on by the sweltering heat. She looked lovely. 

Not nearly as asleep as he'd assumed then. Without a word, she stepped into his space and ran her fingers down the muscles of his abdomen very boldly. His cock twitched in his wet trunks. 

"Michelle..." 

"Come on," she took his hand and led him away toward their ground floor guest rooms. He followed in a state of confusion. While his body knew exactly what was about to happen, his mind didn't believe she was really seducing him. Not logical, self-controlled, organised Michelle. Not right here, not now. 

As the hardwood door of her suite clicked shut behind him, any doubt of her intention evaporated. She had this funny little look on her face as she led him to the king bed and pulled him down on top of her. They just stared for a while, motionless as they weighed what was about to happen. 

"Kiss me," she finally breathed. Raising her head off the sheets to meet him with her delicate lips. 

That first kiss awoke something inside both of them. Their bodies quickly entwined, releasing subconscious tensions that had been building for months in a few moments of passionate, tongue duelling, kiss. 

Her fingers found his damp hair, twining, pulling him closer until they almost bruised each other. 

They broke apart, breathing heavily, their mouths only inches away as the huge young man loomed over her. He was rock hard, his enormous shaft sticking up rudely out of his waistband to rub against her cool skin. 

"Fuck," she murmured, looking down between their already half naked bodies to his manhood. 

"Michelle!" he bleated as she reached between them for his cock. "Jesus, what's brought this on?" 

She paused, just her fingertips daintily brushing against his throbbing, vein mottled member. 

"I... I want sex," she started, hesitant to admit it even to herself. "I've been off the pheromone cancellation potion for days now, and it's been driving me crazy. You said we could... if I wanted to." 

"Yeah, but... Are you sure?" 

"Yes! I need you," she moaned, bucking her hips up at him as she pulled his penis down onto her tummy. Her soft eyes pleaded him to provide the answers her body needed. "I don't know what this is between us, Chris. I'm terrible at relationships. I just want you right now. I want to feel you in me." 

"Oh damn, you've got it bad." He dropped his weight onto her, reclaiming her lips in a softer, searching kiss. He cradled her face with one hand as the other stroked her slim flank, across her hip and up to caress the side of her modest breast through her swimsuit. She sobbed into his mouth, writhing beneath his measured touch. 

His erection, very neglected for the past two days, spurted a long stream of warm, slippery pre-cum across her tummy and sternum. 

"Are you cumming?" she whispered, her dilated pupils making her look awestruck. 

"No, thankfully," he smiled, rubbing himself on her skin with hunching thrusts. "He just likes you." 

He reached between them, running his big thumb through the slimy, pungent stuff to collect some. Up to her mouth, he brought it. She frowned, nostrils flaring and turned her head away. 

"Chris that's gross... mmrmmpphh!" she protested only for a second as he smeared it across her kiss-swollen lips. It hit her pink, inquisitive tongue, and her entire body gave a little shudder. "It's sweet? Cinnamon and...mmmmh salty." 

He kissed her tenderly, sharing his flavour on her lips. She was dragon-struck alright. 

That presented a problem, however. Michelle's needy body wasn't going to be satisfied with smooching and petting. She was going to need sex, and she was going to demand his cum deep inside her. 

As he worried her bottom lip between his own, he snaked his hand back down her body, inching toward the warmth of her sex. She didn't protest. In fact, she mewled excitement as his hand slipped under her bottoms and into the warm nest of short-trimmed dark curls beneath. Moisture, warmth, and slick, plump flesh greeting his gentle, probing touch. He ran his finger around her engorged labia, spreading her already leaking juices even as he moved to suck and nibble her soft neck. 

Her nails bit into the bare skin of his broad shoulders as he rubbed up and down her slit, parting large, petal-like inner lips to test the tepid waters. Damn, she was snug. She was snug, and she was completely human. 

"Michelle, I'm sorry we can't," he stroked a little of her stray dark hair behind her ear. "I'm too big. It won't work." 

"No, please! Use an enchantment, like you did with Susan. I want this, Chris. I don't know if I can work up the courage a second time. Please just do it." There was so much desire in her needy tone. 

"I can only do so much right now with a spell," he tried to explain as she ground herself onto his probing finger. "It takes time to work. Michelle, this is a stupid idea. I'd love to go down on you but let's wait a while for the sex." 

"Now," she begged quietly. "A little pain is okay. I've been sore after sex before." 

He shook his head, not believing what he was about to do. 

The magic flowed up out of his core anyway, eager to embrace a new brood member, to have her. Sitting back on his haunches, he pushed his fat prick to the side as she stared lustily up at him. The string ties at the sides of her suit-bottoms quickly vanished, and the skimpy garment discarded as he focused his mind on performing the spell. 

One big hand moved to cover her slippery mound. The other rested low on her toned belly. It was a delicate process, but he'd had practice now. Given the urgency, Chris felt confident enough to push a little more power into the spell this time. 

He let his magic flow down into her womanhood, opening her, readying her. It raced to its tasks, increasing her elasticity and muscle tone, promoting elongation of her vagina. He found her Bartholin's glands and zapped them into overdrive. Her cervix was magically reinforced and strengthened to grow new, spongy pleasure centres at its head. In addition, he created the basis for a magical feedback loop between arousal and the production of her tacky, cervical mucus. He'd done his damn research with Susan, and it paid off for them now. 

Michelle squirmed, her entire nether region heating, twitching, and shuddering under his magical reworking. Her clitoris was screaming for attention, and it was like he somehow sensed her need. His hands took the back of her thighs and pushed them high as he shuffled backwards and began lapping his warm tongue over her pussy. 

"Oh fuck! Yes! Oh, yes!" she moaned in ecstasy as he wasted no time slipping two thick fingers into her little pink hole. 

Chris couldn't help smiling as he sucked gently on her labia and tried to coax her eager, juicy quim to accept a third finger. Stupid as this might be, it was going to be fun. As she loosened to admit it, he pushed the flat of his tongue onto her erect little button and shook his head back and forth remorselessly. After only a few seconds, she let out a hoarse scream, a powerful climax bursting inside her. 

Michelle's whole body arched, locking in perfect agony. Chris had never seen anything quite so... exorcism-like? She froze, making husky little grunts in the back of her throat as her legs and tummy twitched. It felt like her vagina heated, becoming slicker around his slowly probing fingers as she came. Her unusual reaction went on for half a minute until he got concerned that she wasn't breathing and let up on her clit. It appeared he'd damaged the usually restrained woman. 

With a shuddering gasp, she came back to life, quivering all over as she pulled him up to her eager lips. She veritably attacked him, forgetting to breathe, and wrapping leanly muscled arms around his torso. 

"I didn't know... it could be... like that," she finally wheezed. 

"I have to give most of the credit to magic, unfortunately. You're primed like a little volcano, ready to erupt." Feeling very full of himself, he grinned and kissed her nose. "I suppose it's my magic though." 

"I don't care what it is. Give me a second to get this damn top off," Michelle began squirming to get at the black strings. "Then I need you to fuck me." 

Chris didn't need to be told twice. As Kat got out of the pool, wondering where the hell he'd gone and why she now had two beers, he shucked his swim trunks, entirely freeing his mammoth rod from its cruel confines. 

"Getting second thoughts?" he asked, noting her wide-eyed gaze riveted to his angry, pulsing crown as it splashed more excitement across her skin. "We don't have to. The enchantment won't be fully ready for almost a week." 

"No," she smiled softly, looking up into his tender expression as she pulled the loose bikini away from her breasts. She was aching with need. "Now, please." 

"Have I told you how beautiful you are?" 

Her breasts captured his attention completely, paler than rest of her torso but still possessing the lovely tone gifted by her Mediterranean heritage. They were perfectly proportioned to her athletic body, small handfuls of soft, tan-lined perfection. He leaned forward to examine her small brown areola and discovered what had caught his attention. Her nipples were inverted, hiding from him. That would undoubtedly require further investigation. 

"I don't believe so." Michelle squirmed under his avid scrutiny, hands self consciously twisting over her tummy as he looked her over. It was so silly to feel embarrassment at a time like this, but she couldn't help it, she felt like hiding herself. 

"Well, you are." He leaned in to kiss and suck at her collarbone, down onto the swell of her right tit. "You're perfect." 

"How can you say that?" she asked, cocking her head to watch him snuffle and suckle her at her breasts. "I live with you. I know the other women you sleep with are prettier. Hell, Lillian is..." 

"Lillian isn't Michelle," he interrupted her a little sternly, a hint of the dragon in his voice. "Michelle is Michelle, and she's perfect in her own way." 

Her little smile told him she understood what he meant. The way she pushed his hips backwards and reached to guide his massive head to her weeping slit told him what she wanted. 

Moisture and warmth greeted him, but he made sure to rub up and down across her glistening labia to get them both ready. Her hand was next to his on his shaft, guiding, exploring. He twitched, adding his own slippery lubrication to the mix as he tapped his heavy member against her erect, eager clitoris. 

"Enough." She pulled him into her slot. "Be gentle, but don't you dare stop." 

Wordlessly, he nudged forward. Michelle winced at the stinging stretch, her lips struggling to envelop even his thick crown. Then in a slick rush, he was inside her heat. 

"Owww! Fuck, you're too big!" Her hands scrabbled at his hips, holding him at bay as her entrance throbbed painfully around his girth. 

"I'm sorry, we'll stop," he began to gingerly pull away, but her nails dug into his thighs. 

"I said don't you dare stop," she breathed through the discomfort as she adjusted to his size. "Okay, a little more. God, it's got a fearful girth about it." 

It was exquisite torture being inside Michelle. She was hot and wet and almost unbearably tight for him, but he couldn't move other than little rocking thrusts. Sometimes he gained ground, sometimes he didn't. She felt incredible wrapped around him either way, but he wanted to fuck, to feel her coming apart beneath him. 

Having not died yet and with the initial pain fading, Michelle consciously tried to relax. It made a big difference to them both, and he slipped through a few extra inches of warm snugness, finally nudging her limit. Pre-cum gushed from his fat tip as he flexed his love-muscle, splattering hotly against her cervix. 

"Oh wow, okay that's deep." She looked between their bodies, a little dismayed to see much of his member still outside her. "Fuck me, Chris. I can handle it." 

"Okay. You feel great, Michelle, so hot," he whispered encouragement in her ear as he began a slow, gentle pumping. 

"Ghaaah!" she cried, coming alive to the wonderful sensations inside her as he lovingly pulled out and impaled her again. "Oh! Oh, ahhh... Oh! I'm so full, Chris! Fucking... God! Fuuuuck!" 

He smiled from ear to ear as she cried out to him, revelling in the intense friction as he slid home into her tight pussy. She was huffing and puffing and loving every second of his lovemaking. Her long legs wrapped up around his back, urging him on. Damn, she was a firecracker. He wasn't going to last if she kept looking up at him pleadingly with those huge brown eyes either. 

"Yes! Like that, just like that! Chrisssss..." She squirmed beneath him, reaching to hold his face and kiss him as he filled her completely. He loomed so large above her, so powerful. Such a tender, sweet young man who'd supported her in every endeavour and was there at the end of the day to share her frustration and rub her tired shoulders and... Oooohhh, he was an incredible lover. Never in her life had she experienced anything on this level of carnal satisfaction. She couldn't wait to feel his seed shooting hot within her, to receive his magic and satisfy the burning need in her core. 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"We should have done this months ago," he grunted in pleasure as his knob dragged back and forth through her sensitive pink folds, his thick head pressing incessantly across her g-spot. 

"We'll... make... oh fuck! ... up for it." She felt out his defined chest, caressed his heaving abdominals as he fucked her so carefully, so gently. Looking up into his intense eyes, she begged for what she needed most at that moment. "Give it to me, Chris. I want it, please!" 

"Fuck!" he growled. It was as if Michelle's plea had a direct line to his cock, swelling him to utmost hardness. There was no point in holding back. She was so tight, and her avid cries of passion were incredibly arousing. Never in his life would he have thought she'd be such a vocal, enthusiastic lover. His abdomen began to shudder and tense as he drew in magic, his balls tightening for the climax she was eagerly milking from him. 

"Mmmmmhhh... More! Please more... Fuck yes!" She began shaking, her womanhood squelching obscenely as she squeezed hot around his huge cock. "Chris! OOHHH! I'm going to cum! Go with me...AAAHHH!" 

"Jesus, Michelle!" he groaned as she clamped down on him like a velvet vice, almost forcing him out of her spasming pussy along with the little trickle of her slippery cum. Her heels beat a giddy tattoo of pleasure on his firm butt. He squeezed his eyes shut tight as he teetered on that beautiful precipice of climax. Then the first shudder of blissful release raced through his entire body as an enormous pulse of hot semen raced upward to burst forth from his throbbing tip. 

Michelle arched violently again, it couldn't be helped. So vocal before, she was suddenly silent, her body rigid as pleasure exploded deep within. He held on, hunching deeper to find the perfect angle. 

She felt him surge, felt him splash hot against her cervix. It was the most incredible, intimate feeling but she barely had time to enjoy it. An alien, heady rush swept through her. It grew and grew as he spurted, rushing through her nerves, setting off an unstoppable cascade of pleasure. What strength she had left was lost as it roared loud in her ears, through her body, seeping into her very bones. It made her tingle all over and almost want to wriggle away it was so intense. So this was what all the fuss was about? 

Then he did something, shifted somehow, and his heat bloomed deeper, into a part of her she'd only ever felt during the cramp of her period. A rich, intoxicating satisfaction blossomed deep in her core. This was precisely what she'd needed all along. Desperately, she tried to cry out, but her body would not respond, swept up in the maelstrom of his magic and her own catatonic tendencies. 

"Uhnnnggg!" Michelle finally gurgled beneath him as he pinned her hips and shot heavy, satisfying pulses against her dilated cervix. It was incredible, and she tried to tell him so. "Chris... oh, my... hmmm..." 

He sighed in complete satisfaction, throbbing his sticky, magic-rich spend deep into her womb. It squelched and seeped around their coupling, too much for her to reasonably contain. It didn't matter, Immi wasn't here to police the situation. Only their pleasure, their bond, their magical link mattered in that perfect moment. 

Right up until Kat barged in. 

"Michelle, have you seen Chris? I... Chris?!" 

"What the fuck! Knock!" He lurched backwards, startled and embarrassed by their sudden audience. 

It would have been better if he'd stayed on top of Michelle because his enormous, still lazily spitting erection wrenched free of Michelle's inflamed vulva. Everyone saw as it unleashed three more thick white ropes across her mound, thighs, and tummy. One courageous line of white made it all the way to her cheek and into her dark hair, making her twitch away for fear her eye was next. 

"Jesus!" Kat yelped in shock, gaping at the huge pool of semen between her boss's legs. Her expression went through a comic dance from surprise to offence to downright astonishment. "You're bigger than fucking Billy-the-bull-cock-Rodriguez." 

"What?!" He blinked at her, dumbfounded by a combination of outrage and pleasure. 

"Kat! Get out!" Michelle shouted as she capped the end of his throbbing penis with her palm. 

"Oh... sorry ahh. Your beer's waiting, Chris. Have fun." She backed out slowly, clearly glancing between the two of them. 

When the door shut, Chris put his forearm over his eyes and groaned, still catching his breath as his cock throbbed with post orgasm sensitivity. 

Below him, Michelle's sides began to shake until a peal of laughter broke free. It was contagious, and his rumbling boom joined her as he fell back on top of her slim, cum-splattered body to kiss her. 

"Did you see the look on her face?" Michelle finally managed as she swiped his spilt seed with her hungry tongue. 

"Which one?" he wheezed, rolling them the side. 

"Mmm... Damn. I can't believe we just did that," she kissed his chest as they settled into a loose hug in the air-conditioned room. "I'm a cradle snatching, cliche boss taking advantage of her young employee." 

"Take all you want," he teased. "You were quite demanding there for a bit, I like it. All our little talks made me think you were going to be a dead fish or something." 

"Shut up! No, you didn't!" she slapped his brawny arm playfully. Wriggling up the bed a little so they were face to face, she took his hand and clasped it to her chest. "Sorry, Chris, this whole thing wasn't very well planned. It was rash, I shouldn't have just stopped taking the potion like that I..." 

"Hush," he put a finger to her lips. "It's okay." 

"I feel great, but I'm going to be really sore tomorrow, aren't I?" she groaned. 

"I'm no expert on such womanly matters, but yeah, I'd say so. Sorry." 

"But we did it," she nuzzled under his chin, breathing deep of his pheromones as his potent magic pooled hot in her womb, a volcanic lake of magic and teeming gametes. "We really did it. Better not let people sneak up on us like that again though, it could be dangerous." 

"Typical Michelle," he chuckled. "But point taken. I was a bit distracted." 

"Mmmh, no excuses. I've never felt so good like this afterwards," she yawned, entwining her legs with his. "It's delicious, thank you." 

"Then just lie with me and enjoy it for a while. You deserve to relax, Michelle." Tenderly, he drew her close and reached to pull a sheet over them, knowing they would soon be drowsy. They could give in to a few hours post-coital cuddling. 

Nice as their stay had been, they had to leave their host, and the indulgences of his tropical mansion behind. His strength had well and truly recovered now, and Denver beckoned them home. 

*** 

Chris awoke to the rustle of bedding and quiet murmuring. Annabel and Immi slipped out of his arms. He heard them fossicking for clothing in drawers, or in Immi's case, rustling through the garments she'd strewn on the floor. 

Snuggling deeper into his pillow with a tired groan, he enjoyed those last precious moments of rest. It felt like he'd barely closed his eyes since they'd all arrived back. Jumping halfway up the continent with five hitchhiking angels was no mean feat. 

The flapping of the ever-growing sprite's wings signalled the doom of his wonderful dosing. Immi dropped on him like a small sack of potatoes, crawling up to nuzzle her way under the covers he'd pulled over his head. 

"Get up, sleepy," she coaxed with a dainty nibbling of his chin. "You promised you'd practice with us today." 

"Does today have to start so early?" he complained, rolling onto his back. He rubbed his scratchy eyes and flexed his legs, stretching himself awake. 

"You're the one with the strict schedule, Babe," Annabel flopped down on the bed beside them, dressed in form-fitting workout clothes. "We're getting up early just for you." 

"Would it hurt if you didn't fill crystals with Petra for one more day?" Immi teased. "I'm sure the magical economy would survive." 

"Petra might not," Annabel giggled. Leaning forward, she employed a technique she'd learned long ago and blew maddeningly in his ear. 

"Arghh! I'm up. I'm up!" he protested, rolling off the other side of the bed with Immi clutched to his chest. The sprite was actually wearing clothes, a tiny set of black spandex shorts and one of Annabel's ratty old pink t-shirts modified to fit her wings. "Dammit woman, I was just shot in the ear." 

"Baby," Immi tittered. 

"We all know it's healed perfectly." Annabel rose off the bed and came to stand before him. "We're doing this so you don't get shot again, okay? If that bullet had been... No. I don't want to even think about it. That absolutely cannot happen, Chris." 

"I'm sorry, Dee." He opened his arms and scooped her up too, a three-way dragon hug. They squeezed each other close, reinforcing their love. 

"I can't lose you, Master. We're going to train every chance we get," Immi sniffed, on the verge of breaking into tears. 

"Thank you, both." Freeing a hand, he stroked the sprite's midnight-blue hair tenderly. "I promise I'm working on some more defensive abilities. It was a scary experience, and I'm going to learn whatever you can teach me." 

"Good." Annabel stood on the toes of her sneakers to kiss him, encouraged that he was taking their concern seriously. "Let's go." 

He hoisted his beloved sprite princess higher in his arms to kiss her too, setting her azure wings trembling. 

It didn't take him long to get dressed once Immi could be persuaded to let him go. He would likely go to the gym for his usual schedule after they were done with whatever mysterious lesson the two beauties had concocted. 

The duelling chamber was one of the deepest structures of the Compound, situated next to the extremely well guarded and magically defended nexus. The nexus was apparently the magical heart of the Compound, whatever was inside held most of the magical structure's spells. Neither Annabel or Immi could tell him what that might involve though, Reyla was the only person allowed inside. 

They passed three separate checkpoints on their way down, each guarded by a member of night shift security who operated the various impassable or simply deadly magical barricades. 

Timothy Garril's office even had to be negotiated on the final corridor, the elemental stuck his head out the door as he saw them approach and wished them a cheery good morning. 

The various guards welcomed Annabel and Immi back like old friends. They made respectful, if surprised comment on Chris' appearance though. Not many used the chamber, but apparently his First and her small lover had become regulars, and the guards were happy to have even a single visitor on such a boring shift. 

"The entire room is coated in a foot of enchanted copper," Annabel explained what she'd been told as best she could as they approached the last checkpoint. "It absorbs stray magic, spells, whatever touches it really. They get channelled into some sort of magical scrapping spell and passed through into the nexus to help power it. At least, that's how Reyla 'explains it to five-year-olds'." 

"Not many Beings can afford to practice their magic at full intensity, so it doesn't see much use these days," Immi added. "It's always been abandoned when we came to practice. No one's fought a real duel here for almost sixty years." 

They turned right just before the final portal to the nexus, encountering a heavy metal door. It was old, a swirling, motley mix of brown, red, and blue-green copper, languishing in various states of corrosion. The handle was a wooden wheel which Annabel began unwinding. 

"Try not to touch the metal," she warned as it swung inward. "It pulls energy away pretty quickly." 

"So this is how you've been spending my magic," he mused as one by one, they stepped across the threshold onto a scarred wooden floor. "I wonder why Arvil never brought me down here?" 

The room was a vast dome, easily twenty-five meters across and half as high. A single, massive light globe spluttered to life as unknown mechanisms detected their presence. The only other feature was a white ring of what looked like sand or tiny stones surrounding the centre of the chamber. Chris assumed it marked the boundary of the duelling circle, it was large enough so that there were only a few meters between it and the sloped walls. 

"Despite his expertise in Ether theory, that chocolate elf is not an accomplished combatant," Immi scowled. "I've told him before that you need a broader, practical education and a quick magical repertoire. He's so infatuated with your natural control over the Ether that he gets distracted." 

"Oh." Chris looked around at the pocked, gouged, and scratched metal walls. The copper must have seen some things in its time. "Hey, I've been practising a little magic though. I can summon fire, and I once froze a bucket of water. I've been reading about other spells, too." 

"But you haven't been throwing your entire essence into that magic have you?" Immi raised a finger like a learned sage. "You haven't unleashed with all your might?" 

"No, that's dangerous," he protested. 

"Not in here," Annabel took his hand and drew him over to the edge of the ring. "Watch us." 

His beautiful mates stepped confidently over the threshold, the fingers of one hand interlaced with the other. The top of the growing sprite's head almost came up to his First's hip now. He knew it wouldn't be too long before he awoke in the middle of the night with the little princess trying to mount him. 

As one, they glanced back to make sure he was watching before Immi muttered something under her breath. 

A white shimmering raced down her free arm. It shot from the sprite's outstretched fingertip as a brilliant cascade of web lightning. The magic branched through the air instantly, grounding against the far side of the chamber in multiple, resounding strikes. 

He took a hurried step backward, shocked at the intensity of the magic she'd just unleashed. A livid afterimage of those powerful tendrils burnt into his retina. Such a spell could have easily fried a small pitchfork-bearing mob, very handy. Yet, the sprite had just let loose, and the duelling chamber took it stoically. 

A wide jet of unnaturally purple-edged flames blossomed across the room as he recovered. His hand automatically moved to shield his eyes this time, but it wasn't necessary. Annabel stood tall, hand in hand with her friend as her outstretched arm unleashed the torrent of scintillating fire. 

On her slim forearm, Bartholomew dug his claws in and roared, spurting flames across her skin that flowed harmlessly over her and leapt into existence from her outstretched palm. His First raked the magical flamethrower back and forth across the wall, darkening it momentarily before it faded back to its sickly blend of pock-marked green and red. Above them all, the colossal light orb flared and sputtered in sympathy before returning to normal as the flames died. 

"Immi has been teaching me defensive shields, too." Annabel turned to her shocked fiancé with a satisfied smile. "It's a little tricky, but we've worked out a couple of methods to practice in reasonable safety." 

"I noticed at the nightclub," he approved, stepping into the circle to sweep them both up off their feet. "This is incredible Annabel, I didn't realise how accomplished you're becoming. That fire... there was a lot of magic behind it." 

"I said I would become strong for you," she nudged him playfully. "Though to be fair, Bartholomew is doing the work. I'm just the evil mastermind with an irresistible vagina." 

"And I'm the plucky sidekick who teaches them magic," Immi chirped proudly as his brawny arm squeezed against her waist. "It's like a fairyta... No! No fairies. " 

"You are far from a sidekick, my wise little sexpot. What else have you been practising?" he asked. 

"All sorts of things," Immi practically radiated under his praise and began counting off on her little blue fingers. "Lots of different barriers, a little basic dispelling, simple runes, some enchanting, and a few offensive spells." 

"Bartholomew does best with fire," Annabel explained. 

"I like lighting, it's fast and crackly!" 

"She got excited and zapped me through my shield spell the other day, now it's her favourite." 

"It's always been my favourite!" the sprite protested. 

Chris looked between them, his pride overflowing. He'd been so busy, so distracted over the last few months, but they'd forged ahead. Annabel was becoming a magic user, just like she'd wished. His emotions were a little conflicted, he was very happy for her, but it was tinted with disappointment that he'd missed all the practice sessions they'd obviously shared. No wonder they'd grown inseparable. 

"Show me what to do," he said, freeing his magic to rush eagerly through his body. 

Immi's eyes fluttered for a moment as she basked in his upwelling of clean, tasty magic. 

"Have you managed to make a kinetic shield before?" She blinked up at him, taking his hand and leading to the very centre of the room. "I know you've read some theory. Try it." 

Chris did try. He tried very hard. The problem for him was maintaining the necessary concentration. His brand of magic was based on feeding energy to focused intentions. That was all very well when you wanted to do something emotionally charged, something fast and powerful, something the mind could easily comprehend. Scorch that enemy, sure. Heal someone you cared for, okay. Teleport to that place right over there, no problem. Even blessing a small child with luck and fortune was not too far of a stretch, so long as the thoughts were simple and didn't have to be held. 

Trying to keep his mind focused as he willed a sphere of protective magic around himself was a problem. Forming it was okay, not great, but manageable. But then the spell had to be maintained, the intention focused, logical, and controlled continuously. A stray thought could ruin him, and he hadn't even had anything fired at him yet. 

As Immi and Annabel watched him struggle, he tried adding extra magic. It worked to begin with, but as soon as his mind wondered, it was even more likely to slip away from him. Next, he tried channelling his anger and frustration. That usually produced excellent results when he fought, but instead of a shield, he created a nova of kinetic force. His audience of two was thrown to the wooden floor in a tangle, a blue wing snarling in Annabel's long, braided hair. That trick might have come in handy against those animated corpses. 

"Stop this at once!" Reyla burst into the room, breathing heavily. 

"Reyla?" He was genuinely confused. 

"Get out, dragon! You're going to break my nexus!" Behind her in the hallway, a few Beings in black security uniform vied for a better look. 

"What? I..." 

"Now, please!" she entreated, rushing forward to grab his hand. The dark-skinned elf began pulling him urgently toward the door, ignoring Immi and Annabel as they gingerly took apart the brunette's plat. 

Chris went along with her, quickly led from the duelling chamber and down the hallway a way before she rounded on him, relief clear on her beautifully regal face. 

"What did I do?" He frowned, noting how dishevelled her usually perfect white hair was. Damn, she was in her nightgown again, her tall, slim figure shrouded only in sleek, dark cloth. He must have rousted her out of bed. 

"Do! What were you thinking!? I..." Her pointed ears drooped minutely as she exhaled, trying to let go of her temper. It was the dragon she was speaking to, not some scuttling underling. "I'm sorry, Chris. There is no real harm done, I think. A close thing though." 

"What happened?" Annabel burst out of the chamber behind them, Immi peeking over her shoulder from piggyback.

--------------------------------------------
"He was rapidly overloading the enchantments protecting the Compound," the territory leader rounded on the culprits. "You and your royal strumpet are one thing, I suppose I should thank you for the energy you've donated this last month. But he, he cannot throw around his magic like that, not around my delicate arcane mechanisms!" 

"Reyla, I'm sorry. We didn't know," Annabel apologised, genuine remorse clear in her expression. "We were just trying to make Chris practice some practical defensive magic." 

"And how did that go?" the elf inquired, her perfect snowy eyebrow rising. "Not well, I think." 

"No," Chris sighed. "I don't understand, you saw my Ether orb magic. Why can't I hold a simple barrier?" 

"So, you finally confront the limitations of your magic," Reyla nodded thoughtfully. "Your mastery of the Ether is not in question, but intention has never been a good match for such spells, the untrained mind is much too fickle. Runes are the best for shields, enchanted items second." 

"I taught Bartholomew the runes for shielding," Immi admitted a little sheepishly. 

"Ah, so you do have some sense in that head of yours. Then use it, sprite. You should have anticipated he would not easily make a barrier spell. Only the most disciplined learn to split their mind...But, I did not rush down here to give a lecture. Once again you've ruined my sleep, dragon. I'm going back to bed." 

"But... split the mind?" he puzzled. "What does that even mean?" 

The elf smiled ruefully at the large young man, her ears flicking in amusement. 

"Ask me again in a thousand years, you might be ready to start learning then. For now, if you want defensive spells, make a few trinkets, some enchanted armour. If you're industrious, you could consider protecting your new human friends, too." 

"I hadn't even thought about that option," he admitted, brightening as his brain raced to new possibilities. "Thank you, Reyla." 

"You're welcome, dragon. But, I ban you from this level. Your mates may continue to practice here, but you must find somewhere suitably desolate for one such as yourself." She cocked her head meaningfully on the last words, managing to look decidedly avian. 

"I... Yes." 

"Thank you, Reyla," Annabel added. "We're sorry." 

"All is well, disaster averted. Chris, I will see you later this morning, no? Good day." 

With a grace practised over thousands of years, she swivelled and glided away. 

"Well that didn't go as planned," huffed Immi as they moved aside to let the security crew out. "Now he's banned." 

"It's okay. I learned something valuable, and Reyla gave me a great idea," he said. "Why don't we go up to the gym for a while?" 

"Squats?" Immi asked over Annabel's shoulder. 

"Squats and cardio," his First agreed, hitching her blue, winged limpet higher on her back as she led the way up the corridor. "Every day is an ass day, isn't that right, Immi?" 

"Yeah!" 

Chris shook his head, ogling their exquisitely proportioned rumps stacked one on top of each other in the clingy fabric of workout pants. That specific arrangement set his imagination wandering and his cock hardening. 

It was still very early, so they snuck in forty minutes of workout before Chris had to leave for his appointment with Petra. Michelle showed up halfway through but was strangely taciturn, managing to stay on the opposite side of the massive facility to him with uncanny accuracy. It was like she was trying to ignore that they'd made love. To be honest, it hurt him a little. 

He didn't bother showering when he was done. The mature dragoness loved it when he came to her streaked with sweat and extra musky. As he pinned her to the wall and lovingly ravaged her, Immi and Annabel showered and prepared for their day at the culinary academy. 

The budding chef consulted her diary for her meal plan. She began ordering ingredients on the benchtop and assembled the top of the line food processor Chris had given her as a gift three weeks ago. It was her pride and joy, along with her Japanese knives. 

Into the blender went onion, tomato, fresh coriander, garlic, and chilli. Immi showed up and was put to work making fresh tortillas. Susan emerged and showered as she began heating the fragrant puree and opening a can of refried beans. That turned into two cans, better safe than sorry with Chris. 

The fresh tortillas smelled delicious as they browned in a skillet under the sprite's vigilant watch. The aroma of frying chorizo and egg soon joined them. It was all coming to a frenzied climax of activity, a rush to have the components of her carefully planned meal prepared on time. 

As Annabel worked to bring everything together to a perfect moment, Chris did the same. Petra groaned in bliss, her loose platinum hair sweaty and clinging to her heaving breasts as he spurted deep within her. With arms wrapped up around his neck, she gripped an empty quartz crystal in each hand, doing her best to relax and let his magic flow through her. She was his vessel, the chalice for his magic, and she loved it. With a smile of pure joy, she thumped her head back into the wall and keened. He roared with her, seeding her over-filled loins again and again. 

"That's the five-minute mark." Annabel's head cocked to the sound of the dragons' passion. "Start grating that cheese please, Immi." 

"Okay, Mistress," the sprite chirped happily. 

As the busy pair began plating out breakfast into shallow bowls, the dragon's brood assembled. Susan skirted around them to put on a large pot of coffee. Slipping a little stiffly into a chair at the dining room table, Michelle began catching up on the emails she'd ignored whilst in Brazil. Lillian was absent, her meeting on the west coast was keeping her longer than expected. The messages she'd sent Chris on Maginet suggested that their reunion this evening was something to look forward to. 

Finally, Chris and Petra arrived, rosy-cheeked and still damp from their brief shared shower. Claire and all her red-haired beauty brought up the rear. 

"It's like they're running on clockwork," Annabel smiled. 

"More like cock-work," Immi giggled as she ran across the benchtop, sprinkling cheese, avocado, and a dollop of sour cream into each bowl. 

"I'll show you cock-work, you little minx." He strode into the kitchen and swept his miniature mate into a heated kiss. Standing on the kitchen bench in her tiny apron, Immi was just the perfect height for it. 

"That's exactly what she wants, you big dummy. Now, unhand my assistant," Annabel laughed at their antics. 

"What do you have for me to devour this morning, Dee? It smells amazing." 

"It's huevos rancheros," Immi supplied. "Could you please take that big stack of tortillas to the table, Master?" 

"The coffee, too, please honey-bun," Susan piped from the dining room. 

Chris was more than happy to help in any way he could and carefully brought the desired items to the table before returning to help with the warm bowls of spicy goodness. It amazed him every time he saw Annabel at work, and he loved to support her passion for cooking in any way he could. It wasn't just for the fulfilment of his bottomless tummy either. 

His First took genuine enjoyment from making an excellent meal and learning new dishes, new ways to cook. Annabel was simply incredible, and he lavished her passion with praise, appliances, and extravagant ingredients. He didn't care that half his paycheck from the BIA seemed to disappear into their stomachs, it was absolutely worth it. 

As the plates arrived, they didn't stand on ceremony. They knew Annabel would join them as soon as she was ready and she didn't want them waiting for her while things got cold. 

"Mmhhhmm!" he groaned as he scooped his first piece of soft, warm flatbread into the hot soup-salsa and dug in. "Oh, my God. Annabel, I think this is my new favourite breakfast. Heck, you could have this for lunch and dinner, too." 

"Thank you, Annabel, this is amazing," Claire agreed as she combined egg, salsa, chorizo, and sour cream in a dainty forkful. 

A chorus of agreement and praise ran around the table. The chef took a happy bow, and her blue assistant did a little jig before they high-fived and sat down with the others. 

"Tell us all about your trip, Michelle," Susan prompted. "Was it terrifying? I think I would have fainted if I'd seen one of those bodies let alone if it got up and tried to kill me!" 

*** 

Chris rose from his desk as the elevator chimed, his magical senses releasing an answering ping off her presence. Reyla swept out, her human guise in place. Keen eyes brushed over the faces that turned to note her appearance on the top floor of the BIA office. Her grey gaze found him with raptor-like efficiency. She honed in, flanked by two burly shifters. 

Her elegance never ceased to amaze him, and the dark overcoat she wore over her refined blue gown did nothing to hide it. With perfect dark brown skin, flowing silvery white hair, and her patented elfin glide, she was a creature of beauty obviously out of place in the pack of humanity. This facade belonged on a catwalk and just seemed unsuitable anywhere else. 

A few of the newer BIA recruits looked around nervously, seeking reassurances from the more experienced members that the presence of the somewhat legendary Lady Narlakis was anticipated, or at least didn't herald their imminent doom. 

"So this is where you work?" she drawled, clearly unimpressed with his spartan little cubicle. "A bit beneath your station, don't you think?" 

Her bodyguards waited patiently in the background, giving the elf and dragon a little space. 

"It's okay," he shrugged. "I don't really do that much here. If there's no work to do, I'll go train or just hide in the Ether, pretending to be busy." 

"I see. And what's this?" The elf snatched up the sheet of paper he'd been scribbling on. "Interesting. Yes, it might work if you knew anything at all about runecraft. A promising start though." 

"You wouldn't be interested in helping me, would you?" he asked. "I'm thinking I'll have to make at least twenty, one could be yours, if you helped?" 

"I could be persuaded," she smiled, giving him back the sketch. It depicted a series of gems inlaid in narrow bands of rune etched metal. The fixtures holding each individual stone had small loops on each side, through which a chain ran. Five such gemstones were attached to the chains, one on top of the other to create a spell. He'd gotten the idea from the incredible mythril curtain the goblins had installed to protect his mate's grotto. "I hope you know an amenable dwarf, such fine metalwork will not be easy. I'm not sure how the clan-smiths would like working for a dragon." 

"That again. I don't get it," Chris confessed. 

"Beings have very long memories, that is all. Dark and light elves still don't get along almost three thousand years later, not that we were ever particularly friendly. Sprites and fairies, werewolves and centaurs, everyone holds a grudge of some sort." 

"Wait, there are centaurs?" 

"Not any more, they were wiped out," she explained with a flourish of her long-fingered hands. "When does this meeting begin? I have to adjudicate a dispute over the bulk purchase of some of the crystals you've flooded the market with." 

"Oh." He didn't know what to say about that. The energy crystals were flying out the door of Eddard's Apothecary and fetching a decent price while doing so. Previously, Reyla had mentioned that it was promoting magic and trade in the territory, he hadn't given thought to possible downsides. 

"Reyla, Chris, everyone," Michelle said as she stuck her head out of her corner office. "Please come into the briefing room, we're all set up." 

They navigated the cubicles side by side, the graceful elf and the enormous dragon. Michelle's team formed up behind as they passed, Pamela bringing up the rear on her crutches. 

Her wound was healing well. Susan had taken a few drops of his blood that morning and used it to make a potent restorative draught for her as soon as she'd gotten to work. Combined with his multiple treatments of saliva during their luxurious days at the Otero family mansion, she hadn't even needed a cast. Chris was amazed, her leg had been ruined. Another week or so and she'd be back to her usual capable, prickly self, according to Dr Chang. 

The large briefing room was once again underutilised, only eight chairs taken once the head of the surveillance department, Carlos Rameca, joined them. 

Finally, the big video conference screen flickered on, and the President himself looked out at them. 

"Well then, let's get this underway," Robert Falconer began. "Thank you all for your hard work, especially the team that went down to that hell hole and took care of it for us. You've earned us a lot of points back with the Brazilians. I'd also like to personally thank you, Lady Narlakis. This office is the first in the country to be established and operational thanks to your stewardship." 

"You're welcome." Reyla inclined her head. 

"On to business then," Michelle nudged. "Mr President, you've read the action report I sent you. Did you get a chance to view some of the footage?" 

"I did, Agent Hamund, it's sobering stuff. I wouldn't like to think about that sort of thing happening in a major population centre. Good thing you brought young Christopher along with you." 

"Yes, we are fortunate to have him on our side, but what do you think of my proposal? The extra manpower and assets could be vital if we're going to be policing more than just our own country." 

Chris wondered what Michelle had hatched. He glanced at Lisa and Kat, seated stiffly across the table. He got a little shrug from Lisa, this was new to her too apparently. Kat, on the other hand, didn't meet his eyes at all, glancing pointedly at the stark white of the drop-ceiling. Uh oh. 

"The Joint Chiefs are already ahead of you on that. They've had their special forces teams upskilling to deal with Beings for months. I agree though, your input on their projects could be valuable. They might not like you stepping on their toes, but they're big boys. I'll see that you get a seat at the table." 

"And the other thing? I've got good intel that we are leaking like a sieve. Certain individuals and corporations are risking this entire thing. For what? A quick dollar? If this gets to the public, we lose the narrative and all the credibility that goes with it. We have to at least try to push the Revelation forward." 

"I agree." Reyla startled Chris when she spoke in Michelle's support, as if he hadn't already been surprised enough by her bold suggestion. "Not only are you risking your ability to manage your own population, but you'll also make it clear to Beings everywhere that you can't or don't intend to hold your own people accountable. I personally, find it offensive that so little was done to punish Riker Pharmaceutical for their blatantly criminal behaviour. If there are more such incidents, the Being population will find out. They will call for war." 

Chris looked straight ahead, his pulse rising rapidly. He was in a room with trained spies, soldiers, and law enforcement and he had a dirty little Mediterranean secret to keep. He dared not even glance at Michelle. 

"I wish it were as simple as just bringing the date forward, ladies, I really do." The president took off his reading glasses and rocked back in his chair. "But we all know that wouldn't magically solve our problems. Sorry, no pun intended. Huh, my daughter would fine me for that one. What I meant is that we simply aren't ready, and our allies around the world are dragging the chain. I can raise the issue at the upcoming summit at the United Nations, but it won't get traction. Half of my own government will oppose it anyway." 

"Then you must loosen our leashes, Mr President," Reyla advised with a sly little smile. "Beings are no use to you hamstrung as we are now. We could help take care of all sorts of little problems for you, if you let us." 

"It would reflect very poorly if I unleashed Beings on anyone who gets in the way," he contemplated carefully. "I certainly won't give you licence to use the memory charm." 

"Ung," Reyla let out a little grunt of disgust. "A pity you have such an irrational dislike for such a useful spell. You spend huge sums on incarcerating criminals that could easily be reconditioned to a docile, skilled workforce. But, that is beside the point. We have other, less distasteful cards we can play. Our young dragon here can devour entire buildings and launch them out of orbit. I'm sure there are more subtle ways we can come up with to discourage your privateering corporate wrongdoers." 

Chris was really starting to suspect the two women were colluding now. Clever girls. 

"I agree," Michelle said, adding her support before the President could think to object. "It amounts to intimidation, but there are plenty of ways we could magically convey the message to back off. Who's going to say boo, they'll sound crazy if they try to convince people they're being harassed by a dragon or a vampire." 

"Alright, you've convinced me," the President surrendered. "I get it. If they don't play by the rules, we won't either. I don't want to know any further details, but please be circumspect about it. What do we know about the cause of the incident in Brazil?" 

"Chris?" Michelle prompted, starting him from imagined ways to terrorise greedy executives for approving kidnapping and murder. A perfect sphere missing from the engine block in their cars was his best idea so far. 

"Well, it was Radek," he recovered. "I thought that was obvious." 

"According to agent Hamund's report, you somehow 'smelled or tasted his corrupt magic,' is that correct?" the President asked, a slightly salted eyebrow rising. "No one saw the man on the scene, and evidence suggests that the handprint wasn't human at all. How do we really know he was responsible?" 

"He was there," Chris rumbled, doing his best to remain respectful. "I did smell him, or his magic at least." 

"I'm not trying to insinuate you're wrong, Christopher." Robert's expression softened. "Just that we need to be sure. You'll forgive me if sense of smell isn't what I usually get presented with as evidence of wrongdoing." 

Sam shifted nervously beside him, she knew the leader of the nation's scrutiny was not aimed at her but the young man beside her. It was intimidating nonetheless. 

"I would trust the dragon on this," Reyla spoke in his support. "Chris has faced Radek before, and a dragon's senses are very keen. I have reviewed the footage also, and I believe we may be dealing with some sort of very ancient... entity. The magic was truly heinous, I have never seen its like." 

Chris' eyes narrowed, she definitely knew something. He'd suspected for a while, but the way she walked on eggshells around the issue now just confirmed it. The elf must have sensed his ire because her long, ears gave a telling little twitch and her grey eyes shot to him guiltily for a microsecond. 

"Well, that's not what I wanted to hear," the President sighed. 

"I don't think this was an isolated occurrence either," Michelle said. "I've reanalysed some of the incidents that our systems picked up in Central America. There have been several cases of multiple murders or disappearances of entire households or farmsteads. In all cases, the bodies were found in an advanced state of decay or burned. At the time, they looked mundane, but after what I saw in Brazil, I now suspect they could be Radek's work, simply allowed to run its course for a few more days before they were discovered." 

"Shit, he's working his way down the continent," Robert said. 

"Exactly." 

"Why?" 

There was a pause, people began glancing at each other until more and more pairs of eyes settled on Chris. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
"Well, I don't know." He shot a reproachful look at the elf who had apparently abandoned him on the subject. They would have to have another little chat about honesty soon, and they'd been making such good progress. "Whatever it is he's up to, we have to stop him. It can't be good." 

"The Brazilians have set up border checkpoints, but I'm not confident they'll do any good," Michelle moved them along. "All we have to distribute is his description and that he's extremely dangerous. Our best case in that scenario is that he's recognised and causes enough damage in his attempt to escape that it puts him back on our radar. Though what happens then is anyone's guess." 

"The Synod has their own ongoing investigation," Relya addressed the President. "That may be our best chance to stop him, but they have their own problems to deal with. He hasn't been their top priority since he disappeared after the incident in Harrisburg." 

"He hasn't been ours either," the President admitted. "We've been distracted trying to prepare for the Revelation." 

"Which was his plan all along," Lisa spoke unexpectedly, sitting straighter in her chair. "I've read the files. Whatever he's planning, he engineered this whole situation to distract us from whatever he's doing now." 

"I agree, Lisa," Chris nodded approvingly to the brunette. 

"We need to devote more resources to this, Michelle," Robert Falconer agreed. "Put some people on it if you can spare them. Anything you can do to help, Lady Reyla, would be greatly appreciated." 

"Of course," the dark elf inclined her graceful neck. 

"Okay, I've got to get going in a minute," the President wrapped up, looking at his watch. "One final thing, I'd like Chris at the upcoming UN summit. It's a secret, but key leaders will be ratifying the draft terms of the Revelation. I know the Synod delegation will be there but to be frank, I'd like someone I can trust nearby. It's too delicate not to take precautions against trouble. Bring whoever you like, it will be a good chance to meet in person. What do you say, Chris?" 

"Oh... Yes, of course, Sir. Are you sure it's not a little too public?" he asked. The logic of having him there was sound, but he was nervous about the publicity of such a high-profile meeting. There was bound to be a lot of press coverage. 

"It's the perfect chance to foreshadow your appearance in the media," Michelle assured him. "It will be fine." 

"Folks, I've got to go," the President glanced up off-camera as someone gestured for his attention. "Thank you for your time and especially your hard work and bravery. Keep me updated." 

A curious mix of goodbyes, salutes, and nods bid the man farewell before the connection cut off. 

"Very well," Michelle collected a few documents she'd put out on the desk and began packing them into her laptop case. "Back to it, people. I'll update your assignments over the next few hours." 

Everyone else rose and began filling slowly out of the room, conscious of the tension between the dragon and the elf. 

"Reyla," Chris finally spoke, controlling any trace of emotion. "I wouldn't mind a chance to discuss the events in Brazil, there must be something you can add to my understanding of the magic involved. Anything at all you can shed light on would be... appreciated. When you have time, of course." 

"Yes. Yes, of course, dragon, I'll check my schedule. Good day." The elf beat a dignified, if slightly hasty retreat. The dragon was onto her, and this was not the place for that particular discussion. 

Chris let out a little growl of frustration as she slid away. He moved to leave as well when Michelle stopped him. 

"Chris, please come see me in my office for lunch." 

*** 

Kat looked up from her screen as Chris hulked his way past her desk. She couldn't look at him the same way after what she'd seen. After... she shivered. His enormous, glistening cock wrenching free of Michelle, bucking, firing a pearly salvo to arc and splatter and... enough. 

His butt looked damn fine in that pair of jeans as he walked to the door of Michelle's corner office and knocked. It had looked even better naked and working. 

"Come in, Chris." Michelle opened the door and ushered him inside with a smile. 

He smiled back, noting her demeanour seemed less aloof. The soft click as she quietly locked the door widened his grin. 

"Have a seat," she said without turning, her attention on rolling the blinds down across the window that looked out over her pen of investigators, data miners, hackers, and soldiers. 

Instead, he took three silent steps so he stood directly behind her. She was too busy trying to peep through a tiny gap to see if anyone had noticed her unusual behaviour. 

"You've been avoiding me," he whispered warm against her neck, delighting in his predatory nature. 

To her credit, she didn't jump or squeal or even turn her head. She quivered, like a hare in hiding, ready to leap away if the hounds came too close. He leaned closer, running his nose into her short black hair, scenting her. His large hands settled gently on her hips over her snug fitting suit pants. 

"Chris I...eek!" 

He spun her, sweeping her up into a hug without warning, easily lifting her into his arms. She looked slightly down at him now as he carefully squeezed her, unable to help the tenderness that grew in her expressive brown eyes. Her hands automatically fell on his neck, caressing as they communicated with just their looks and touches. 

"Why the cold shoulder?" he finally asked, raising the question that had been bothering him ever since Brazil. 

"I... Chris," she paused, tracing a finger over the shell of his ear. "We need to be professional. I can't have a public relationship with you." 

"I see." 

He didn't, of course. One incredible, steamy encounter and it was like they'd gone back to square one with their friendship. He slowly set Michelle down on her feet. 

"No, you don't," she smiled sadly, laying her head on his deliciously muscled chest instead of stepping out of his loosening embrace. Her arms attempted to encircle him in return and failed as she breathed in his spicy musk. "I can't jeopardise all I've worked toward here for the sake of a little PDA. I can't kiss you, hug you, or even glance at you funny around my colleagues, Chris, even if I might want to. It's bad enough that Kat knows what we're up to. She said she'd keep her mouth shut, but if it got out, it could be grounds to transfer me or bust me down a few levels. I need to be the one holding the reins on this agency." 

"They would seriously bust your ass over us?" he frowned. Humans were fucking crazy. With a start, he realised his unconscious change in perspective. The dragon was winning out. 

"Maybe," she sighed. "Someone ambitious might call my leadership into question over it, certainly. It is unprofessional. I'm technically your direct superior." 

"Questionable," he chuckled down at her. 

"You know what I mean," she bumped her chin into his pectoral as a beautiful smile finally settled on her lips. 

He wanted to kiss her, but his stomach gurgled in protest, sounding like some caged abyssal horror. It was feeding time. 

Michelle actually started in fright, feeling the rumble through their embrace. 

"Come on, let's go get something to eat before I'm devoured from the inside." 

"Kiss me first," she leaned up on her toes, needing to reassure him. 

"But I thought..." 

"Are we in public?" 

Soft, warm, and breathy, her lips met his eagerly. They moulded perfectly, drawing a rumbling purr from his chest as she teased him with a pulling nip of her teeth. His hands roamed up her back against the cotton of her shirt as their tongues finally met in slippery passion. He watched her eyelids flutter, an avid little noise rising in her throat. 

When they finally parted, both were grinning stupidly. 

They emerged from her office spaced appropriately apart and took the elevator down to the street. It was cool, but the sun was out. It wasn't too windy, all in all, not a bad late autumn day. 

"Look at them all," he gestured to the oblivious pedestrians they passed, intent on their destinations, their phones, or their walking partners. Mostly their phones. "It's all going to come crashing down around them in a few more months." 

"It needs to be sooner," she replied. "Some of them could use a shakeup. But it shouldn't be as bad as all that. There are so few Beings compared to humans, most people will never even meet one." 

"That's a disturbing thought," Chris admitted, pausing to let a group of students pass unhindered by his broad shoulders. "We need to make a good impression then. It'll be too easy to dehumanise us." 

"You'll be fine," she teased, poking his side. "You make a good impression on everyone. Even the President loves you." 

"Huh, and look where that's landed me," he grumbled. "Stuck in a government job with a terrible boss who's always taking advantage of me." 

"You're lucky we're in public." 

He smiled. 

"So how exactly is this going to work, Michelle?" 

"It's simple, anything outside the house is completely professional. But when I get home, we're... fuck-buddies?" 

"Fuck buddies?" he laughed heartily, causing a few heads to turn his way in disapproval. "And what about what just happened up in your office?" 

"Momentary lapse in judgement," she replied with mock contrition. "Won't happen again." 

"Is that so?" he challenged as they arrived at their destination. 

"Yup. But when I get home tonight, I'm going to ride your face until you've got carpet burn. You owe me after the number that monster of yours pulled on me." 

"Michelle, I..." 

"Shut up, I loved every minute of it," she shot back. 

He held the door open for her, his grin wide and lecherous. A delicious warm smell wafted out onto the street. The dragon's stomach protested the tantalising odours of the Japanese kitchen loudly, hurrying them both inside. 

Chris had been there before and fallen in love with their crumbed pork cutlet. He asked the waiter if they could have a booth at the back and were soon perusing the menu. 

"Hailey and I have been scheming up some ideas," he said as the server left with their order. 

"Lisa told me about your quarry incident. Be careful, please." 

"I will," he paused to take a sip of water. "I just wanted to let you know in case someone notices when I start playing around." 

"Nothing too dramatic, I hope," she frowned across the booth. "There's a lot at risk." 

"I know, but I feel like I need to make a start. There's a lot that needs fixing. Speaking of which, do you have anyone on your naughty list yet? That was quite the crafty little play you organised with Reyla. I almost feel sorry for Robert with you two ganging up like that." 

"It's just politics," she shrugged, that impishly smile on her enticing lips. "If I'm going to play, I'll play smart. The President might seem all full of confidence, but I think the footage of Brazil gave him a bit of a wake-up call. If he won't try to move up the Revelation, I'll capitalise on his fears to get us more slack. We need more leeway for using magic, and if I don't get firmly inside the military's pants now, they'll start competing with us." 

"You're incredible you know?" He rested his chin in his hands, staring puppy-like into her eyes. 

"Stop that. Now, I've been searching through the data I collected from you-know-who's computers. A couple of his acquaintances could use a lump of coal and a switching if you get my drift." 

"I think I do," he agreed. "A visit from dragon-santa then. Can I wear a costume?" 

"Oh god!" Michelle laughed. "Please don't." 

"What? It could be a good disguise." 

"I don't think I'd be able to look at a Santa again after seeing one with big cream and purple wings, talons, and a dragonified face. You'd look like a jolly devil." 

"See, perfect for what we've got planned. There's a bigger problem though. I think I need to start travelling to different spots around the globe in order to build a library of places I can jump to. It's a serious limitation if we have to keep relying on the jet to go places, even if I do love the thing." 

"You're right, that would be very useful." She reached across the dark wood of the table to squeeze his hand. "But please, Chris, don't take on too much." 

"I'll be fine," he winked back at her, full of burgeoning love and anticipation for the delights of her eager athleticism. He was wondering if they might get away with leaning across to share a kiss when their food arrived. 

Said arrival spelled the death of their conversation, for the ravenous dragon attacked dish after dish until nothing was left. Michelle couldn't help wondering if it was his prodigious appetite that kept him overflowing with magic, all that food had to be going somewhere. 

*** 

In the Ether, the depths of the Compound were one of the liveliest natural environments he'd encountered yet. Maybe not so much with the scuttling, hovering, or lurking critters he was beginning to recognise elsewhere, but with magic. 

Every corridor, wall, and door was touched by arcane energy. Complex chains of runic symbols for strength and integrity graced the ceiling with almost mathematical precision every forty or so paces. Unknown spells surrounded door frames with elegant script, whether as simple magical locking mechanisms or to incinerate intruders, he couldn't guess. Anything in between seemed possible. A few plantlike denizens clung to the walls or found purchase in corners here and there, but overall, the Ether environment was very well tended. 

He stalked his prey through the crowded corridors at the end of the working day, the drow who was still keeping secrets. The evidence of magic all around him drove home the elf's hard work and dedication to building her underground empire. He paused his hunt, leaning against a ghostly wall as two witches passed obliviously in the other direction, their heads bent together in hushed whispering. There was no real need to step out of the way, but it seemed a little rude to pass directly through the shadow of another Being when there was no pressing reason. 

Reyla was an enigma to him. When it came down to it, he knew almost nothing about her history. Sure, she was nearly two thousand years old, everyone knew that. But where had she grown up? What magic did she favour? Did she have a family? How long had she been Lady of the Midwest? These and many other meaningful questions had never come up before. The realisation spread a thoughtful frown across his brow. 

What had he learned so far? She was undoubtedly cold, calculating, and a skilled navigator of politics and psychology. Her ruthlessness and temper were legendary, and it was known that she 'collected' useful Beings to surround herself. Her relationship with Lillian showed that her scruples were somewhat lacking once someone was under her control or in her debt. Was he falling into her web? No, he thought not. If anything, their power dynamic was shifting in his favour. He thought he'd been making good progress cracking the shell of her defences. Beneath, he suspected he would find a very lonely, unfulfilled woman despite all her collected wealth and power. 

The anger he'd worked up over the afternoon scribbling at his desk and writing up his after action report slowly drained. He would not pounce on Reyla from the Ether, demanding answers. She deserved a chance to explain her deceit in this matter, he owed her more respect after the hospitality she'd shown him. 

He merged back into the Norm with a quiet pop, causing the conspiring witches to turn, delivering their best affronted glares. He ignored them, retracing his steps. Whatever she was up to down here in the lower levels was her business. He would wait rather than interrupt her. Not somewhere he could be ignored or put off though, he needed answers now. 

The corridor leading to her study was a dead end as far as he knew, branching from a busier passageway that led to the offices of a few of her administrators. So, he took a post at the junction and waited. After perhaps ten minutes, he sat, finding a comfortable position with his back against the cold stone wall. 

A state of restful alertness slowly enveloped him. His eyes closed and his mind slowed. He didn't sleep, his senses were still alert to the occasional passerby. Several paused, startled by the strange sight and the need to navigate the draconian obstruction to be about their business. It amused him to imagine how they gathered courage before scampering by like there was any real possibility that he might lash out. Some just turned and went back the way they come, as if his very presence was an impassable barrier. How absurd. 

Humour got the better of him eventually, to the detriment of one unfortunate member of the custodial staff. A young feline shifter by the smell of her. It had taken minutes of shuffling nervously from foot to foot to finally work herself up to get around him with her cart of supplies. 

"Boo," he said quietly just as she got by. Her resulting shriek and headlong flight brought him entirely too much simple joy. Had she really convinced herself that he was asleep? 

He suspected word of his vigil would spread around the Compound soon enough. 

At some point, Arvil slipped out of the nearby study. 

"So, that explains the absence of my sweet briarthorn tea," the elf observed with a dry chuckle. "Must you block half the corridor like some overbearing gargoyle?" 

"I'm afraid so," Chris opened one eye and grinned up at the brown-skinned elf. "Your cousin has been keeping something from me, and I intend to have some answers. Plus, I'm having too much fun to stop now. Unless, of course, you'd like to tell me what you've discovered about Radek?" 

"Ahh, I see. No, I think I'll let her deal with this," he said warily, edging around the dragon just like the others. 

"What's the matter, Arvil?" 

"Nothing, nothing my boy," he laughed shakily. The elf actually seemed nervous. "Must be off to the kitchens for my tea though, helps with my headaches you know. Too much reading. As you were, I'm sure my cousin will arrive shortly." 

"Sure," Chris smiled, playing his part perfectly. "I'm not going anywhere." 

Almost silent footsteps on the lush carpet heralded Reyla's arrival when she did eventually appear. A quiet sigh of exasperation confirmed her identity. He stood to face her. 

"Did you really need to terrorise my staff, dragon?" she tutted her mild annoyance, one hand on her slim hip. She was still wearing the lovely flowing gown he'd seen her in that morning, the blue fabric moulding to her tall figure wonderfully. 

"Did you really need to lie to me?" he countered. "You've known something about Radek this whole time, I'm sure of it." 

"I didn't lie," her chin rose defiantly, and she took on a practised, haughty air as she began walking toward him. 

He shook his head at her antics. It was almost as if she was the one offended by his accusation. 

"Enough!" he barked, drawing her up a few meters away from him. They squared off in the corridor as he moved to block her path. "No more games, Reyla. Lying by omission is still lying, no matter how you justify it. I thought we were making progress on trusting each other, but you have been holding back your cards this whole time. Tell me everything, explain it to me like I'm a child if you have to. What do you know about Radek and why have you kept me in the dark?" 

"Chris, it's not that easy..." 

"Stop," he closed his eyes, breathing deep to stem his growing frustration. "If you value our relationship, stop. This is your last chance. Come clean about Radek, about anything else you think might concern me or mine. I am a simple man, I won't deal in lies or deceits or with anyone who tries to sell them to me." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
She studied his face, finding something akin to sadness there. Disappointment? Her reasons for keeping her suspicions to herself seemed almost petty now, if she'd lost the trust of this dragon, this... Devine. Despite her best intentions, perhaps she had erred. 

"Very well, come with me." She brushed past him, a slender black-padded finger tracing lightly across his strapping forearm. 

He turned to follow, surprised that she breezed straight past her study and down the corridor. Her gently swaying hips were naturally enticing to his eyes, but he tried to keep his mind focused, he needed all his mental fortitude to wrangle with this eel of a woman. 

Around a sharp bend, the passageway ended abruptly in a rough-hewn wooden door. Conspicuous runes were charred into the thick planks of cedar, contrastingly dark against the beautiful reddish grain full of knots and imperfections. There was no door handle to admit them, but Reyla placed her palm on the wood and caressed downward. It shivered under her almost sensual touch, swinging open without so much as a push. 

Chris paused on the threshold as she walked confidently into a small, intimate room that was apparently her personal quarters. He hadn't expected this. 

"Come in," she turned, beckoning him past a fireplace that began to crackle with renewed life, perhaps sensing the presence of its mistress. "Have a seat. I'm going to change into something more comfortable, my feet are sore." 

Apparently nonchalant about leaving him in her little living room, she opened another door and disappeared. Whether on purpose or not, that door stayed open even as the one behind him swung silently shut. Beyond, he caught a glimpse of a huge four poster bed, draped with thick blinds. She disappeared behind an ornate changing screen, and he looked away in embarrassment. 

The little living room was a curious window into her private life. It was not at all what he'd expected. What had he expected? Certainly not tiny, efficient, dark, warm, and... homely? A well-worn leather armchair sat next to the open fire, a soft blue blanket draped across its seat and backrest. Beside the chair, a box of cut wood waited ready for the fireplace. 

Of course, a bookshelf dominated the entire room and was filled to overflowing with what he assumed were her most treasured texts. So great was her love for the tomes that they were crammed into every available space, stacked almost perilously on the mantelpiece, and even stockpiled on the floor. The small table in the middle of the room was half covered with them as well. They teetered precariously in huge mottled piles, rising like uneven skyscrapers, towering over dark alleys below. It was a wonder the thing hadn't collapsed under the weight. The other end of the table was clearly her workspace, several books stood propped open or positioned on reading stands where she'd left them. 

A solitary light orb glowed softly in the low, domed ceiling. Its light could be supplemented by various unlit candles placed haphazardly around the room. 

There was just one of everything, he realised. One armchair, one seat at the table, one set of utensils laid neatly beside the tiny sink in the far corner. 

Curiosity forced him to move over and examine the little kitchenette. He frowned, it could barely be called that. Just a sink, an earthen mug, a kettle for the fire, and a few shelves of dried herbs jars of sweets. What a solitary existence she led. 

There was another narrow doorway beside against the wall here, with a handle this time. Internally, the debate only raged for a few moments. Curiosity got the better of him again, and he reached for it. 

"It's mostly just books," Reyla said from behind him. 

He whirled, red embarrassment rising in his cheeks. 

"Sorry, I was... This isn't at all what I imagined." 

She was barefoot, in her loose silken nightclothes once again. 

"No matter. Excuse the mess." She motioned to the books on the table. "I'm going to prepare a warm drink, would you like one? I have... oh. I have only one cup, sorry." 

"No, it's fine. I came for answers, not beverages." 

"Very well," she said, brushing past him in the confined space. 

He stepped back, almost tripping himself with the wooden chair positioned by her table reading station. The brass kettle was soon filled with water, and she turned back to the fire, hooking it over a sooty rod, so it was suspended over the dancing flames. 

"You don't have electricity down here," he noted aloud, thinking more to himself than meaning to speak the words. 

"Appliances are too loud," she replied, running a finger disapprovingly through the thin layer of dust encroaching on the wooden mantlepiece. "They disturb me when I'm reading or trying to sleep. My quarters are actually modelled after the rooms I grew up with in my house's Keep. Their familiarity is comforting." 

"Your Keep? I would like to see how the Drow live one day." 

"Ha! I don't think you'll be invited to any elven strongholds after the way you dealt with House Lefayd. Although," she considered him across the table piled with books. "My Matriarch might consider you a hero for putting them in their place." 

Chris winced. 

"I may have gotten a little carried away. Is there likely to be any backlash against me? Susan has prepared a restorative potion with some of my own blood, I was wondering if you could arrange some to be delivered to the elf who's tongue I... liberated." 

"Have a seat, dragon. We may be here a while," she gestured to the small chair even as she took the much more comfortable armchair for herself. It was her room after all. "Hmm, I could arrange for the delivery of the potion, your reptilian nature would indeed be excellent for growing things back. I warn you though, it might not be accepted. I have heard that House Lefayd is furious, partly with you, mostly with themselves I think. They are ruined politically. The Synod has turned on Eramir at the behest of the vampires, he is in custody awaiting trial. They voted yesterday to administer truth syrup. I think he will find himself in Atlantis Prison for at least fifty years but who knows what else they'll discover during questioning. It remains to be seen if you will be shackled with reparations for the damages to Lefayd's property. I doubt it, seeing as you didn't kill anyone with that explosion. That was lucky, you have quite the temper. We share that at least." 

"Indeed we do," he nodded. "Well, I'll count myself lucky if things work out as you've said." 

"I would watch my back if I were you," she warned. "We talked about long memories this morning. Elves have some of the longest. Do not be surprised if you find a dagger protruding from your back in a thousand years and a Lefayd assassin whispering their regards in your ear." 

Chris growled, his anger rising at the very notion. 

"Peace, I am simply warning you to be vigilant. Now, you put on that performance out there because you want the truth about Radek?" 

"Yes," he calmed himself. 

"I don't have truth for you, dragon," she sighed, glancing away from his intense gaze. How was he going to react? He was touched by the Old Gods after all. 

"What?" 

"I have only a suspicion, though it grows closer to a certainty with every scrap of information we gather." 

"A suspicion?!" he asked incredulously, running a frustrated hand through his hair. "I find that hard to believe. You've been holding something back on the subject for a while. The Synod has been too reserved about the root of their problems, too. Tell me, Reyla." 

"He may be a demon," she said quietly, shrugging her slender shoulders. 

"A demon? May be?" His disappointment at the elf's elusiveness drained away. "What do you mean a suspicion, is he or isn't he?" 

"Do you need a dictionary, dragon?" A little of her own temper flared. "One does not simply cry demon without proof. The last confirmed presence of one was over four centuries ago, a minor entity at that. Nor has the Synod been inactive. Some of their best are trying to hunt him, the only one who found his trail so far died horribly. You are the only Being who has survived an encounter with Radek. Others seem to die or simply fall under his thrall. At this stage, he is either an incredibly gifted, ancient, and psychotic mage or... a demon." 

"Oh." 

"Yes, oh. Given what I know of your involvement with higher powers and that hideous magic I saw in the footage from Brazil, I lean ever more heavily toward demon. Too many coincidences." 

"Then why did you keep it a secret from me?" he asked, disturbed and exasperated at the same time. 

"Because before a few days ago, I was convincing myself that it couldn't be true," she answered in a short tone. "You do not even understand the significance of a demonic presence, do you? What exactly would you have done with this unverified, potentially explosive information, hmm?" 

"I don't know," he said honestly. 

"And how do you think Beings would react if they found out the Revelation was orchestrated, being forced on us by a bloody-damned demon?!" 

"Not well, I assume." 

The kettle bubbled up with a hiss, water overflowing the spout to douse the rosy embers below with a hiss. The distraction took the steam out of the elf's own boiler. For a few minutes, they were both silent. Chris battled a mounting sense of panic, foreboding, and helplessness as he began connecting the dots. 

Reyla took the hot kettle carefully back to the sink, setting it aside for a moment as she spooned a calming mix of dried herbs into her small teapot. A spoonful of honey followed before she poured the hot water over the top, releasing the pleasant scent of jasmine into the room. 

"It would be an unmitigated disaster," she turned, finding him with his head in his hands, brought low by yet another burden it seemed. 

"Arrrrgg! What does it mean?" he croaked, his voice thick with pent-up emotion. "Why me? What am I supposed to do?" 

"Oh, dragon..." she took the few steps to close the distance between them, pulling his head into her tummy, holding him. She hadn't meant for him to suffer from this. For a few moments, she just enjoyed touching him for the first time, running her fingers over his thick neck, through his short, messy hair. Finally, as his breathing became steady once more, she tugged lightly on his ears until he raised his face to look up at her. "If he is a demon, we will find the creature and kill it, of course." 

"As simple as that?" he chuckled wryly, his chin still resting on the thin silk covering her sylphlike lower abdomen. 

"The simple plans are always the best," she said, patting his head almost maternally. Catching herself, she stepped away before they fell any further down the slippery mountainside of intimacy. Her tea was nearly ready. 

The moment was not lost on Chris. Reyla could be gentle it seemed, and he had needed the comfort. The scent of her body and the lilac infused soap she'd used that morning still tingled in his nostrils. 

"Thank you, Reyla. It's overwhelming to think that I must be connected to this somehow, that it's my responsibility to deal with Radek. I suppose in some ways I've felt it but... I just wish I knew what I was doing. Is that too much to ask from whatever chose to change me, to give me this power?" 

They regarded each other in cautious silence for a few heartbeats until she flicked an errant strand of white hair over her long ear and turned to pour herself a steaming, fragrant cup. With her back turned, she voiced her thoughts. 

"If there's anything I have learned for certain about the Devine, it is that they are just as fallible as the rest of us, Chris," she spoke softly, pouring into her lone, fired-clay mug. "Though their power outstripped our understanding, they still fought a war, still killed and died, still made mistakes, still had stupid laws which lead to the meaningless deaths of thousands of us. And it would appear their great Barrier still lets terrible things slip through every now and then. We might have worshipped them in the zealous youth of our time on this planet, but they were never omnipotent. You have a wonderful power, a rare gift to be sure, but dealing with a demon loose in our world is not your responsibility alone. I will help you and others will too." 

"Thank you. That is at least a little reassuring," he breathed, some of the weight of responsibility lifting, if only for a few moments. "Not the part about Devines being fallible though. What were they fighting over? What even are demons?" 

She put the mug to her dark lips and took a careful sip, considering her answer. 

"I am almost certain the few demons to find a way through the Barrier over the last few thousand years have been lowly creatures. Though powerful by our standards, they must pale in comparison to the entities that battled with the Old Gods. I cannot say why they fought, I had hoped you might shed some light there, but alas, it seems that is not to be. Whatever demons are, they obsess with growing, with gaining power by consuming all around them, including each other. I have read that on the battlefield, it was not uncommon for a demon general to devour an officer who couldn't complete his tasks. They disposed of their wounded in a similarly inhumane way. But, there is the heart of what makes a demon. They consume energy, especially life and the concentration of magic associated with such high complexity. I have been told that sentients are especially nutritious." 

"The village..." he murmured. 

"Yes, indeed. That is why I am now almost certain that Radek is a demon, I think they were reaped... like a crop of ripe grain." Reyla shuddered at the thought, blowing on the surface of her tea. 

"Well? What do we do about it?" he asked, almost accidentally knocking one of her books off the table with a frustrated swipe of his hand. 

"Ahh, there lies a non-trivial problem. All investigations pertaining to demonic activity are the strict purview of the Synod. More specifically, that fairy bitch, Queen Magdalen. Strictly speaking, what you did down there was interfering with her investigation. Nothing will come of it because you didn't go down there to hunt him, but I'm required to pass on all the information you gathered." 

"You've got to be kidding me. So what? Now we sit back and do nothing?" 

"I didn't say that," the elf grinned wickedly, her ears twitching. "But we must be cautious with our plan. For a start, we will use your Familiar to hunt him. The humans have some impressive technology, I think they might surprise us. Magdalen cannot reasonably stop them without revealing that they suspect he is a demon. Who knows what trouble that would cause." 

"I don't even want to think about it," Chris rubbed at his temples. "The word is too religiously charged, we're already going to be branded as devil-spawn by half the world as it is." 

"Exactly. The reaction amongst the Being population would be no less disastrous. In the past, the lower classes have been known to band together and openly run down demons out of fear, regardless of human collateral damage or the Synod's orders."  

"Shit, do we have options?" 

"I have another, less diplomatic, avenue we might explore. I would need your help to break into certain vaults to obtain rare texts that might contain spells to locate demons, amongst other things. That would be our last resort though, the consequences would be dire. There is still a good chance that the Synod can handle him themselves, though it doesn't help that they're so distracted of late. You haven't helped either. Magdalen was one of Eramir's firmest allies, and now she is busy maneuvering to keep her seat." 

"What a mess." He slowly stood, his head coming close to the slightly domed ceiling. Suddenly the desire to get home was strong inside him, to seek reassurance and normalcy in the love of his brood. "You've given me a lot to think about." 

"Think nothing of it," Reyla almost purred, taking another languid sip from her comfortable seat as he moved toward the door. "You see why I have been discrete, then? Our suspicions about his nature mustn't become common knowledge." 

"Yes, I understand. You need to consider telling Michelle though, she'll be much more effective if she knows what she's looking for." 

"I have considered it, but wouldn't she be obliged to report this to her superiors?" Reyla asked. 

"Maybe," he sighed resignedly. "She certainly wouldn't appreciate being put in that position. She'll be furious if she's lied to though. I was." 

"I'm sorry." Her head bowed in contrition, fine white hair flowing down from behind her ears to partially obscure her elegant face. Yet another gesture of deference which was probably rare for her, he thought. "When I first decided to conceal my thoughts on the matter, I considered them hardly more than a fearful fancy. It seemed so improbable, the arrival of any demon through the Barrier is easily detected. The Synod's hunters converge and a short, sometimes bloody struggle ensues before the demon is dispatched. I still have no idea how Radek slipped past our detection." 

"I guess we'll have to ask him one day." 

"Be serious, Chris. What will you do, now that you have the burden of this knowledge?" 

"I truly don't know, probably nothing. Though the idea of marshalling an army of Beings and sweeping down the continent until we've flushed him into the sea does seem appealing. For now, I think I'll go home and find a way to distract myself." 

"A dragon through and through," Reyla smiled, it might be nice to entertain him a while longer and move to other topics, but he was ready to leave. A flick of her wrist opened the thick door to the corridor outside. "You have done all that could possibly be expected of you so far. Be at peace, Chris. Simply continue to gather knowledge and strength so that you may act if the opportunity presents itself." 

"Thank you," he turned in the portal. "Sorry about the drama before, I didn't... Still friends?" 

"Of course." 

*** 

He did not return to the domestic bliss he so desperately sought after the frustrating conversation with Reyla. Raised voices in the apartment put him on alert as soon as he phased into his bedroom. Though muffled, a heated argument appeared to be underway in the borrowed hotel suite. 

He knew that he shouldn't, but it didn't stop him creeping silently to the door, listening all the while. 

"It's not that big a deal," Susan said, clearly trying to calm the situation. "I'll just miss out this cycle, no one else will get put out." 

"No!" Annabel growled, followed by a dull thump that Chris would swear was her foot stomping the floor in outrage. So Annabel was adorably angry then, that couldn't be good. "Lillian you're throwing your weight around again. This will be the third time you've broken the schedule, it's just not fair for everyone." 

"Mother and I agree," Claire spoke firmly in his First's defence. 

"You don't understand, Annabel. I need this, I need him," the vampire growled, her voice containing much more darkness than Chris expected. "I will have him tonight. You will have to stop me by force." 

"Here we go," he muttered, turning the door handle to step quickly inside before things soured any further. 

All eyes turned to him, so many pretty faces set in relief, worry, love, concern, mischief, longing, and finally, feral hunger. 

Lillian practically launched herself across the table at him, eyes black and full of promised death. It took all his mental fortitude to stand firm, bracing himself to receive the jarring impact that came half a second later. She coiled around him like a python, her pencil skirt ripping up the seams as her lush thighs encircled his waist. The fabric was no match for her undead strength, and he didn't bother resisting her lest he meet the same fate. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 6|
--------------------------------------------
Her warm lips found his neck, followed by her fangs. Strong arms slipping around his shoulders, the vampire squeezed him like an almost empty tube of toothpaste. She moaned in satisfaction as he splashed hot and nourishing across her tongue. 

"Miss me, beautiful?" he teased, kissing into the chestnut hair flowing over her neck as she fed. Chris chuckled when she didn't respond, putting his hands under her large thighs for support as he finally spared a glance around at the other women in the room, realising that both Hailey and Michelle were witness to the spectacle. 

"Well, thank goodness you arrived. She was becoming downright scary," Claire sounded both relieved, and a little humorous. 

"She's done this before?" Chris asked, rubbing a hand up and down his thirsty vampire's spine as she fed slowly, contentedly. At least she was learning constraint there. The strange experience was much more pleasant when she didn't latch on like an industrial vacuum cleaner. "I heard some of the argument, you guys were pretty loud." 

"Yeah, she's jumped the queue a few times," Annabel moved closer to the pair cautiously. "I've never seen her as bad as that though, her eyes were almost black." 

"She must be quite hungry," Petra agreed, looking stunning as ever as she sat at the kitchen bar in a dark blue dress that couldn't make up its mind if it wanted to be a negligee or not. 

"You should have just agreed with her," Susan tutted from the kitchen. "It's not worth the risk. Vampires can go a little crazy when they're starving." 

"She's probably right, Annabel," Chris agreed, even as said vampire harrumphed quietly against his skin, showing she was at least still attending the conversation. "Lillian's need is almost medical when she's truly hungry, she does require some special access at times." 

"Okay, I understand that, but I'm just worried that we are beginning to form a pattern of her bullying her way into extra nights with you." 

"That's also a valid point," he admitted. "And we're going to have to find a solution somehow. I can't have my vampire challenging my First." 

"I think I should be in charge of punishment!" Immi cackled from a bar stool, her slender blue legs coming nowhere near the floor. 

"Who said anything about punishment?" Chris wondered to himself. 

"You know what?" Annabel grinned wickedly. "I think I like that idea. You can crack the proverbial whip for me, Immi." 

"There's not going to be anything proverbial about it," Immi grinned wickedly as she eyed the greedy vampire. 

"Oh, God," Claire laughed. "You're screwed, Lillian." 

"I'd better be soon if this dragon knows what's good for him," she finally spoke up, nibbling rather firmly at the bulge of his trapezius, the muscle tense as he supported her weight. 

"Ouch! Okay, okay," he set her down and pointed toward the waiting darkness of his bedroom. "Go. I'll be there in a minute." 

She didn't go quickly, making a show of clinging to him before finally allowing him to peel away. The strut she employed in her seemingly reluctant departure was beyond ridiculous, but it still captured his attention like a moth to a flame. The smouldering look she shot over her shoulder as she disappeared set his cock throbbing, pleading to chase after the lusty goddess without delay. 

He looked guiltily back to the other ladies, they'd all seen his eyes follow the vampire. 

"Ahh... No punishments just yet. Sorry, Immi," he recovered. "Did anyone find out how her trip went?" 

"She had to kill someone, but she managed to reign in the hotheads," Michelle spoke up from the living room. "So, that's about as well as expected." 

"You'd better hurry, dinner is almost ready," Annabel sighed, still a little testy about Lillian's disrespect. "I suppose I should just keep yours in the oven?" 

"You're the best. Sorry, Dee," he took her in his arms and kissed her forehead. "Duty calls." 

"More like booty calls," she countered sarcastically. 

Claire's beautiful laughter seemed to melt the darker mood that hung over the women after the confrontation. She joined their embrace, hugging both he and Annabel from the side. Emerald eyes glittered delightedly as her hand expertly found his cloth-trapped erection. 

"Let's not pretend you don't love pounding the shit out of that fat-assed vampire." 

Chin raised, she met his startled look and reached down to his tumescence provocatively. 

"Guilty," he gasped, trying to focus on anything but her teasing. 

"Then don't let her fuck up your pussy ecosystem." 

"My...ec... ecosystem?" he stuttered. 

"Yes." She abandoned his throbbing member and turned to his First. "Annabel, I love you like a... a sister? A great friend? I don't know, we're brood-buddies, right?" 

"Absolutely!" 

"I don't... Lillian's not the same," the young dragoness shrugged, looking back up to Chris to see if he understood. It was tricky to explain. She slipped out of their arms, moving to stand with her mother and stealing a sip of the fresh-squeezed juice she was drinking before continuing. "I don't get the same good vibes from her, and I certainly wouldn't want our kids around when she has a vamp-tantrum." 

She wondered what her mate had to say about that. At least he appeared to be taking a thoughtful moment or two to consider his response. 

His brow furrowed as he finally elevated his gaze to meet both dragoness' concerned looks. The approaching meteoric impact of fatherhood weighed heavily on him, a responsibility from which there was no hiding. 

"I think you'd be surprised, she's very protective. I'll talk to her though, she was out of line today. But you also need to cut her some slack, she's going through a lot." 

"We know, and it's not too bad," Annabel consoled, watching the emotions play across his handsome features. "We're all new at this, Lillian especially." 

"She deserves our patience and support," Petra agreed, nudging her daughter playfully. "It wasn't so long ago that you were the one causing a stir, remember, dear?" 

"It's true," the redhead admitted, her hand resting peacefully on her slightly rounded tummy as her mind raced back to that first glorious afternoon when they'd coupled for hours on end. 

"Bridges?" Annabel asked almost teasingly. 

"Fucking bridges," he smiled ruefully, the upwelling of love he felt for these women making his eyes water for a happy moment. 

"Try giving Lillian a good spanking," Susan tittered, completely shattering his lovestruck musing. "Your father used to do things to his vampire lover that would've had me avoiding chairs for weeks, but the woman seemed to love every second of it if her screams were any way to judge." 

"A spanking, aye?" Chris recovered, catching Annabel around the waist without warning and lifting her off the ground. She shrieked happily as he swept her into the kitchen. "A spanking might work on a good, God-fearing, Laramie girl..." 

"Ahh! Haha, no, don't... stop!" His First half protested, half giggled, slapping at his chest as he manhandled her threateningly. He was all bark though, and she landed breathlessly on her feet only moments later. She sniffed, the first scents of caramelisation drew her focus to the fragrant pots bubbling on her stovetop, and she moved to stir them. 

"My point, is that I hardly think a good spanking is going to resolve the behavioural problems of a five-hundred-year-old vampire courtesan." He flashed a knowing look at Petra, meeting her twinkling green eyes. "So far my experience indicates that she finds it quite pleasurable, so it's just as likely to reinforce bad behaviour." 

"It's all about application," Petra devouring him with her gaze. "Some women respond well to a firm hand and a short leash in the bedroom, even finding it brings a certain peace of mind for the rest of the day. If you know what I mean, lover?" 

The corners of her eyes were so beautiful when she smiled like that, worrying her plump lower lip between white teeth. 

"I think I know exactly what you mean, minx. Don't forget to remind me next time the opportunity presents itself." 

"Mmhh, I can't wait," the blonde dragoness shifted restlessly in her seat. 

"Would anyone else like to volunteer?" he asked cheekily, meeting each woman's eyes in turn. Susan demurred, blushing furiously and Annabel just shook her ass at him and waggled a disapproving finger over her shoulder as she tended to dinner. 

"Me! Me, me, me, me!" Immi almost launched herself into the ceiling with her frantic flapping. 

"Of course you, little one," he laughed. "That was assumed." 

"I'd like to try," Claire admitted "So long as you're not too rough. Hey, you should try giving Lillian some itch, it always makes me all warm and cuddly inside for days." 

"I agree. It's a delightful sensation, for a dragoness at least." A frustrated shriek of impatience echoed through the wall, and Petra laughed. "I think you'd better go see to your vampire before she tears your bedroom apart." 

He decided to sally forth before the lusty creature burst free, and he was forced to suffer the indignity of his brood's instruction as she took him on the kitchen floor. 

"Have fun, babe," Annabel called after him. "But please try to make it quick, we were all going to watch a movie after dinner." 

Chris was almost at the bedroom door when he remembered the two other women. It was only fair that he go check on them too, especially Hailey, who'd only just begun to hang around the suite in the evenings. 

"Hailey, Michelle, sorry about all this. Are you okay?" he asked as he walked back into the living room. 

"I'm fine," Michelle looked up from her tablet, brushing an errant lock of dark hair behind her ear. "That was moderately entertaining, but I guess we'll have to find some other time for that... activity we discussed earlier." 

"I look forward to it," he smiled, turning to the petite blonde and her stack of research papers. "Hailey?" 

"A little shaken," she admitted, a finger holding her place in the additional figures section of an article about the availability of water on Mars. "I swear Lillian's eyes could have sucked the blood right out of me. I don't think it's wise for you two to be away from each other for more than a few days if that's the result." 

"You're absolutely correct. We should have thought about what might happen if either of us was delayed. At the very least, Lillian should have a small bank of my blood put away for emergencies. What are you reading about there?" 

"Oh, it's nothing much," Hailey put the article down entirely to beam up at him. "Just a new study. Nerdy space stuff, you know me. You'd better go see to Lillian. She doesn't strike me as the patient sort." 

"You're right about that too, beautiful," he leaned in and kissed her forehead affectionately. 

*** 

Lillian was a vision, waiting naked for him on the bed, pale skin glowing in the light coming through from the bathroom. Powerful, lithe, and possessing a seemingly bottomless well of sensual confidence, she reminded him of a lazy, big cat waiting to pounce. 

Yet, a darker thing still dwelt in her core. It was there, right behind her laser-focused eyes. The lovely warm hazel colour might have returned with her light feeding, but he knew her inner beast lay close to the surface. Good. 

Pounce she did, as soon as he abandoned his clothes. She practically threw him onto the bed with her telekinetic power. 

The warmth of her smooth thigh on his skin as she straddled him was delightful, making his cock throb and leak. Alabaster curves jiggled delightfully as she settled slowly, purposefully into his lap. Chris watched in awe as her engorged, dewy womanhood spread open with her powerful legs. Finally, the heat of her sex settled onto the thick root of his erection, bathing his weighty balls in the first slippery moisture she dripped. 

He propped himself up and they kissed a little, but he couldn't resist pushing her backward in his lap to worship her bounteous breasts. The large, pebbled areola that topped those pale mountains of soft perfection deserved extra attention. And so, he lapped, sucked, and even grated his teeth gently against her sensitive flesh until her light brown nipples were swollen and she moaned his name in protest. His calloused hands roamed the sexy curves of her lower back, running up her flanks so his thumbs could tease the bulging side-slopes of snowy tit. 

All the while, her smooth, ripe womanhood squirmed up and down along the underside of his throbbing cock, her hips hunching languidly. She looked him straight in the eyes, a fang-filled exhalation of excitement on her lips. 

They both gasped in delight when, with a helping hand, his angry red cockhead finally slipped into her clinging, buttery furrow. With practised ease, she hitched her hips, sitting deeper into his lap as he slid home. Barely half of him was inside when her womanhood seemed to boil over with pleasure. 

"Fuck yessss," she hissed quietly, eyelids fluttering as the sudden climax began to roll over her. 

Chris watched in awe as her thighs quivered, her powerful muscles tensing and spasming as she cried out wordlessly. His throbbing cock was in heaven as she came, awash in her hot nectar. Her inner muscles squeezed him, seeming to urge him deeper. With a grunt, he wrapped his arms around her hourglass waist and forced her downward until her fluttering quim swallowed him completely. It earned him a few scratches across his shoulders, but the weight of her pliant, warm ass finally settled in his lap more than made up for it. 

Eye to eye, Chris leaned forward across her pillowed breasts to kiss her again. His beautiful, pregnant vampire. But the hungry fiend had other, tastier things to wrap her lips around. As they began to fuck, slowly at first, she latched onto the strong, excited pulse of his jugular once more. 

They rocked together, his iron hard cock locked in her slippery, steaming embrace. She surrounded him, sucking him deeper with every caress of hot, pink flesh. They were the perfect sexual match, made for each other, and she cried out as he filled her to the brim. 

When she threw her head back and began an almost guttural keening, he knew her second orgasm was a monster. He held still as she thrashed above him, pulling his head into her cleavage in a credible attempt to drown him in soft, sweaty jiggling. 

He grinned up at her as a gush of warmth spread over his churning testicles and into his lap. Locked in a death grip by her strong arms and rippling womanhood, he let his own fangs grow and carefully sank the very tips into the pale skin just above her pebbled areola. His itch rushed into her bloodstream, its fey magic seeming to extend her climax almost torturously until she pushed him away and rolled to the side. 

His raging cock was rudely abandoned with an audible squelch, glistening and streaked with her fluids. She curled into a ball beside him and shook, overstimulated as enormous aftershocks of pleasure raced through her inundated nerves. 

Chris wasn't anywhere near done with her though, and his throbbing penis demanded its immediate return to her molten embrace. She offered no resistance when he stood and dragged her across the sheets to the corner of the bed. Covering her body with his own, he kissed and nuzzled at her flushed breasts and soft neck as she recovered. 

"Let her out, Lillian," he whispered when her brown eyes finally regained focus. Smoothing back her long, flowing hair, he took her face in his hands and pressed their noses together. "For the rest of the night, I want you to release her. Let go, and let me take care of you." 

"Chris, I..." 

"It's okay, my love," he soothed, thumb brushing across her flushed cheek. "It's part of who you are, and I love every bit. Let her out, please." 

He watched as she hesitantly accepted his request, her beautiful eyes darkening. There seemed to be an internal struggle going on because she twitched beneath him, tensing momentarily before a shudder ran through her lush frame and the beast was back. 

"Hello, beautiful," he smiled down at the vampiress, expressive eyes replaced with bottomless black once again. 

"Thank you, young one," she nudged up into his face like an affectionate feline, her wicked black claws tracing carefully across his back. "It's nice to come out and play." 

"Well," he chuckled, spreading her legs and raising his hips to slot the huge tip of his manhood back into the frilly wet of her coral-flushed inner labia. He didn't sink deeper despite the inviting wiggle of her hips, just thrust minutely back and forth between her puffy, stretched lips. "We can play. But when we're done, you're going to stay with me, and we're going back out there to watch a movie with the girls. And you're going to play nice." 

One of her eyebrows cocked upward as he spoke, a challenging smirk growing on her lips. 

"Is that so, little dragon? Well, I don't... Fuuuuuuck!" 

He thrust into her savagely, spearing her to the bed and mashing downward to grind his spongy helmet against her cervix. 

"You will do this for me!" he growled, circling his hips, stirring his throbbing cock inside her. "You will respect my mates." 

"Yes," she croaked, her sneer melting into a lidded expression, exultant and loving. 

Squirming beneath him, she raised her long legs until her knees almost touched her shoulders. He couldn't help flexing his pulsing erection inside her as she aligned their hips. He was saddled to do some serious deep trenching, and it appeared that was exactly what she wanted. 

With only token resistance, he gathered her taloned hands above her head and held them there as he reared back and sank slowly but undeniably back to her core. 

"Unngg... dah! Feed me that big dick, that's just what I need. Hold me down and take me!" 

His member slid against every sensitive fold, stretching her delightfully. Those deep blue eyes of his, so intense and loving, seemed to fill her wicked, vampiric soul just as thoroughly as the pillar of male godhood dominating her greedy, juicy cunt. 

Her breath rushed out of her heaving, swaying chest as he began to rut. Leisurely, powerful thrusts at first, building quickly to use every ounce of his inhuman strength. His heavy scrotum slapped wetly against her upturned ass, the room filling with the heady fug of messy, unrestrained sex. 

Gone was the vampire's smirk of superiority. The ancient courtesan's cheeks were rosy, flushed as she moaned out her approval of his lusty efforts. He was beginning to breathe heavily under the pleasurable assault of ploughing his beefy cock in and out of her soft heat. He savoured sinking to the root, mashing her swollen little pleasure bean at the base of his cock. He loved when their smooth pubic mounds collided as he plumbed her depths. She seemed to like that too, squirming and hunching her hips to meet his every lunge. 

With, savage, pounding thrusts, he fucked Lillian hard and fast. It made her enormous breasts ripple and sway hypnotically, her nipples grazing his skin whenever he wasn't trying to capture them between his lips. Their bodies slapped together loudly, drowning out all but the vampire's loudest screams of approval. He was rough in ways he would never be with his other women, abusing her undead strength and resilience as he gripped her hips and thighs for purchase. His cock was in heaven, racing to orgasm as he ploughed through his mate's velvet furrow like a prize stallion. 

"Shiiit, I'm cuummming again!" Lillian squealed, legs kicking uncontrollably, and toes curling as her powerful body tried to throw him off. She was drowning in pleasure, but he was not to be denied his own release. 

"That's it," he coaxed hotly in her ear as she flooded around his cock. "Let it all out. I'm going to come soon. Tell me you want it, my dirty little piglet." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
"I fucking need it!" she cried, closing her eyes as she shook, helplessly lost in bliss. 

Grinning like a madman, Chris arched backward, sluicing out of her depths until her labia strained pink and taught against his sensitive coronal ridge. Pushing through the spasms of her climax, he sank back to kiss the barrier protecting her burgeoning womb. Even now, his seed was rising. His thick knob bucked, hardening further as his abdomen began to tense and shudder. 

He plunged to the hilt one final time as his precious seed erupted, blasting white against her tender, squeezing flesh. Lillian gurgled incoherently as he shot rope after thick rope against her deepest limit. 

Grunting deep satisfaction, Chris had to fight to keep his eyes open, hunching his hips with every blissful pulse racing up his bucking cock. He tenderly cradled Lillian's jaw, pricking his thumb on her fang to let his blood well up for her. Releasing her trapped hands, he lovingly ran his own through her sweaty hair as he unloaded his creamy jism and flooded her with magic. 

He watched her succumb, the vampiric embodiment of his mate, and reached deep for their connections. Blood, magic, life, and love. Forcing his magical awareness within her, he sought out every one of the teeming, microscopic creatures that made her what she was. 

"I love you, Lillian Kozlov," he spoke to every atom that made her, sealing the words with his magic as it sped through her veins. 

Her eyelids fluttered over black orbs, tears welling up as she twisted in a grimace of euphoria. It was as if his rushing magic carried the weight of his pure, overflowing love. She sucked greedily at his thumb as the warmth of his seed pooled and overflowed within her. It was unbelievable, waves of pure acceptance, of love, washed through her wickedness, her terrible crimes, and all her dark desires. It was too much, how could anyone feel this for her? 

Something pounded in her ears, vampiric instinct told her to crawl away, but her body didn't respond. His love inundated her completely, dragging her down into darkness as he hovered above her, those blue eyes sparkling in knowing satisfaction. The cocky little shit. 

Lillian came to blearily, weak and sweaty as he hauled her hips up into the air. He was still hard and enormous inside her of course, not bothering to leave her throbbing vagina to recover for even a few seconds as he rolled her into position on her front. 

"What did you do to me, young one?" she groaned, her body felt floppy and useless, like a wet noodle. It was all she could manage to turn her head and look back at him as he slid all the way home, dislodging a torrent of white seed to flow down her shaking thighs onto the already soiled sheets. 

"I did exactly what you needed, my beautiful mate," he settled his weight on her back and began kissing the damp skin of her neck. With satisfied grunts, he hunched softly into her, nudging her limit with the head of his enormous member. "You're mine, vampire. But I can't be only yours." 

"I know," she whimpered as he reached beneath to capture her massive swaying tits. Cradling and pawing them, he began to seriously fuck her abused little quim once more. With a knowing growl, he trapped her sensitive nipples between his fingers, squeezing until her head shot up and her hips bucked back into his groin. She could feel the soft skin of his bulging, hairless sack mashing against her overstimulated clit. 

"Despite my mates, don't I still love you?" he whispered in her ear as he plundered her with short, violent jabs. "Don't I give you more than a vampire could ever dream?" 

"Yes!" her inner beast cried joyously as he released a swinging breast to tenderly gather her hair with one hand. 

"Didn't I free you? Put life inside your womb?" he asked more harshly, tugging her up into an intense arch as he sank his fangs into her shoulder, pumping more of his maddening itch into her racing blood. 

"Yes," she gasped as his cock sawed hard against her incredibly sensitive g-spot, plunging her into a small orgasm. "You're... oh, dah... you're a fucking god!" 

"I'm no god," he chuckled breathlessly, delivering a satisfying swat to her vast, quivering rump as he began pounding into her again with most of his incredible length. "But you'd better start showing my First the respect she deserves. She loves you, you know." 

"I'm sorry," the vampire shuddered, helpless as a kitten as he took her roughly. Her scalp tingled delightfully, giving her just the right amount of pain as she lolled in his grip. "I'll be good, I promise." 

"I know you will," he brushed his lips against her ear. "Because if you don't, there will be no more magic for you. No more of my seed. I'll feed you blood. I'll still fuck you, but every time I want to climax, I'll make sure Immi is right there, and she'll get every drop that should be yours." 

"No!" 

"Oh, yes," he smacked her huge ass again, eliciting a high pitched squeal. "So learn to respect and love your broodmates. You'll be rewarded if you please me." 

With that final promise, the dragon shoved her forward, burying her face in the rumpled bedding. He proceeded to demonstrate his mastery of her pleasure. 

There was something primally satisfying in the sight of her reddened labia wrapped tightly around the thickness of his glistening, cum-streaked shaft. They really were a perfect match. Her breathy cries were music to his ears, and the small, tender rosebud on full display as he squeezed her jostling buttcheeks gave him a wicked idea. 

With a dastardly leer that might've given even her pause if she'd seen it, he flattened her into the bed with his weight. His cock snugly ensconced, he bounced his hips punishingly into the springy cushion of her spectacular, jiggling ass. One hand worked back into her tousled chestnut hair, tugging her head to the side so he could have her sweet mouth as well. His other hand wormed beneath her soft tummy to their tepid junction, skillfully caressing her throbbing love-bean. 

Taking great pleasure of his own, he despoiled the shaken vampiress through two more mind-shattering climaxes. He ransacked her to exhaustion, until she could barely speak or move. All the while, he forced the knowledge of his love into her very being until it was all her vampire mind could hold. 

Finally, he took mercy, unleashing his precious load into her, accompanied by a throaty growl of satisfaction. 

Assuming it was all over as his scalding seed jetted thick and creamy in her aching core, Lillian's body and mind began to unknot from their pleasured tangle. She'd never been fucked quite like that, both human and vampire were reeling. 

A gentle zenith of magical bliss still flowed through her as he emptied himself, one long strand after another, but she was done. She whimpered in relief as his hand slipped away from her inflamed clitoris. Throat sore and hoarse from screaming, she knew her ass would be covered in his big red handprints. It was intoxicating and a little frightening to be so used, and yet so loved at the same time. 

She moaned out a weak, wordless protest as he withdrew his huge slab of meat well before he was finished. Trails of warmth blossomed over her smarting ass and up her back. She squirmed coyly, cooing over her shoulder with fearsome black eyes as his semen rained hot on her sweat-slicked skin. The little blue gnat would no doubt smell it on her and be furious at such a debaucherous waste of his essence. 

"Unnnggghhfff!" her head shot up as he pressed the enormous, pulsing head of his cock to the winking knot of her unprepared butthole. 

"Shhh, it's okay," he soothed as his seed drenched her tight sphincter. He had a firm grip on her waist and used it to gently nose that hot, blunt tip into her rosebud. In response, her indignant little hole nipped and spasmed in complaint at the unexpected invader. "I'm not going in, relax. You're going to have to earn that." 

"Fuck, Chris," she breathed as he pulled her onto him just a little more. It was barely enough to open her, but suddenly the heat of his pulsing semen blossomed deep and satisfying in her bowels, just how she loved it. 

It was too much. She wouldn't have thought it possible, but pleasure overwhelmed her once more. 

"Hmmm," he chuckled darkly against her neck as he emptied his last into her. "There might be something to this after all." 

In contrast to the way he'd fucked her, Lillian was pampered gently in the aftermath of their rutting. True to his word, he told her to keep her dazed inner beast at the forefront of her being as he gently carried her into the shower. It was wonderful to just lean back against his powerful body as he washed her from head to toe, his seed leaking reluctantly from her body. She was sore and inflamed, he had used her and loved her, it was fantastic. She felt like a princess when he was finally done, but it didn't end there. 

Stealing one of Annabel's hairbrushes, he wrapped them both in fluffy bathrobes and pulled her out into the living room. The others women were halfway through some comedy movie, and she felt unusually self-conscious as they joined them. Apparently he felt none of her trepidation, guiding her into his lap on one end of a sofa to begin carefully brushing snarls out of her dark hair. She still felt weak, her pussy thrumming heady satisfaction and her limbs heavy and tired from their sex. 

"Relax," he whispered, running a hand up and down her flank until she snuggled against his side, allowing herself to enjoy his doting ministrations. The brush continued to work delightfully against her scalp and through her cooling, damp hair. 

"Damn, I want some of whatever she's had," Claire murmured in good-natured jealousy. 

"Amen," Susan nodded. "That looks simply divine." 

Lillian didn't respond or tease, she just smiled and let it all slip past her, washed away by the waves of loving satisfaction rolling off her mate. After a few minutes for everyone to settle back down and get back to watching the movie, Chris beckoned Annabel to join them. 

"Are you okay, Lillian?" she asked quietly as he made room and she snuggled against his other side. 

"I'm sorry," Lillian whispered as Annabel gently took her hand and began to massage, careful of the black talons still protruding from each digit. 

Their faces were barely a few inches apart as they rested on his broad chest. They could both hear the steady thumping of his heart beneath their ears. 

"It's okay," Annabel smiled, wondering what he'd done to the vampire to create such a reversal of attitude. "I know it can't be easy adjusting to the pregnancy... to being with him." 

"It isn't," the vampire confessed, surprising herself with the candid admission. "I'm growing so quickly now, and something's changing in me. I can feel it. I'm sated one moment and ravenous the next, I don't know if it's the pregnancy or whatever his magic is doing to me." 

Chris kissed her still-moist tresses in reassurance and hugged her tight against his flank. 

"We'll work it out," Annabel promised with boundless conviction. "We're all here for you, you know? Every one of us will do whatever we can to support you. That's how the magic works, how we grow strong together. I don't care if you're a vampire or you think you're evil or whatever. We love each other, and our dragon." 

"Thank you," Lillian husked, turning her face into his chest to hide her tears. She didn't deserve any of this, least of all this young woman's care and affection. She'd done such terrible things in her long life. How could this odd brand of domestic bliss be her redemption? 

She felt Annabel shift, sprawling across Chris to embrace her. The tears really began to flow then, and she voiced a muted sob as she somehow started to feel the waves of love and acceptance coming not only from him, but from Annabel too. They seeped into her, filling the dark void she'd so carefully cultivated for hundreds of years until it shattered under the weight of irrepressible truth. She was truly loved once more. 

*** 

The scenery of arid desolation scrolling past his window slowed, awaking Radek from his idle musings as the bus braked for yet one or another stop. At least it was air conditioned, the seats comfortable, and the cabin free of filthy, stinking livestock. Other than the seven other passengers, of course. 

Parched brown and scattered here and there with the bastions of termites, his view of the prairie outside reminded him of his time in another desert. He watched the shimmering heat rising from the baked, dusty soil, battering the already desiccated grass and scattered trees that waited patiently for the return of a kinder season. 

The corner of his lip twitched into a sneer, the memory came back to him too easily. 

Sand. Sand everywhere. So fine, so tiny that it was in every agonising breath of that acrid, pathetically thin excuse for air. His first battle. Back then he'd been such a puny thing, coughing up heaving breaths full of sand dust as he dodged this way and that, seeking only to live in the maelstrom of the front lines. Never mind the lust to kill, to devour, just survive this one day and live a little longer. 

The chaos of open battle among the ranks of his larger brothers and sisters had not suited him. Still, he'd survived. He and only two other neophytes had feasted that night under the tearful gaze of the world's broken fortress-moons, their domed cities burning as the favoured legion raped and devoured their way through the hapless population. 

That had been a long time ago now. 

A flicker of apprehension caressed the edge of his awareness, his uncanny senses jolting him to alertness rather like a hungry spider to the first tremor of its silk. The bus rocked slightly, coming to a halt in the road. He sighed, settling back into his seat as a heat-tormented soldier walked underneath his window at the back of the bus. Another checkpoint then, no matter. It was easy enough to make these pitiful creatures see only what he needed them to. 

Sliding open, the door admitted two sweaty men in uniform, armed and stern. The driver smiled obsequiously, bobbing his head almost as fluidly as the absurd figurine half melted to the dashboard. Radek reached for his power, preparing to enthrall the two men as they slowly walked down the aisle, displaying a penchant for diligence unseen at the previous roadblocks. 

He started suddenly as his magic slipped past the first guard, finding no purchase in the dark-haired man's mind whatsoever. A flicker of power brushed against his awareness, and he jumped from his seat, cursing himself for a complacent fool. He'd been found. 

"Pare!" the lead soldier shouted, dropping the documents he'd been inspecting to scramble for his holstered pistol. 

Anger rose in him, mostly directed at his own stupidity, but finding a convenient outlet in the form of the snarling soldier. Arcing scarlet from one extended fingertip, his power took the man square in the chest, crumpling, liquifying his innards. The man only managed a sickly gurgle as he melted to the floor, the finger of power crashed through him and into his startled companion even as he chambered the first bullet of his assault rifle's magazine. Too slow. 

The screaming started, as it always did. It was a beautiful chorus to his ears, promising power and rich satiation. His mouth watered in automatic anticipation but there was no time to linger, he needed to escape. Those men had been protected from his mind's touch, there were Beings here. 

The briefcase was already in his hand, but he knew he needed access to his precious stores if he was to escape this ambush unscathed, despite that, he loathed wasting such power. He bent to unlock it, unintentionally saving his life in the process as something punched through the bus' window. The safety glass transformed into a mosaic of cracks as the missile passed directly through the space his head had occupied moments before. 

He caught only a glimpse of the massive bolt, steel tipped and perfectly fletched as it whistled overhead before crashing straight through the opposite window in an explosion of glittering shards. 

Understandably rattled, Radek peeked around an unshattered window, searching for his attacker as he hastily threw open the briefcase. He grabbed at a careless fistful of leathery cards, crumpling them to grey dust. His eyes flicked to movement even as the heady power of six human lives rushed into him. 

On a small rise across an almost barren pasture inhabited only by two bony steers, a dark figure stepped gracefully from behind a stooped tree. Shouldering what appeared to be a comically huge arbalest, his ambusher stood with her hand on a cocked hip, regarding him in return. Even from a distance of over two hundred yards, the tall, feminine figure clad in midnight black from head to toe was known to him by reputation if nothing else. She began loping unhurriedly down toward the road, a display of nonchalance that galled his ego. 

"So," he growled in frustration as his ears drew his attention back to the shouts of converging soldiers. "They send the Huntress. Where then, is the Hound?" 

This was far more dire a situation than could have reasonably been anticipated. For a moment, his survival instinct urged him to flee right now, to vanish into the Ether and start again on another continent. Perhaps Africa? But time was getting short now, and he couldn't so easily recoup the cost of such a journey, let alone the risk of his passage being accurately traced. No doubt it would if they'd already gotten this close to him. 

No. No, that wouldn't do. What he needed now was to evade, to regroup, and to sow discord. Just buy a little more time. It appeared his relatively peaceful sojourn of the last few months was over. Time to throw a few more spanners into the works then, he still had several doozies left. 

First, though, he needed to survive. The power coursing through this husk of a human form gave him confidence, but he regretted the need to keep the farce intact a little longer. How he would enjoy the freedom of his true form in a moment like this, his full power unleashed against such a worthy foe. It would be too wasteful of his precious skin. 

It was almost flattering that the Huntress had been sent for him, though it made perfect sense. So, he rose to meet the challenge. Unmindful of the fate of his fine leather shoes, Radek calmy stepped through the muck of the two ruined bodies in the aisle. He left the other passengers to their screaming. This could work to his advantage if he survived. The Huntress had involved far too many witnesses, she'd given him an audience. Let them try to cover this up once he was done. If they could. 

Bullets started flying as soon as his foot hit the tar-bubbled pavement. He hardened himself, reaching uncaringly into his breast pocket as the angry projectiles bounced and ricocheted harmlessly, not even marring his suit. He pulled an ornately inscribed little vial into view, its liquid contents brown and thick. A vicious shake riled the half-crazed beast inside, an indistinct shape thrashing furiously in the dirty water. His little Australian insurance policy. He chuckled, there was nothing little about it. 

Wary of his ambushers, he glanced up and down the road, taking note of the soldiers as they tried to find cover behind cars who's panicked drivers wanted nothing but to get away from the sudden madness. His eyes fell on an olive-skinned teen, gawking from the back seat of the car in front of his bus, her phone held up to record. Such incredible technology they'd developed. 

The girl looked on in horror as a decorated soldier dropped his empty rifle to the road and charged forward with a cry of impotent disbelief. The unremarkable greying man just smiled at her, refusing to acknowledge the man who now pressed a pistol point blank to his temple. The soldier shouted some cliched obscenity and pulled the trigger. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
Radek simply smiled wider, watching her mouth open in a muted scream as the man's pistol exploded, scattering three fingers and a goodly chunk of thumb to the soft, hot breeze. Finally, he returned his attention to the soldier. It must be said, the man showed admirable bravery as he recovered from the loss of his hand and unsheathed a long blade from his hip. 

An approaching howl warned him to make his disposal of the human quick, but he couldn't refuse the opportunity to create such... damning footage. 

He took hold of the man's good arm almost gently, watching the hatred in his darting eyes drain to fear as a small surge of localised corruption let him merely pull the limb easily from its socket. Radek swung, again and again, bludgeoning the blubbering man down onto the pavement with the meaty end of his own appendage. 

When he was done he must have looked frightful, blood splattered over his face and charcoal suit as he stood over the unconscious soldier. He made sure to look back at the girl's camera and wink. 

Panic ensued. People ran screaming from their vehicles into the rocky brush at the side of the road, unmindful of the path of bullets as the few soldiers who kept their wits resumed their useless barrage with fresh magazines. An enterprising driver broke rank, gunning it up the wrong side of the road in a battered old truck, intent on ramming his way through the suited man. Radek sent it flipping end over end into the ditch from thirty yards away with a contemptuous backhand motion. The power required for such a dramatic feat was perhaps a waste, but he couldn't deny the satisfaction it bought him. 

The Huntress' appearance from a dry hedgerow didn't startle him. Indeed, he was waiting for her. She cut an appealing figure in her black leather armour, aiming that monstrous contraption almost lazily at his head. He dodged to the side as a dull twang announced the release of another thick bolt. It buzzed past angrily, the squat projectile penetrating the front of the bus with ease. 

"You'll have to be quicker than that," he sneered. 

Too late, Radek realised his mistake. A flicker of a smile on red lips inside her dark cowl warned him, but he'd already stepped firmly into the jaws of her trap. Another shaft streaked down from the sky, shattering his clavicle, two ribs, and skewering his lung like a kebab. He grunted in pain and surprise, blood gurgling up into his mouth as his ruined lung collapsed. Already, a searing coldness was spreading from the shaft, sucking up his magic. It must be enchanted. When had the uncanny bitch shot that one? 

"Quick enough, demon?" she lilted, her smile drawing taut a jagged pink scar across her otherwise perfect jaw. Already her arbalest was cocking itself, the thick bar of the metal lathe pulled to unbelievable tension by magical leverage. 

The bus rocked behind Radek, groaning in protest as something large vaulted onto the roof, eliciting a few more startled cries from its cowering occupants. He staggered forward, his grip of the magic seeping away. 

The two hunters watched warily for a moment. Cornered prey could be deadly, despite a fearsome wound. 

Impatience won, and the huge, grey-muzzled wolf pounced, quarter of a ton of muscle and bone and flashing teeth lunging for the kill. His smokey fur was still sleek and luxurious despite his age. Riddled with jagged lines and patches of white scar-fur, it proclaimed him the survivor of many a savage fight. Great dagger-like teeth snapped shut in a rush of warm, doggy breath, chomping loudly on thin air as the man barely managed to dodge away. 

Radek swung the briefcase like a club, ignoring the wailing agony in his chest. Backed by a large chunk of his diminishing power, the blow took the wolf before his hind legs even touched the ground. It sent the beast toppling into the dust with a muted yelp and a couple of broken ribs of his own. He lashed out blindly at the Huntress before she had a chance to retaliate, a corruscating sheet of unnatural red flame twisting toward her along the ground like a huge serpent. It was almost all he had left, that cursed arrow sucking greedily every time he used his powers. 

She was quick though, leaping into a high summersault, the fluidity of which announced her elfin heritage like a blazing neon sign. A retaliatory bolt nearly took off his ear, fired in the split second her feet touched the ground. With the unnatural flame giving chase across the dusty soil, she took off into a bounding run, maintaining distance even as she skillfully reloaded her mighty crossbow from a quiver strapped to her hip. 

He could hear the wolf scrabbling back onto its massive paws, a menacing growl promising vengeance for the blow he'd dealt. It was risky to turn his back on the Huntress, but he needed to put the hound out of action before he was overwhelmed and torn to pieces. Radek threw the vial at it with a final surge of power and will, sending the creature inside mad with bloodlust. 

"Kill them both," he wheezed, reaching to grip the icy end of the bolt protruding from his chest now that he had a hand free. "Death is your freedom now." 

The vial shattered in a billow of acrid brown smoke. The canny wolf leapt back with an alarmed chuff, his sensitive snout ruined by the cloying stench. Something grumbled inside the cloud, snuffling and rasping in disorientation. The respite didn't last long, though. Whatever it was let out a shrill trumpet of rage and charged out of the dissipating fog with the awkward, yet terrifying power of a bull elephant seal. 

The Huntress almost stumbled on a loose rock, not believing her eyes as the shaggy green monstrosity bore down on Balgruuf. Such a mistake would have been fatal with that cursed fire hot on her heels, but she recovered, notching yet another bolt as she looped back across the road to assist her mate. 

She'd never seen a bunyip before, but she recognised it from illustrations. The incredibly rare and usually placid aquatic sub-Being was a long, long way from home. 

Its face was a flattened, blocky thing. Dominated by two huge downward pointing tusks, it possessed a vast, salivating maw full of half-rotten, shark-like teeth. Long, rank hair sprouted all along its back in a mane, dangling green and matted over the shorter, darker brown coat covering the rest of its enormous bulk. A crocodilian tail sprouted from its narrowing rear end, furred rather than scaled. 

The thing was huge, easily larger than a hippopotamus and apparently just as bad-tempered. Its stumpy front legs were thick as the tires of the bus, bulging with muscle and tipped with wicked six-inch poisoned claws. Rather than running, it churned its entire body like a lizard, back legs almost dragging uselessly behind as it clawed forward, displaying an alarming burst of short-range speed. Its big, droopy ears flailed about comically, but its wide-set, baleful eyes were full to the brim with rage and madness. 

The demon had tortured this poor creature, broken it to use as his own. It was despicable, and she knew without a doubt that it would be a kindness to put it down. But how? They were ill-equipped to handle both adversaries at the same time, and the bunyip couldn't be ignored. Holding the nullifying ice magic lodged in the demon's chest was no small feat, his magic was vast, and every morsel her spell dissipated struggled to break the enchantment. 

Her first snapshot bolt didn't even penetrate its tough hide. By the looks of it, the wolf's teeth were nigh useless as well, serving only to enrage the thrashing monster further. At least Balgruuf's wolf form was proving too nimble for it so far, darting in to snap at exposed flesh only to retreat as the lumbering brute rounded on him. It might have worked, if he had a pack of fellow wolves to back him up. 

The sheer power behind the bunyip's every motion was astonishing. All it would take was a moment's distraction or a little bad luck, and her mate would be crushed and gored to death in seconds. 

She couldn't stop to concentrate for any magic-guided shot lest the malevolent trail of fire catch her or her tenuous grip on the arrow falter. What a mess. Why couldn't that first shot just have taken the demon through the neck like it was supposed to? 

Radek screamed, and the three-quarter-inch-wide bolt clattered to the road, glistening with frozen blood. He leaned against the side of the bus, light headed and gasping for air. The barbed head had torn savagely on the way out, but now at least his power flooded back into the open wound. 

The bus lurched up on two wheels against his back, threatening to topple sideways and crush him. The bunyip was trying to pin the baying wolf against the opposite side with yet another clumsy charge. The battle sounded ferocious, full of roars, growls, snapping teeth and the heavy, reverberating thumps of the bunyip's massive front paws. Yes, it was serving well as a distraction. Now he just had to make good his escape. 

A soldier ran blindly past him, terror written plain on his face as the simple image of the world he'd known his whole life was shattered in the space of a few violent minutes. Radek reached out for the back of his neck, slurping down the delicacy of a tortured soul with a visible shiver of delight. The man crumpled, twitching nerves crying out for guidance from his empty head. Down the road, a fleeing car veered into a fence post with a loud crash, the driver so shaken and relieved to escape that they lost control. 

"Little point in subtlety now," he nodded to himself, pushing into motion. One step, then the next, then another, the increasingly battered briefcase at his side. Running now, his power seemed to surge anew inside him, tempting him with the foolhardy notion to return and finish off his hunters. Instead, he fled the scene of his embarrassing ambush on inhumanly swift feet. Due west, he ran for the endless range of mountains rising skyward and ultimately, the coast on the other side. 

"It's time they paid," he grumbled, knowing full well that the rest of his journey would be fraught with danger, pursuit and worst of all, lacking the blessed comfort of air conditioning in the approaching summer's heat. Rage twisted crimson and bitter in his gut as he ran. Set free now that he had barely escaped such an unworthy end, it burst from him in a harsh scream, high pitched and alien in tone. "Filthy livestock! We'll see who's laughing when your blood turns the seas pink. Me, Me! M... khaaack!" 

Radek's lung spat up a foul, phlegmy ball of mucus and dark, congealed blood, cutting his diatribe short. Pausing to spit it out at the base of a termite mound, he wheezed up a little more. Glancing around suspiciously as he panted, the only witness to his humility were a pair of eared doves bobbing nervously in the upper branches of a nearby tree. 

Perhaps the olive-brown birds were too dumb to recognise the danger, or maybe they sought to stay with their nest. Mostly out of spite, Radek overwhelmed their tiny minds with a harsh wave of his corrupting energy. The hapless pair stiffened and fell through the branches to flop and twitch in the rank grass, shrilling their pain and dismay. 

He went to retrieve them, intent on eating them or at least making them suffer for being party to his failure. But as he stood over the wretched creatures, a particularly delicious idea tickled his mind out of nowhere. Stunned, he stood dumbly for several moments, wondering at the strange nature of inspiration. To kill two birds with one stone, so the saying went. Well, his stroke of genius involved two birds at least, and it had a certain poetic ring to it. 

Kneeling to collect one dove in each hand, he pushed his power deeper into their bodies, stilling their struggles. Almost tenderly, he stroked their fragile minds, infusing his will and whispering his instructions. With a crooked smile of anticipation, he watched their dark eyes flash crimson as they flapped free of his grip and raced northward with demonic speed. 

Mood much improved, Radek scuttled westward, intent on his vengeful plans.

"I didn't know that's how vampires get their power," Petra cocked her head at Immi over the breakfast table. "I thought it was to do with age." 

"That's what she's saying," Hailey spoke up to explain. "It's strongly correlated to age, but it's actually the replication of the magical parasite which is responsible for a vampire's strength. Usually, this is linked to their age, but Chris has upset the balance." 

"So basically, Chris' magic is making Lillian's vampiric essence go into overdrive, right?" Claire asked around a spoonful of crunchy homemade granola. With wet red hair wrapped artfully in a towel, her cheeks and neck were still flushed with the morning's passion. 

Chris thought she looked like the epitome of beauty, vitality, and young motherhood. 

"Yeah, and the parasite is multiplying fast on such a rich diet," Immi confirmed. "I had a good look at her while she was sleeping." 

"I'm just glad she'll be more open to the magic now," Annabel smiled softly. "You all know what I mean, right? This is something special we have, isn't it? I'm so happy to have ever met you all in the first place. Now we're family and I feel so fortunate because of it. I don't care if that's magic." 

A murmur of appreciation swept around his brood as he listened, halfway through devouring a toasted cheese sandwich at the kitchen bench. He wasn't stuffing himself with his usual gusto because he needed to save room for his morning's activities with Hailey. 

"I agree. Our relationship is something to cherish," Petra said. "A dragon's brood is like a magical choir, we all benefit when everyone is in harmony and singing their hearts out." 

"Does that make Chris the conductor?" Immi asked. "Waving his big stick around all over the place." 

He almost choked, inhaling breadcrumbs as they all turned his way. It was too bad he'd seen Lillian off early to the Compound to meet with Reyla, she'd have loved to see his distress. Apparently, there was some vampire business to be discussed in the wake of Lakshmi's failed challenge. 

"I believe that analogy is right on the money, Immi," Susan teased her young lover. "I thoroughly enjoyed my visit from the conductor this morning." 

"We heard," Annabel said wryly, making the dark-haired witch blush fetchingly in turn. 

"It's strange," Michelle nodded thoughtfully after taking a sip of coffee. "Chris and I haven't you know, done it that much, but I've noticed I'm happy just to see any of you at the end of the day. I'm not saying that I wasn't before, but it's different." 

"I think I know exactly what you mean," Annabel agreed. 

"That sounds nice," Hailey sighed. "I hope it's like that for me too." 

"I'm sure it will be, dear," Petra touched her arm affectionately as the others nodded agreement. "You're a lovely young woman, and it's obvious Chris is quite smitten with you. You're already part of the family as far as I'm concerned." 

"Thanks!" the werebison bubbled contentedly. "Chris, I'm almost finished. Are you ready to go?" 

"I'm ready." He scarfed the last few mouthfuls as she excused herself from the table and came into the kitchen to tidy her bowl and utensils into the dishwasher. "Where would you like to go today, angel?" 

"I sort of like that spot in the desert," she smiled at his endearment. "That burrowing owl family was so adorable!" 

Chris followed her with his eyes as she scampered over to the entranceway to retrieve her backpack before rushing to his side. Hailey was truly as cute as they came, and bustier than was reasonable for a girl of her svelte stature. 

"Owls, here we come." He took her hand as he prepared to phase. 

"Be safe please, honey," Susan entreated. 

"Where's the fun in that?" he teased. "But, I'll try. Okay, have a great day my lovelies, I'll see you all this evening." 

Their farewells echoed back to him as he slipped his magic over Hailey and pictured the dry creek bed near where the little owls had made their subterranean home. It was a perfectly remote spot for them to experiment. 

It didn't feel nice to lie. Well, it wasn't lying really, but his promise to Susan was about to be broken in spirit, if not practice. Something told him that he was ready, and he was about to put that feeling to the test with a serious leap of faith. A series of serious leaps really, and his magic quivered in eager anticipation. 

The disorienting, bodiless sensation of his jump was replaced with a cold breeze against his neck. The dry, earthy, and altogether wholesome scent of the desert filled his nostrils, and he inhaled deeply before he opened his eyes. 

Hailey shivered, pressing her busty form into his side. It was chilly this early in the morning, and the sun hadn't yet risen over the low canyon walls which made the spot perfect for hiding their more spectacular failures. The loose stones of the washed out water channel crunched satisfyingly under their hiking boots as they surveyed their cactus-dominated surroundings. 

Chris noted that whilst clear of obstacles and thus an excellent place to jump in, if there'd been heavy rain they might have found themselves dumped in the midst of a raging flash flood. Perhaps not the best then. 

"Aren't you cold?" Hailey looked up at him almost reproachfully. 

"It's not so bad," he shrugged. "I'm used to working outside in much colder weather than this. Besides, I'm a lot bigger than you, thermally efficient and all that." 

"No kidding," she put her backpack on the ground and extracted a padded down jacket. Her jeans would keep her warm enough for now, but she stamped her feet and rubbed her hands over her arms to stave off the chill. "You're not getting anywhere near my tits until it warms up!" 

"I can light a fire," he offered sincerely, wrapping an arm around her. 

"No, I know it'll warm up soon. Go check the coast is clear and I'll walk around a little to warm up. I can go see if the owls are feeling friendly." 

"Actually," he said, hesitant to voice his plan, but knowing her involvement was crucial. "I was thinking it's time we take this to the next level. We've established a good number of parameters about these orbs of mine. Watch this." 

He raised his arm, concentrating in the Ether as he summoned a tiny sphere of blackness and raked it back and forth through a nearby lump of brown sandstone. The rock crumbled with a series of protesting cracks and pops as it was magically diced. When the half-inch-wide orb was full, he began shoving in energy from his magical reserves. Soon, the molecules inside were starting to vibrate and disassociate in their excitement. He shot the orb high out over the expanse of cacti and woody shrub before releasing his iron grip on that section of the Ether. 

The resulting detonation could have been mistaken for a professional pyrotechnic display or perhaps a very unusual lightning strike. A sharp crack echoed across the valley as violent white tendrils laced fleetingly through the air, errant charged particles making their escape to a more stable state. At the centre of the disturbance, a shower of yellow sparks lingered for a second as the molten brew of rock shattered in the fresh air and fell earthward. 

"Partial ionisation," Hailey murmured, nodding thoughtfully. "Show off." 

"Yes, Ma'am," he smiled broadly. "That wasn't even trying that hard in either compression or temperature. I can already filter elements and control all sorts of tricky reactions. I think it's time we try for the real thing. At some stage, we have to switch focus to working out how to effectively contain and harvest the fusion reaction. That could be the hard part for all we know. Therefore we should try to see if it's even viable as soon as possible. Today, actually." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 9|
--------------------------------------------
"Today?! Well, I guess I can see the benefit," she agreed cautiously. "Have you considered the risks?" 

"I figure the main problems are safety and detection," Chris reasoned. "What if my orb can't sustain the extreme temperature and pressure? We could end up in all sorts of trouble." 

"You want to skip straight to hot fusion?" she scowled up at him. "What about my Muon net?" 

"Too complicated for now, I think. Besides, we don't have the materials ready. You said it yourself that the true grail of fusion would be to replicate the proton-proton chain, and my orbs might just be able to do it. If we pull that off, Muon-assisted cold fusion should be a piece of cake. Imagine it, Hailey." 

"Let me see your damn tongue, I swear it's silver." Her stern look was being ruined by her small bouncing motion as she rose onto the balls of her feet. "The first test will be very hazardous. If your orb breaches there will be all sorts of radiation and high-speed particles, maybe a huge electromagnetic pulse." 

"Let's not forget the worse case scenario." 

"A cascade," she shuddered and looked up at him searchingly. "I almost feel crazy for even suggesting the idea to you in the medical centre." 

"Crazy or not, my brilliant little bison, you've convinced me of the potential benefits. Look, there's your proof right there," Chris pointed up at the sun rising through the crisp, cloudless blue sky, radiating warmth and life-giving energy across the desert. "There's nothing magical going on there, even if I might have thought so before I met you." 

"That's very sweet," she hummed, reaching her arms up toward his neck in a gesture he'd come to understand meant she wanted to kiss. 

He was, of course, more than willing to comply, but such a maneuver required a more equitable vertical disparity. Sinking slowly to his knees in the rocky soil, he let his hands roam her trim hips as she leaned down and pressed her lips to his. 

Kissing Hailey was a delightful exercise, so soft, warm, and eager. Those beautiful cornflower blue eyes of hers twinkled as she slipped her pink little tongue boldly into his mouth. Her sweet scent washed over him, igniting a fierce desire as their lingual muscles danced. It was getting harder and harder to show restraint. 

"So, other than making me incredibly horny with sexy science, what's your plan?" she asked as she leaned away to regard him, hands running through the short hairs at the back of his neck. 

"If you thought that was sexy, you're in trouble, Mini-Moo," he chuckled, darting forward to peck her adorable nose. 

"Don't tease me, Chris," she admonished with a wee tug of his hair. "You're so confident about it all of a sudden. Out with it, what are you thinking? Are you sure you don't want to try my muon idea first?" 

"I've got confidence your idea for a muon trap could work, but it's about three layers of added complexity," he reasoned, taking far too much enjoyment from her endearing impatience. "It came to me last night, the perfect place to really finish our experiments. Somewhere far removed from population centres, no wildlife to worry about, just a couple of defunct old vehicles and..." 

"Just tell me!" She punched his muscular shoulder. 

"No one's been there for decades as far as I know," he continued, ignoring her attempted battery. 

"Chris, I'm about five seconds away from turning into a thousand pound buffalo and goring you." 

"Alright," he grinned. Standing, he brushed the dirt from his knees with excessive slothfulness as she scowled on. "Miss Sibon, how would like to be the first woman on the Moon?" 

Her eyes widened, flickering over his face for a sign he was sincere. Words failed her, her lips parting in a failed attempt to speak before she clamped her mouth shut. 

"I'm serious," he laughed, holding out a hand to her. "I think I can get us there inside an orb, no space suits required. I just need you to help me come up with the conditions that will make it safe for us. I figure if a squirrel can handle it we have to at least try to..." 

"Squeeee!" She launched herself into his arms, peppering his face with kisses. 

"That's more like it," he rumbled heartily and hugged her close. 

"You're the best fucking boyfriend in the galaxy!" she almost deafened him in her excitement. 

"Only the galaxy?" he joked, pulling away from her with mock hurt. 

"There are a lot of galaxies," she shrugged with failed nonchalance, still obviously giddy. "I can't jump to conclusions." 

"Huh," he snorted. "I suppose it is only the Moon." 

It took over three hours of careful planning before they were ready to embark on their historic attempt. Hailey scribbled list after list in her notebook as the sun rose overhead and warmed the Arizona wilderness. 

Chris watched, contributing when he could, but ultimately happy to sit back and let her remarkable mind attack the problem from every angle. Every now and then, he would catch her staring skyward at the faint, pocked visage of their destination hovering high above. Her obvious joy at the prospect, despite the inherent danger involved, brought a conspiratorial smile to his face every time. 

Perhaps it was foolish, but he felt flushed with righteous confidence. It took only a few minutes to confirm the instinct that if he willed it so, one of his orbs could safely accommodate him inside. Interestingly, he discovered that the width-less horizon of the Ether zones were impenetrable to him in both directions unless he specifically willed it otherwise. Once again, the orb conformed to both his subconscious expectations and understood his abstract thoughts. 

This reassured him against one of his key concerns for their upcoming voyage, that they might accidentally tumble out and be exposed to vacuum. He had plans of his own to test in that regard, but Hailey would be a goner in seconds. 

Making an orb sustainably habitable in space was complicated though. Of course, he left the tricky calculations to Hailey and her many lists. Ideal gas composition and partial pressure, temperature regulation, particle and radiation deflection, and even meteorite shielding; all and many more were accounted for, and triple checked. 

At her insistence, he attempted to manifest an Ether orb nested inside another. This proved impossible, and almost brought their escapade to a premature end. The problem was that without access to spacesuits, or at the very least compressed air tanks, they were going to run out of oxygen inside the orb too quickly. Especially if Chris went as a dragon, which was the agreed plan. His flight magic was pretty neat, and in space, it might just save their lives. Not if a second orb was required to carry reserve air for them. 

The prospect of failure drove him to try something he hadn't considered at all before. He could already summon more than one orb, he'd tried up to fifteen before. They were easily maintained once created, and it was changing their conditions and making them move that required effort and concentration. But what happened if two orbs were forced to touch? Could matter or energy transfer between the two if the parameters matched? 

The answer, they discovered, was yes. Therefore, Hailey's modified idea of a second orb, filled with condensed, liquid oxygen was back in play. That way they could realistically carry enough oxygen to survive for days if something happened to them in transit. Incredible as that prospect might seem, he'd needed a half hour lesson on the more advanced characteristics of gas interaction and the idea of alveolar pressure in order for Hailey to be confident that he wouldn't straight up kill them when he tried to refresh their oxygen. Their backup plan was that Chris could strip oxygen from the Moon rocks once they arrived. It would be a waste product in their collection of hydrogen anyway. 

They took an indulgent half hour break to take care of her needs once it warmed a little. Hailey's milk was as sweet, creamy, and delicious as ever. He was in genuine danger of becoming obsessed with the raised, puffy pink, cone-like nipples atop her incredible, bronzed breasts. She squirmed softly in his lap and held him to her bosom as he greedily drained her, running her fingers over his broad shoulders. Every now and then, her petite body shuddered as he stroked up and down her flanks or gently massaged her small, sexy ass through her jeans. She would coo contentedly as a surge of milk let down under his suction, their eyes meeting in restrained, mutually acknowledged lust. 

He wanted very much to give her pleasure, so he tentatively stroked her thighs and tender womanhood through her pants. Hailey really liked what he was doing to her, but begged him to stop in the end because she didn't want to spoil her underwear for the rest of the day with excess moisture. Chris thought it was silly to deny herself pleasure for such a mundane reason, but kissed her and made sure she knew there was no pressure to rush things before they reluctantly separated back to their tasks. 

Already the boldness of their plan had yielded significant dividends in the form of knowledge. There was nothing further to be gained by resting on his laurels. If they wanted to make a difference, the envelope must be pushed. He was incredibly grateful that his partner in crime shared that sentiment, as well as a mind capable of backing up his sometimes blind tenacity with a healthy dose of realism and cold logic. 

His only true qualms about embarking on this mission involved his mates. They were going to be livid when they found out, and fair enough, too. What he had planned was irresponsible given his domestic commitments. It didn't stop him, just made him feel guilty. This was a significant risk to be sure, but he hoped that if they managed to pull this off, the world might be a better place for all of them one day. At least that's what he told himself as he stripped off his clothes and prepared to transform. 

Hailey gasped at his dangling tackle, cheeks darkening as she muttered something about needing more practice. 

He let it slip and embraced the dragon dwelling in his core, body shimmering he felt it rise and swell, uncoil and then finally exploding into its full, majestic form. At forty-five feet from head to tail, the dimensions of his manhood were instantly forgotten as she was confronted with the startling reality of his nature. His great adder-like head snaked down to sniff at her, hot breath heavy with smokey spice. 

She stood dead still, marvelling at the reflected sunlight on his purple and cream coloured scales, the raw, coiled power evident in every serpentine movement. This would certainly take a little getting used to. 

Entranced, she reached out and tentatively patted his brilliantly scaled snout. He replied with a deep, happy chuff and a wet, fork-tongued lick. She laughed, and he pranced around her like a playful kitten, trampling hapless cacti and setting the inquisitive owls upstream to a concerned hooting. 

His sinuous spiked tail and clawed forewings looked vicious, but she knew it was his head that was positively deadly in battle. In the pit of her stomach, instinct sparked a smouldering fire in her young loins. Such a mate was sure to satisfy, protect, and provide for those he cherished. 

"You're beautiful," she whispered in awe, taking in the elegance and deadly power. "And really, really huge." 

"Not so bad yourssself," the huge serpent rumbled appreciatively in a timbre that defied even her father's deepest bellow. "The oxygen is beginning to condense to liquid. I only need to create our orb. Please read me the properties one by one, if you're ready?" 

Hailey gulped nervously, glancing down at the notebook in her quivering hands before taking one final look at the faint moon so high above them. It didn't seem real, that they were actually about to try this. This was her chance though, her chance to begin fulfilling dreams she'd lamented as impossible before she met him. She wasn't about to let a few butterflies in her stomach stop her now. 

"Yes. Visible wavelength photons, 60% permeable, 100% transmission," Hailey stated confidently, her chin rising as she met the dragon's appraising stare. He smiled, flashing a maw of brilliantly white, knife-like teeth. An enormous sphere shimmered into existence behind him, suspended in mid-air a foot above the rocky ground. Her first instruction had an astonishing effect. The surface of the orb seemed to shimmer with reflected light, yet within, she could still see a darker version of the desert landscape that lay beyond. 

"That is truly strange," the dragon observed, bobbing his head from side to side. "Like the spawn of a depressed snow globe and a disco ball." 

"Back to work," she laughed at his ridiculous yet apt observation. It was exactly the sort of thing Chris would say, and it was comforting to be reminded he was still there. "Gamma, impenetrable. X, impenetrable. Ultraviolet, impenetrable. Infrared and all larger wavelengths, transmit. Helium-4 nuclei, impenetrable." 

The list of required properties was long, but eventually, Hailey watched the dragon pad tentatively inside, coiling until every inch of his spiked tail was safely contained. He settled, turning to beckon her with a foreleg. 

"One small step," she sighed, hoisting her backpack. 

She experienced a moment of terror when she first touched the orb's surface. It seemed to take her hand in an unbreakable grip, absolutely refusing to budge as she tried to tug away. Her panic, and the resulting struggle sank her arm up to the elbow as she began to hyperventilate. 

It was the warm flick of a serpentine tongue on that hand which returned her reason. She looked up and saw the dragon had his head pressed hard into the other side, barely inches away. Even as a dragon, his concern for her was clear and once she calmed, her mistake was quickly apparent. The orb wasn't supposed to let her out. 

"Sorry, that was stupid of me," she apologised moments later when she stepped up and entirely inside. 

"There's no need," he said, rearranging his bulk to give her some room in the bottom of the rounded orb. He ended up offering her one of his front legs as a seat, and she caught her breath leaning back against the thick base of his neck. "I was thinking of releasing it, but it would have been such a waste." 

"I'm glad you didn't. Have you begun venting the nitrogen?" 

"Yes," he said, a note of humour in his deep voice. "Ready set, go!" 

"Oh shit!" An unrelenting force pressed down on her, squishing her back into the dragon. The last of her butterflies vanished, and indeed her whole stomach seemed to drop away under their acceleration. Something in her backpack pressed uncomfortably into her shoulder blade, and she squirmed to get away from it, a water bottle? "Aww, crap. We only brought a little water and no food." 

"It's fine. If we're not back by evening safe and sound, I'm probably as good as dead anyway. Look outside, Hailey." 

Gravity fought her savagely, making sitting up a struggle, but he helped her with a delicate nudge. When she focused her gaze out of their bubble, the dimmed view of the canyon was already fading away far below. She could even see the black sphere containing their air supply bobbing in their wake. 

"Fucking lift off," she gasped excitedly, switching her view heavenward. All she could see was blue sky, but as she sat cradled against him, it steadily grew darker and darker as they began to rise out of the atmosphere. Glancing to the sides, the planet's curve became more pronounced, and soon enough she could see both east and west coasts. "This is awesome." 

His coiled body was tense as he spent magic to fight the combined efforts of drag and gravity trying to keep them earthbound. In his mind's eye, the churning purple orb that held them safe slipped effortlessly through the Ether at his touch. The actuality was much different, and the sphere was waylaid by the unnatural properties he'd forced upon that small section of the universe. All the way up, gravity clawed at him, and the atmosphere had to be shunted aside with increasing force as they gained speed. 

The pressure eased as they soared higher above the planet through thinning air. He ruffled his wings, stretching in what limited way he could as these tensions eased and they rocketed out into the expanding void above them. Easing his magical push, he allowed the orb to continue with the momentum they'd already gathered, a bowling ball sent on its way down a freshly oiled lane. 

As his magic faded, they were suddenly weightless, still shooting upward and toward the eastern horizon. Hailey's excited squeal echoed around the orb as she slowly floated up past his head, flailing and laughing joyously. 

"Hold onto my neck," he offered humorously, twisting his head up to her as he braced himself against the sides of the orb with his wings and tail. "I don't want to accidentally crush you against the side." 

"I can't believe we're doing this, it's so beautiful." She clung to him, turning to look back at the swirls of white clouds on the canvas of green and blue below. It was a similar image that captured her imagination at a tender age, drawing her to pursue her scientific education rather than finding a niche in Being society. Now she saw it with her own eyes and the sense of wonder she felt was overwhelming. 

"Yes, it is," the dragon agreed, swivelling to regard Earth. "Worth fighting for, certainly." 

"Is that what we're doing?" she puzzled, looking up at the creamy underside of his rounded-arrowhead jaw. 

He sighed, cocking his head so one bright gold-laced eye could focus directly on his blonde companion. He shouldn't let his unease about Radek or the growing fragility of the Revelation taint this incredible moment for her. 

"No, I guess not," he purred. "It's just that lately it feels like all I've done is fight. So, thanks for giving me something productive to do." 

"You're welcome," she bubbled. Wrenching her gaze from the browns, tans, and rich greens of the African continent, she spun with careful handholds to find their destination. "Unfortunately we can't linger. It might look small from here, but it's easily as broad as the States, just really far away. So, onward chauffeur, to the Moon please." 

"And hopefully home in time for dinner," he scowled in concentration as he resumed propelling them and their sense of weight seemed to magically return. 

*** 

"Wait here," Michelle breathed heavily, glancing to Lisa as they came to a halt outside Reyla's study. The elf's urgent summons was ambiguous, but Michelle deemed it prudent that they run to get there. When a glowing blue glyph materialises out of thin air in your office and barks out a haughty command, what's to lose in arriving as quickly as possible? 

Lisa shot her a reproachful look, smoothing back short brown hair that was just starting to become sweat-damp at the roots. Running across cold downtown streets and through the Compound tunnels in her suit only to be told to wait at the door felt suspiciously like the sort of bullshit she'd endured in her first few months at the Bureau. 

"Sorry," Michelle nodded her acceptance of the silent rebuke as Samantha came huffing and puffing around the final corner and started up the corridor toward them. "I have no idea what this is about, but I can almost guarantee her mood won't be good." 

Without waiting for Sam to catch up, she rapped twice on the heavy wooden door and slipped into the dark room as unobtrusively as possible. 

Lisa only caught fragments of muttered words before the door closed again. Nothing she could make out for sure, but the mood inside seemed grim. Thankfully, there were three tall-backed, purposefully uncomfortable looking chairs in the corridor. Meant to disquiet the elf's guests as they waited for her audience no doubt. The new BIA agent didn't care in the slightest and slumped into one as her wind returned. 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Damn it," wheezed Sam as she crashed down beside her colleague, gulping down air. "I'm... out of... shape." 

"I wouldn't worry about it too much," Lisa glanced over at her reassuringly. Sure, Sam could stand to lose fifteen or so pounds to be in peak physical condition, but she'd mostly kept up on the way over. Besides, her figure was beautifully full, curved, and womanly. She looked great for a thirty-five-year-old mom. "You didn't have any problem throwing me around like a rag doll this morning." 

"Believe it or not, I'm out of shape with my judo, too," Sam sat back, closing her eyes as she wicked sweat away from her brow with her sleeve. "Michelle went in?" 

"Yeah, I'm dying to know what's going on in there," Lisa frowned in frustration at her exclusion. 

"Beings take a while to warm up," Sam noted to console her fellow angel. "I've noticed they don't care one bit for your human accolades or qualifications. You have to earn their trust through actions in their world. Michelle has earned their trust, we'll get there eventually." 

Inside Reyla's study, Michelle waited politely in the dense shadows at the rear of the room. The fireplace crackled happily, providing dim illumination and a sense of almost primal conspiracy in the darkness. It was obvious that an intense discussion was winding down and she wasn't about to interrupt. 

In human interactions, being ignored like that would probably be considered an insult. She'd seen that mistake over and over again when dealing with Beings, especially amongst powerful men who were used to obsequious courtesy in human society. It was stupid to assign importance to petty social niceties or to bluster with self-importance in the presence of ancient, magical creatures. So much could be learned by simply listening quietly around Beings. 

"Come now, Timothy," Lillian almost scoffed at the elemental in her trademark teasing accent. "I can't believe you didn't piece at least some of it together before now." 

"I've been focused on other things," Reyla's head of security shrugged. "It feels like I've been pulled in a thousand directions these last months. You're telling me you knew?" 

"Suspected," Lillian nodded. "Of course you don't go throwing those sort of suspicious around without proof. If I'd actually been in Brazil, I think it would have been obvious." 

"The signs are clear enough," Arvil agreed from his position leaning against the end of an ornate bookshelf. "Your work to keep the peace amongst the crafting syndicates was inspired though, Timothy, don't let Lillian tease you for missing it." 

"Harumph," grunted a very pale elf that Michelle had never seen before. 

He sat in a position directly across the crackling hearth from Reyla. This seemed to indicate some respect if both Lillian and Timothy, Reyla's defacto generals, were forced to stand. That in itself was very interesting, but how did he relate to the incident in Brazil? 

"You have something useful to add, Envoron?" Reyla's upper lip twitched, almost forming a sneer as the fair-skinned elf's inarticulate disapproval. She caught herself though. 

"No point in grubbing for proof that a wolf is a wolf while it drags off more of the flock every night," Envoron spoke with a thin voice, scratching out his words around damaged vocal chords. "You go out and hunt the cur." 

"How... enlightened," Reyla sighed in exacerbation. Acknowledging Michelle for the first time, she found her excuse to change subject as the wizened elf took breath to babble on. "Ahh, Michelle. Meet Envoron, our other resident class one Being. I'm sorry to say we're pulling him away from his peaceful retirement for today. Recently, events do seem to have developed an ugly tendency to precipitate." 

"Michelle Hamund. I'm honoured to meet you, Envoron." She strode into the flickering firelight, confidently introducing herself with an outstretched hand, only to be brought up short as the elf turned his milky gaze her way. 

"A human?" Envoron scowled, peering closer as if he didn't trust his magical senses. His voice was scratchy and unpleasant to the ears. "Ugh. What is it doing here?" 

"Yikes," Timothy muttered under his breath. 

Michelle glanced to Lillian for help, but she should have known better. The vampire was trying to contain laughter, her shoulders shaking silently. 

"She," Relya said a little pointedly. "Is here to help us find the best way to clean up your student's mess. Moreover, she's the dragon's Familiar." 

Michelle got a better look at the elf as he made a few throaty, indignant sounds and proceeded to sink back in his chair without reply. She hadn't seen that many, but for an elf, he looked ancient. Hell, he actually had a wrinkle or two and his eyes were obviously next to useless, clouded over and white. More shocking, his entire neck was a mangle of twisted, shrunken scar tissue. What, in this magical world of healing spells, magic blood, and restorative draughts, could have caused that sort of permanent damage? 

"What's going on?" Michelle asked hesitantly. 

"Yes. Well. There has been another incident with Radek, in Argentina no less. This time, as you humans like to say, we've really screwed the pooch." 

Michelle waited for someone to elaborate, and it looked as if Reyla was about to when Michelle's phone began the piercing chime that cut through her volume settings day or night. Only a few people ever called her from that number. 

Reyla's eyebrow arched as the offending phone was retrieved. 

"Sorry," Michelle looked around the room. "I sort of have to take this. Any chance it's related?" 

"I'd bet my firstborn," Arvil shook his head, apparently amused by the timing. 

"You're not likely to have one with skin like that, cousin," Reyla teased the half-breed elf as the phone continued to ring. 

Envoron snorted his agreement. 

"Take it, take it," Reyla waved as Michelle retreated to the back of the room. "Half the reason you're here is to help us see how they'll react." 

"Mr President," Michelle answered, frowning as the Head of State started straight in about a video that was sweeping through the internet like the pox. He seemed quite upset. Taken at close range on a high-end smartphone, it apparently showed the grizzly details of a magical street fight between first Radek and a few soldiers, then Radek and an Elf with an enormous crossbow, then a huge wolf, and finally some sort of summoned abominable creature. "Sir, I'm sorry, but can I call you back? I just walked into a meeting with Lady Narlakis and her people. I think they're just as concerned about this as you are." 

"They'd God damn better be," Robert Falconer growled down the line. "What am I supposed to do, Michelle?" 

"Play dumb for now, there's nothing superficial to link us to the incident. My initial advice is to tell the Argentinian government to say nothing. Get the tech-heads to give you an assessment on how viable it is to hush this up and take the video down. If it's too far gone for that, we'll just have to spin it some way or another." 

"Spin it? Spin it?!" the President groaned disbelievingly. "I'll send you the file, but even I can tell it's authentic. I just watched a man's hand get blown to pieces when he tried to shoot Radek point blank in the temple. It was the look on his face that did it for me, exact same look as this poor Iraqi back in the Gulf who managed to crawl out of his trench and surrender as we started burying his buddies alive in there with our tanks' mine ploughs." 

"I'm sorry you had to relive that, Sir," Michelle spoke quietly into the phone. She'd known the president was a veteran of Desert Storm, but she'd never heard him talk about it. 

"Don't be sorry for me," he sighed. "He tried to pull a knife on Radek, but the bastard somehow broke off the guy's arm and beat him to death with it while the girl filming screamed herself hoarse." 

"Jesus Christ," Michelle swore. "And it's spreading on the net?" 

"Like a bloody Mongol horde. Get back to your meeting, Michelle. See if you can come up with a solution for us all." 

"Thank you, Sir." The line went dead, and she met the eyes of each of the assembled Beings in turn, assuming by their pregnant stares that they'd picked up the conversation. "I repeat, what the fuck is going on?" 

"It appears that your friend Radek, is a demon," Reyla said matter of factly. 

"I'm sorry," Michelle cocked her head toward dark-skinned elf in disbelief. "One more time?" 

"A demon." 

By the time Michelle received the complete picture of the developing mess, a dull throb of pain was growing against the back of her eyes. She stood pinching the bridge of her nose, a habit she'd had some success with back when she'd worn glasses. Arvil, Lillian and Timothy had borrowed her tablet and were rewatching the footage for what seemed like the tenth time as she considered their options. 

"Why now?" she wondered helplessly. 

"Hmm? Why what?" Reyla spoke softly at her side, startling Michelle into a resentful scowl with her unexpected proximity. 

"For one, why the hell didn't you tell me Radek was a demon?" she hissed back, not bothering to hide her betrayal. She and Reyla had been working closely for months now. They'd managed to nurture a mutual respect and level of trust that bordered as close to friendship as the elf was likely to allow. "And two, why is the existence of demons only now coming to light? You know what this will do to the Revelation, don't you? People will say you've been negotiating in bad faith." 

"I didn't tell you because it would put you in an untenable position with your superiors," Reyla explained with uncharacteristic calm. The human had stood firm in the face of her own temper enough times that she had earned some respite in a time like this. "I have been trying to help prepare you and your agency as best I could at least. Besides, none of us really knew if he was or not until your team went down to Brazil. You can't just jump up and down crying demon without evidence, it's dangerous to stir up the weaker Beings like that. As for the other thing, we haven't really hidden their existence, we just didn't explicitly tell you about it. It wouldn't be a problem at all if Radek weren't causing so much mayhem. I don't think that's unreasonable given how humans are likely to perceive us anyway." 

"Okay." Michelle drew a calming breath as her mind raced through screeds of disastrous possibilities. They needed to come up with a plan of action as quickly as possible. "I can at least see your reasoning, not that I agree with it. What will Radek do now? How do we prepare?" 

"I don't know," Reyla admitted. "He managed to get here through the Barrier without being detected. That hasn't happened before, as far as I know. The Barrier nexi are an obvious target, but they're incredibly well protected. I think this is something new, should look to his past actions for clues." 

"He tried to make us fight each other openly." 

"The demon will retaliate," Envoron croaked his prediction, stumbling into the conversation. "They are petty, cruel, and cunning to be sure, but single-minded and entrenched to their orders. To be wounded so, revenge will burn hot in his soul. You say he has sown discord between human and Being? Expect more of the same." 

"Who is this guy again?" Michelle whispered, glancing quickly to Reyla at her side. 

"Envoron is a retired demon hunter of quite legendary repute," Reyla explained. "Long before my time, he slew the leader of a hellhound pack that managed to breach the Barrier. Demonic incursions were much more regular back then, and they've long since given up on that bull-headed strategy of throwing themselves to their own destruction. I think I was born sometime around then actually, not quite sure. He trained the elf you saw attacking Radek in the video." 

"Okay, but..." Michelle paused, not wanting to offend the grizzled elf. "Do we take anything he says to heart?" 

Reyla surprised Michelle by actually reaching to cup her ear and whisper her words directly against her skin, eliciting a shiver of gooseflesh at the contact of her warm lips. 

"Half the time I think he's senile but..." 

"I'm not deaf, girl!" Envoron barked, startling the conspiring pair. "Only blind." 

"But," Reyla turned her flashing grey eyes on the ancient elf and continued. "He is the foremost expert on demons we're likely to find, and we should listen to his advice. Where is the dragon, by the way? I assumed you'd bring him along." 

Michelle watched Envoron warily, but he seemed contented enough to drop the issue. 

"He's off with Hailey today, probably blowing something up with one of his orbs. They're up to something." 

"No doubt," Reyla's voice was thick with innuendo. "We will have to come up with a solution without his input then. The Synod has asked me to probe the waters and see if you think the governments will be open to a temporary lifting on the memory charm moratorium. Despite her failure to kill Radek, the Huntress was able to round up the surviving human witnesses and cordon off the area. The Synod is in possession of over fifty terrified humans, children amongst them." 

"Don't be so quick to dismiss Stemari's efforts," Envoron chided from his seat. "Whatever kind of demon that was, it is clearly powerful. She almost had him for a moment." 

Lillian decided to weigh in then, as Timothy and Arvil continued their blow by blow commentary of the bunyip's slow, messy defeat. The hunters had bled it to death in the end, inflicting as many small wounds as they could until it was weakened enough to land a sure, killing strike with one of the elf's long blades. 

"I'm sure Reyla doesn't doubt your student's skill or tenacity," she spoke as she slipped down into Reyla's comfortable seat across from the old elf. "Rather, she regrets the situation we are now faced with." 

"Of course," Reyla nodded with false calm. Beneath an icy exterior, her temper simmering at the vampire's boldness to goad her at a time like this. She reeked of him, and her magical aura was practically on fire with the sort of satisfaction that left no doubt what they'd done together last night. "What do you think, Michelle?" 

"No." 

"Just like that? This could all go away you know." 

"No, it can't go away," Michelle reached to massage the bridge of her nose again but stopped herself short as the beginning of a plan began to form. "The video is probably being viewed by thousands of people as we speak. Will you tamper with their minds too? No, your omission of the existence of demons will do enough damage to the Synod's relationship with the world's governments by itself. Don't even suggest the memory charm. What we need is a conventional cover-up, a boatload of bribe money, and to control the media angle on this. And you need to pull out every magical stop you have to help me. Is there a way to disguise someone's appearance, make them look exactly like another person?" 

"Of course," said Reyla. "They don't stand up to magical scrutiny, but I suspect that's not what you want them for." 

"Good, let's go then." Michelle snatched her tablet back from the bemused elemental and turned to walk out of the room. 

Lillian rose and nudged past Reyla as she followed, grinning wide at the elf's confusion. 

"Go? Go where?" Reyla spluttered indignantly. 

"Argentina, of course. Time is of the essence." Michelle spoke over her shoulder, phone already in hand and dialling. She was out the door and striding briskly away, Sam and Lisa falling into step behind Lillian without a word. 

"I don't simply go to other counties at the drop of a hat!" Reyla burst out of her study, her anger swelling as the four women ignored her, bent to the will of their leader. Only the caramel-skinned one, Samantha, looked back with an apologetic smile and beckoned her to come along. 

"Sir, you're not going to believe this, but I'll explain everything as we get underway." 

"What do you need, Michelle?" The relief in the President's tone was palpable. Robert Falconer had been impressed with the calm competence of this woman ever since her file had crossed his desk. She'd only proven herself further since then, and she was tenacious once she sank her teeth into something. He'd have considered attempting to court her if he wasn't already happily married and in about the most public office there was. 

"First, we push the video to the media." Michelle was almost at the main reception of the Compound now, and the occupants of the huge underground room stilled as their entourage burst from the corridor. "Get a video expert to put some very minimal traces of alteration in there, stuff that makes it look like it's been worked on. I'm talking tiny, undetectable without video forensics, we want Peter Jackson getting instant wood when he sees this." 

Reyla had thankfully composed herself by then and apparently decided to join them without further outburst. Timothy was attentively receiving instructions for running the place in her absence. 

"Okay, what then?" Robert was intrigued now. 

"Give it to the media but don't tell them shit, let them run it however they want with as much confusion and panic-mongering as they like." 

"Surely not." The President leaned back in the Oval Office, rocking the reclining function of his plush leather chair back and forth in apprehension. "I hope that's not the end of your plan. What do we say when we're asked to comment? What is the Argentinian government going to do? How am I supposed to get them to toe the line? Hell, what is the line?" 

"You tell them to keep their damn mouths shut until I get down there," Michelle snapped, pausing as Lisa mouthed to her that Kat and Pamela were going to meet them at the airport. "Sorry Sir, I'm a little wound up, and this has to go off without a hitch." 

"You're fine, Agent Hamund," he chuckled nervously. "Get us out of this mess before the U.N. summit and you can be as pert as you please. I've already put off a call from the German counsellor because I hadn't come up with a strategy." 

"I'll certainly try, Sir. Argentina has been struggling for a while, perhaps you can dangle some sort of economic carrot to keep them to the lines we supply. If not, I'm sure you can think of a suitable stick. In the meantime, I need a camera crew we can trust. Also, the prettiest, dumbest South American news correspondent your people can find on short notice." They were inside the Compound garage now, and Lillian blurred on ahead to prepare one of the large SUVs that would carry them to the airport. She glanced at Sam's hurried tapping on her tablet and was pleased to see she was in communication with one of their pilots already. "We'll need a healthy slush fund for bribes too. I want some people to disappear for a while, so my teams will start gathering information on everyone associated with the incident. If you could work out a contact for us in the S.I.D.E. and smooth the way for us to go down there hot, it would be a great help." 

"Where are you going with this, Michelle? This is starting to sound very... bold," the President spoke in her ear. 

"It'll work. I've got magic on my side, remember?" 

"Okay, I trust you to give it your best shot," he agreed cautiously. "Tell me the broad strokes at least." 

"We have to control the narrative, Sir. While I'm down there coming up with a cover, we'll very quietly replace as many original copies of the video as we can find with our own slightly edited version. Not everyone will be convinced, but if we give the public a plausible explanation, enough of them will go along with it to tip the scales in our favour. At least I hope it works that way. Reyla said that the Synod has offered to use the memory charm on the survivors but I told her that's about the worst thing they could do..."

--------------------------------------------
Michelle paused, Lisa was patiently holding the back door of the vehicle open for her, but she needed a moment to prepare for what came next. Where the fuck was Chris? He could back her up with that wolf-puppy charisma at a time like this. 

"Because, Sir?" 

"Yes?" 

"Radek is a demon." 

*** 

"I don't want you to jump like that anymore." Hailey's worry was clear in her tone, half a note higher now after his latest teleportation. "We have to start slowing down soon!" 

"Well, I could just tell the orb to stop moving and..." 

"NO!" she cried, beating her fists against the tiny scales of his forewing. Without gravity to ground her, the effort almost sent her tumbling off around the orb. Only a snatched grip on the wing she'd been pummeling saved her the indignity. "Do you want us to go splat? Don't you remember what I told you about momentum?" 

He chuckled, of course he remembered. The Moon loomed in front of them now, beginning to reveal detail even a powerful telescope would miss from Earth. 

"Asshole," she muttered, floating down to the relative safety of his coiled body by gripping the tiny gaps and edges between his larger scales. "I should have known better than to fly off into space on a crazy adventure with a half-cocked dragon." 

"Half-cocked?" he rumbled mischievously, taking his eyes off the grey and black surface ahead. He couldn't help himself when presented with an opportunity like that. But in consolation, he leant his head down to nuzzle against her. 

"You're the fucking worst. Worse than Dad by far," she guffawed, pushing at his snout as he wormed his great big head against her tummy. 

"And you're a little worry wart," he replied. "I'd never have thought you of all people would be so antsy. Look up at the stars, Hailey. Isn't this amazing?" 

"Of course it is," she exhaled, looking back over his purple haunches at the Earth because the stars were becoming harder to see in the reflected light from the Moon. 

Their home planet seemed not much more than a colourful basketball held at arm's length now. Dimmed through the filtering effect he'd put on their absurd spacecraft, she could still make out green and brown continents amongst the swirls of blue and white, but not much more. It was sobering to think that all it took to make everything she'd known in her life seem entirely insignificant was a little distance. Perhaps that's what had her so wound up. 

"What's wrong?" he asked, his voice so deep she felt it through her entire body. 

"I don't know, Chris. We're so much smaller than I'd ever imagined. I mean, I knew that already but that didn't prepare me at all for the reality. And orbital mechanics are no joke by the way! NASA spends years and years working stuff out and quintuple checking every calculation, but you're literally flying by the seat of your pants!" 

She had a point. Discouraged by the refusal of the Moon to grow any larger in his view, he'd tried to phase jump them closer. After all, he could jump to places he could see or remember well, couldn't he? Well, he could see every one of the hundreds of thousands of miles between them and their destination. There shouldn't even be anything in the way to crash into, and the orb might protect them in that event regardless. 

It was rash, but it had indeed worked. Another leap of capability to tick off for the day. He didn't know what it was, but as soon as he reasoned out these crazy ideas, he was confident his magic was up to the task. That wasn't to say he didn't have limitations or respect Hailey's caution, it was like he'd woken up that morning and already known that today was the day he had his first crack at fusion. 

"We're not actually going that fast," he reassured her. "Remember when we accelerated after our little break in orbit? The g-force wasn't that uncomfortable, maybe 2g? And it was probably half an hour before I got fed up with that and did the first of five jumps. So, we're going roughly twenty meters by sixty seconds by thirty minutes... that's um... thirty-six thousand... meters per second. Damn, that's pretty quick." 

Their mood sobered instantly, and Hailey did some of her own mental arithmetic, to unsettling result. 

"You big idiot, sustained acceleration is very powerful. That's thirty-six kilometres per second. It wouldn't even take three hours to get from the surface of Earth to the Moon at that speed, and you jumped us most of the way there!" 

As one, they turned back toward the looming Moon. It seemed much bigger than it had barely minutes before. It no longer gave the impression of a flat, splotchy circle surrounded by inky blackness. Enticingly, she was showing them her curves, as well as every impact, valley, and mountain on her scared surface. Coming in that fast, they were about to make a mark of their own. 

"Shit! Shit, shit, shit," the dragon cursed. "Hold on, Hailey." 

He tightened the coil of his tail around her, bracing his wings, head, and hind legs against the sides of the orb. Feeling for it in the Ether, carefully pushed the order to resist their momentum. 

In the first fraction of a second, he knew he'd royally fucked up. It felt like Lillian had sucker punched him in the kidney, only across every inch of his body and multiplied by ten. Barely, he resisted collapsing into the forward surface of the orb. It would have crushed Hailey under his draconian bulk. His entire body fought that overwhelming weight squishing him from behind, and he could barely even lift a claw. 

Unfortunately, his head was pointed toward their deceleration. Blood pounded in his ears, reddening his vision dangerously as it drained from the rest of his tissues. His head felt like it might split in two and birth a Sci-Fi monstrosity, he'd heard about this effect somewhere, perhaps a video game. Although he didn't know if dragons could suffer hemorrhagic stroke, now wasn't the time to find out. 

"Tt...omuurrrrch," Hailey groaned with the last of the breath forced from her lungs. She'd been thrown against the thick curve of his tail and pinned, body bent helplessly into a C shape. Outstretched and impossible to move under their weight, her hands swelled red with pooling blood in her trapped, fading vision. She couldn't breathe, and her arms felt like they were about to snap off and float away. Her bulging eyes wanted to elope with them, straining to get out of her sockets. That would have almost been welcome given the amount of pain she was in. Something in the back of her mind screamed silently that she had only moments left to live. Then she felt nothing, and it was bliss. 

Chris fought to gather enough focus to reach for his sense of the orb. When he did, his mistake was evident and amateur. He'd thought himself smart, even conservative, to envision such a low coefficient for their deceleration. The plan had been to start gently and ramp up until they couldn't tolerate the g-force. After all, they had an urgent need to not become just another crater on the surface below. But he'd stupidly been thinking of a percentage, not a solid measurement. Even shaving zero point two five percent of their astronomical speed had almost killed them. With what little mental fortitude he could summon, he eased the push to a comparatively mild thirty meters per second. 

They both collapsed, slumping limply into the forward curve of the uncaring orb. 

"You okay?" he panted uncomfortably, still mightily heavy under his three times increased relative weight. Through one eye, he could again see the pocked surface rushing upward indomitably. But Hailey didn't reply. 

It was the funniest thing to his addled mind, his whole life he'd assumed the Moon was dull and flat, but that wasn't true at all. They were about to be swallowed into an enormous crater, the sides of which must have been almost five miles high. 

With the return of more normalised blood flow to his brain came his sense of urgency, and a rising panic. They were going to go splat in very short order if he didn't do something. He tried to right his massive body, straining against leaden limbs. It reminded him of being fascinated by the astounding weight of gold compared to other metals. He was made of gold now for sure, not even able to roll onto his belly. 

"St... Stay on your back," his salvation spoke with a laboured gasp from somewhere underneath his pinned left wing. "You have to...ungnnn my eyes! Chris, slow us down faster!" 

"Hailey!?" he roared, trying to move his sinuous neck to find her. 

"Do it now," she croaked under the strain of working her lungs. 

He did as he was told, and more weight crashed down on them. 

The powerful body his dragon had almost considered invincible got uncaringly squished by the unrelenting laws of physics. He couldn't move at all now, pinned a-splay like a dying frog under a director's microscope. This orientation of his body was far more bearable however, and they were shedding speed nicely. 

"Hicck... Hicck... Mooaar... Hicck." She struggled to even move her tongue, to tense her diaphragm and keep air in her lungs for more than a second. She tensed every muscle group she could in an attempt to maintain enough blood pressure to stay conscious. 

Chris knew it wasn't going to be enough. With eyes spaced on either side of his head, a dragon's field of view was near complete. Out of the tinted event horizon of the orb, the bright, grey surface charged at him. Innumerable tiny craters showed themselves now, along with individual rocks and the streaking trails created by flying debris in the dusty regolith. 

With his last seconds, he searched for a way out. 

The orb was the problem. It was their lifeline and their deathtrap. Without it, he could slip them into the Ether, but they would soon suffocate in the cold vacuum. With it, and the protective properties he'd set, they would come to a jarring end, pulverising their bodies to bloody mist. They were going much slower now, but it wasn't nearly enough. 

As the crater's edge seemed to come level with them, revealing a deeply shadowed slope kilometres tall, the solution seemed suddenly obvious. 

Hailey cried out in wordless alarm as he eased them off to a gentle, single Earth gravity deceleration. No longer pinned, his serpentine head rose to look back up into the encompassing darkness above. With a desperate growl, jumped them a little way back into space. He lay still, focusing on the sound of his heaving flanks pumping air into his lungs to keep out the vision of the bottom of that colossal basin dashing up at him. 

"I've changed my mind," he almost wept his relief. "I hate space." 

Nudges alerted him to her predicament, and he carefully rolled onto his side so she could crawl out from under his wing on shaky arms. Her unsteady movement alarmed him, she reached tentatively with her hands before placing them down on the slick inner surface of the orb. 

"Chris?" Her voice sounded frightened and tiny, turning her head this way and that searchingly. "What happened? I can't see." 

"Oh, my god! Hailey, stay still." 

She looked up, drawn by the sound of his voice. Her eyes were almost entirely red, her blood vessels put under too much strain. A sweep of his frantic magical scenes told him that the superficial bleeding in her sclera, while dramatic, was not the problem. Vesicles deeper in her eyes were ruptured, leaking blood into her vitreous, waylaying light as it travelled from the lens to the retina. 

"Did we make it?" she asked bravely, blinking around as if to help clear her vision. 

"Oh, Hailey," he rumbled soft and deep, taking her small body gently into his large forelimbs. "I was so stupid, I'm sorry. Please, let me fix this." 

"Tell me we aren't going to crash into the Moon first," she murmured, resting her forehead against the creamy scales of his chest. 

"We're not. I'm such a fool. I accidentally slowed us by a percentage of our speed. Only once we were moments away from hitting the surface, I realised that if I'd jumped us forward, I could do the same in reverse. We still inherited all our momentum, but I can keep hopping back as long as it takes to slow down safely. I'm so sorry, Hailey." 

"It's okay, Chris," she sniffled, her wrought nerves releasing as the adrenaline began to fade in her bloodstream. "I'm just glad we made it, I was so frightened... I think we both lost our heads when we realised how fast we were going. It's a fucking wake up call. We're kids with big heads in a magic bubble, not invincible. Next time we'll remember that." 

"Will there be a next time?" he wondered allowed. 

"Of course," she sat up almost indignantly and gave him a bloody, sightless stare. "Fix my eyes with your saliva and get us down there. I didn't go through all that for nothing." 

It might have been comical if his heart wasn't breaking for his brave little space cadet. 

*** 

Petra shifted restlessly in her seat for what must have been the tenth time in as many minutes. Yet another frisson of worry ran up her spine. 

She was supposed to be allocating next week's refilled gemstones and crystals between the thirty-seven purchase requests she'd received in the last two days. It was a good thing Chris came like a stallion and had the stamina to bed Claire, Susan, and herself almost daily. It allowed her a pleasant, leisurely transition back into motherhood, while still turning a healthy profit. 

"Try calling him, Mom," her daughter suggested without even looking up from the thick medical textbook in front of her on the oaken dining room table. 

"I don't want to be 'that' sort of partner," the mature blonde admitted. Petra put her tablet aside and rose to do some pacing. She wasn't getting any work done anyway, sometimes it helped. With a faithful black scrunchie she'd had for years now, she collected her long silvery tresses into a ponytail that fell far down her back. "Besides, last time I called, it said not in service." 

That got Claire's attention. 

"What do you mean?" she frowned, sitting back in her chair. "It's Maginet, that's impossible." 

"Try it yourself," Petra paced, her hand unconsciously caressing the little swell of her pregnant belly through her loose green blouse. Her precious son, whose father was experiencing some sort of distress, according to her uncanny intuition. 

Claire did just that, snatching up her ruby-encrusted phone to dial him. She waited with growing dread for the familiar ringing to begin. All she got was a long pause followed by two beeps she'd never heard before, and finally, an insincere female voice apologising that the device wasn't in service. 

The phone landed roughly on her textbook. At this very second, her mother was no doubt racing to the worst possible explanation. Best that she think logically about this. 

The problem was, she'd never heard of a Maginet phone being out of service. If Chris simply had it turned off while on his adventure with Hailey, it should go to voicemail at least. That lead her to try the young werebison's number for the same troubling result. 

Try as she might, she couldn't explain it and started when she found herself absently petting her own little bump. What they needed was a distraction she decided. Chris was probably just doing something crazy with his magic. Who knew what one of those damn orbs of his might do to a Maginet phone. 

"Okay, no point stressing all afternoon. I'm not going to be able to concentrate with you wearing down the carpet like that anyway. Let's go talk to the Japanese guy who admins the system for Reyla. Maybe he can tell us what it means, I'm starting to get curious actually. What's his name?" 

"Tosh, I think," Petra frowned, reluctant to get drawn into her daughter's distraction. 

"Come on, Mom don't be like that," Claire coaxed. "You know he can take care of himself." 

"I'm sure you're right, dear. It's just that after your father I don't know if I can..." 

"Shhh!" Claire bustled around the table to embrace her mother. "Don't do that to yourself. Chris would fucking shred any hunter who tried to take him. He's just done something silly. I'd bet my sweet left tit he'll be back in time for dinner with that stupidly adorable look on his face, and then we'll both feel like clucky fools." 

"Ahh, haha. I can just see it," the silver-haired dragoness breathed, pecking her daughter's refined cheekbone. "Thank you, Claire-bear." 

"No problem, Mom. Let's go see Tosh, I could use a walk actually, and this is probably one of the nicest days we'll have before Spring. You're ah... you're not starting to get nesty, are you?" 

"I certainly hope not, dear. Just your Mom being overemotional. Though, I guess it won't be too long now. Come on then, with this talk of nesting I'm starting to get a craving for some ice cream." 

The dragonesses made a stunning pair in their warm, flannel lined jeans. Petra's blouse was loose in a way that teased her figure, while Claire's grey, fine-spun sweater hugged every curve deliciously. They carried windbreakers under their arms as they traversed the hotel and made their way down into the Compound. 

It took some getting used to the minor celebrity that had sprung up around them in the local community. Their pregnancies, Chris' remarkable magic and heroic deeds, as well as the flood of magical crystals they pumped out to the Being craftsfolk all sort of simmered down to a reverent notoriety neither woman had experienced before. 

Beings nodded respectfully and smiled at them as they passed. The boldest socialites even stopped to fuss saccharine about their remarkable joint pregnancy. Between themselves, Claire and Petra joked that most people must wonder if Chris had just lined them up side by side and given them both the business in one marathon session. He was undoubtedly growing the reputation for it after planting his seed in the local hardass vampiress, too. In reality, they were a couple of days apart, but most people just saw the exact same size of their growing tummies and started to whisper and smile knowingly. As far as the norm of dragon fertility went, he may as well have bred simultaneously. It was unheard of, and that fueled the gossip. 

They had to inquire at main reception where to find the Maginet administrator, and that was when they first heard about the unusual departure of Reyla, along with Michelle, Lillian, and the Angels. 

"Where did they go?" Petra asked the slightly frazzled receptionist, who had just been dealing with an irate bunch of visiting Chinese syndicate members. They'd had their appointment with the Lady unceremoniously dropped until further notice. 

"I don't know," the middle-aged witch wrung her hands. "She hasn't left the territory in decades. Oh, what am I to do?" 

Claire was just happy that the oriental Beings across the lobby were too upset to recognise them, the source of the crystals they were so tenaciously negotiating for bulk purchase. 

Reyla had been kind enough to fly through that flak-storm on their behalf. Neither mother or daughter had any interest in supplying these middlemen, who no doubt planned to resell their magic at an extreme markup. So, the elf was generously slapping down exorbitant tariffs on their export and generally negotiating like a petulant child. 

The local artisans were just beginning to flourish under their patronage after all. Prosperity was already trickling back into what had been considered an almost dreary, backwater Hub for many decades. There was even a rumour floating around that a representative of one of the major Dwarven clans had been scouting property in the area last week. The territory hadn't had a proper smithy since the gold rush over a century and a half ago. 

Thankfully, Timothy Garril spotted them at that point and took them aside into an empty meeting room to explain the situation. He'd actually been meaning to get on his way to find them and pass on Samantha's last minute request. Her daughter needed to be picked up from school and cared for while they were down in Argentina. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 12|
--------------------------------------------
Both women were shocked and worried at the discovery of Radek's true origin, but promised to keep the information strictly to their brood. Petra quickly voiced her concern that Chris was out of contact and she had been having troublesome premonitions all afternoon. 

Claire was surprised when the elemental nodded gravely and urged them to seek Tosh at his home address immediately for a trace on Chris and Hailey's whereabouts. She'd been expecting a polite dismissal of her mother's worries as nothing more than a pregnant foible. But the powerful elemental was apparently in touch with some of the more... illogical capabilities of magical connections. He wasn't about to discount any lead, especially given the seriousness of what was going on in South America. His own orders involved protecting the three dragons at all costs in Reyla's absence. 

Mother and daughter ended up taking a human taxi across town to Tosh's address rather than sign out a vehicle from the pool. While the driver congratulated himself on landing such an attractive fare, Claire mused that Radek's activities had one silver lining. Their afternoon was turning into a veritable adventure. Once they took charge of Amy, Petra was going to be perfectly distracted for the rest of the day. 

By mutual agreement, they decided not to worry Annabel, Immi, or Susan just yet, in case Tosh had a simple explanation. 

"He's an arachnid, isn't he?" Claire confirmed as they double checked the address and swung open the ornate wooden gate protecting the pathway up to the house. 

"I believe so," Petra said quietly as they walked past a beautifully manicured rock garden on one side of the compact yard and a large glass greenhouse on the other. 

"Rare," Claire murmured as they approached the front door. "I remember his daughter from the night of the club shooting. What a butt." 

"Don't be rude," her mother hissed, followed by a warning pinch on Claire's own well-formed rear end. 

A brief outbreak of playful, silent retaliation ensued, stalling them on the landing. They took another moment to compose themselves afterwards. With a final sideways glance to her daughter, Petra pushed the doorbell button beside an intercom system. An unusual, multi-toned melody echoed inside for several seconds. 

Without even the warning of approaching footfalls, Masatoshi himself answered the door. He bowed, mildly confused at the arrival of such unexpected and indeed, prestigious guests at his residence. 

He was a handsome man, Claire thought. His short black hair seemed perfectly aligned, right down to the individual strand. Chris could stand to adopt some of that fastidiousness. The arachnid Being had a lean, wiry build and an economic, smooth way of moving. She wasn't quite sure how they aged, but he seemed young, perhaps in his mid-thirties. 

There was a brief moment of awkwardness where neither party knew who should speak first before Tosh remembered the hospitality his mother had drilled into him as a boy and invited them inside with a broad, genuine smile. 

"Petra, Claire, welcome. Please come in." 

The young dragoness thought the way he slightly fumbled the r-sound in her mother's name and the l-sound in her own was just too cute. 

"Thank you, Tosh," Petra gave him a small bow in return for his own, and got her first look at the interior of his remarkable home. "Oh, my..." 

While the exterior of the house might have looked like any other in the neighbourhood, the interior had obviously been painstakingly transformed into a replica of traditional Japanese styles. Authentic rice straw tatami floors, dark wooden joinery, and sliding panels of paper and wood combined to stunning effect. A stumpy-legged table even sat in the large room adjacent to the entranceway. 

What had caught her eye though, was the exquisite tapestry. It depicted a pair of dancing cranes locked in step on a frozen lake beneath a snowy, conifer blanketed mountain. Hanging opposite the lowered area of the doorway, the colours were so vivid, and the birds so skillfully portrayed that they looked ready to leap off the silk and continue their courtship around the house. It belonged in a gallery, one of the really prestigious ones. 

"Hinata's work," Tosh radiated fatherly pride. "She is in her chamber as we speak." 

"It's wonderful," Claire started forward to get a closer look, but her mother caught her arm before she stepped up onto the carpet. 

"Shoes, dear," Petra drew attention to the neat pairs of discarded shoes lined up against the sunken alcove walling off the exterior doorway. 

Claire followed her Mom's lead and put on a pair of strange green slippers Tosh laid out for her before they all moved to admire the tapestry. 

Up close, the workmanship became even more impressive. The threads were so fine, so precisely woven. It must have taken thousands of hours to make such a beautiful piece of artwork, a masterpiece of fabric. 

"Your daughter is an incredible artist," Claire said in wonder, holding back her desire to touch the soft, cool cloth. She just knew that as beautiful as it looked, it would feel even better to squeeze the fabric between her fingers and run it across her sensitive skin. 

"Thank you," Tosh bowed slightly again. "She weaves more practical items most of the time, but once every few years, she finds inspiration. I do not mean to be rude, ladies, an unexpected visit from ones such as yourselves can only brighten one's day. May I inquire why you have come?" 

Perhaps it was his politeness, or maybe Petra remembered something she'd heard long ago about Japanese customs. She reached into her purse and pulled out a large, brimming chalcedony crystal, presenting it to their host. 

"Please accept this gift for you, or your daughter, in exchange for your welcome and the privilege of seeing such a stunning example of your race's craft," she spoke slowly, formally as the man hesitantly accepted the gift. 

His dark eyes widened at his first touch of the creamy stone, sensing the magic thrumming inside. He placed it reverently on top a nearby wooden cabinet. 

"My daughter will be flattered by your praise and delighted by your gift. Thank you." 

"You're welcome. We came because we're worried something may have happened to our mate. His Maginet phone is unreachable. Not in service." 

"Nani?" The man's alarm was instant and jarring as he slipped into his native tongue. Claire even took a small step backwards, surprised by his gruff tone before he shook himself and continued. "Sorry, sorry. Tell me what has happened, please." 

He already had his own phone out as Petra recounted as much of their strange afternoon as she could without breaking the shocking news about Radek. He tried calling both Chris and Hailey himself, shaking his head as he heard the tone and the woman's voice. 

"It should not be possible," he mused, sparking a series of worried glances between the dragonesses. 

"They're not... oh hell... they're not dead, are they?" Claire wrapped her arm around her Mother's waist and pulled herself close in an attempt to brace them both for the worst. 

"I don't know." He turned and slid aside a wooden door panel, beckoning them to follow him. "Come, we will access the system directly. I have authority to trace their last position in an emergency." 

They stepped inside a dark, spartan room. Apparently, this was his workspace because three huge monitors glowed brightly from a short table in the middle of the room and behind them, a powerful desktop hummed away quietly. Beside the desktop, and connected by what appeared to be a standardised cable, sat a goblin-crafted Maginet Node, complete with quivering antenna. The room held nothing else. 

Neither woman had seen a Node up close before. As Tosh knelt on a cushion to begin his work, they craned their necks to get a better look at the device that was the backbone of their magical communication system. 

It seemed harmless enough, essentially a cuboid box of heavy looking, darkened metal. It had a few interesting features though, namely, the pair of footlong, continually oscillating golden antenna sticking from the top. A small hopper full of tiny gemstones stuck out from one side, providing magical fuel for the ingenious near-instantaneous communication device. A series of cable ports ran along the lip of the opposite side near the top, and only one was occupied, connecting to Tosh's computer. There was no electricity involved in keeping it going then. 

"I heard, the goblin who came up with the idea put a piece of his bone in each Node," Claire whispered to her mother as Tosh logged in and began entering something in a program. "That's how the spell knows to find all the Nodes at the same time."  

"Wrong," the administrator rolled his r a little as he worked. "It was a piece of his brain, kept alive in each one. The spell connects them all so he can talk." 

"That's fucking creepy," Claire gasped. "Oh, sorry, Tosh. I didn't mean to cuss. Um... Michelle would kill to get her hands on one of these." 

"She has already begged me," he chuckled. "Look, I've found them!" 

The two breathed a combined sigh of relief, moving to kneel on either side of him as he brought up some sort of mapping software on the central screen. 

"They weren't kidding about the desert," Petra said as satellite images of a rocky, dry canyon in southern Arizona quickly loaded into focus. Two blue dots orbited each other randomly in the creekbed. "Wow, this is sort of scary accurate. Can you trace us like this all the time?" 

"Only if I consider it an emergency, or I'm ordered to by Reyla in pursuit of a criminal. I have to get screened by a psyker every six months to check my morality you know." 

"I didn't mean it like that. Sorry, Tosh." 

"It's fine. This is interesting, watch. They were here in this valley for several hours this morning, then suddenly, they shoot off to the East and vanish. That is the last data available." He pulled his cursor across a progress bar, slowing and zooming out as the dots began to rapidly track across New Mexico, vanishing altogether somewhere in Eastern Texas. "They must have been going very fast, but it's strange. The phones send a signal instantly if they're damaged or tampered, but no signal was received. Shutdown sends a similar message and forwards to voicemail. They just disappear. I have never heard of an active phone doing such a thing." 

Claire frowned, there was something about the way they moved. So precise and with a gentle southward curve, "Can we see the altitude?" 

"Ah! My genius girl," Petra bubbled. "They're flying, of course." 

It took a few minutes, but Tosh eventually found a way to meaningfully portray the star-bound trajectory Chris and Hailey had taken a few hours before. They all scratched their heads for a while, trying to make sense of the data. 

Petra, as an experienced and enthusiastic flier, knew that they'd flown too fast and much too high for any sane dragon. Tosh though came up with a new hypothesis for how the Maginet network worked, realising that their data cut out just after one hundred kilometres above the earth, the edge of the atmosphere. It was as he was searching the human internet for these figures that Claire put it all together. 

"He's taken the little nerd to space," she realised. 

"What? How?" Petra wondered. "They don't have any suits, and she can't ride him in space." 

"In one of the damn bubbles they're always practising with. It has to be." 

While the thought of their mate galavanting around in the void didn't exactly engender calm in either dragoness, it was at least good to know that he wasn't outright dead. They could also safely rule out the possibility of demonic involvement. 

In the end, they thanked Tosh for his assistance and called a cab to get them back across town in time to collect Amy from school. On the way, they put their heads together with single-minded focus toward busting his balls when he returned. 

*** 

Fine, powdery dust billowed softly out from underneath the perfectly curved surface of the orb as they touched down with a jolt. 

It was a bit more of an impact than Chris had expected, the speed of their descent was hard for his dragon's flight instincts to judge in the light, alien gravity. The magic that assisted his ungainly body in the skies could still propel him through the void, but without wind flowing under his wings, it felt unnatural and disorientating. He wondered how Petra would fare, she was a peerless flier, or so he'd heard anyway. He must do something about that oversight before her pregnancy got too far along. 

"Magnificent desolation," Hailey parroted those famous words, nervously flexing up on her toes beside his enormous form. In the Moon's weak grasp, her movement magnified to a small hop, and she scrabbled for a firmer grip on his foreleg. "Eeek! Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. I heard somewhere that California actually claims it as a park, we could get in trouble." 

The dragon swivelled his neck through a complete panorama near the dome of their sphere. He took in everything, the bright, barren surface scattered with rocks and divots, the brutal sun beating down. He dared not look up into the darkness of space, because it hurt his eyes to look back down at the lunar surface afterwards through widened pupils. It was that bright. The ground rose behind them to the edge of a small impact crater, shallow and maybe one hundred feet across. The real kicker and the reason they were here was dead ahead. 

"You think I give a fuck about the State of California?" he rumbled protectively. "If you want a souvenir, we'll get you a souvenir. You deserve it." 

They both looked out through the dimming effect of the orb at the decent stage left behind by Apollo Eleven, still wrapped in gaudy, golden-red insulation foil that was only slightly dusty despite decades of abandonment. 

"It's that box over there by the module, right?" he confirmed with a nod to the item in question. It rested on the footprint disturbed dust at the base of the lander, surrounded by a haphazard pile of what could only be called moon junk. All the stuff the astronauts had thrown out of their craft to make weight for as many samples as they could lift off the surface. Chris thought he even saw a dirty boot sticking out from behind a blocky white object with the NASA logo on it. 

"I'm not sure honestly," she admitted. "That could be astronaut poop." 

"Wonderful," he snorted. 

He undertook a final check the orb's parameters, the last thing he needed was it rolling away with Hailey trapped inside. The protective flight membrane closed over his eyes, and he contracted the muscles around the ear slits at the base of his smallest backwards-slanted horns. A series of slow deep breaths followed, which he held with lungs empty. Finally, let himself be allowed through that Ether barrier once again, and made the first new footprint the Moon had seen in over forty years. 

He sank much deeper in the powdery dust than he'd expected, but forged onward with the limited oxygen he had stored in his blood and tissues. 

The unrestrained sun struck his scales with palpable force, refracting dazzlingly and sending a quiver up his flanks as an undeniable heat began to build. This was not the happy, gentle light that had greeted his mornings on the farm; it was a naked nuclear furnace. Perhaps it somehow knew what he planned. He squinted, closing his scaled eyelids to slits. 

In contrast to the scorching heat, anything not touched by fusion light was deathly cold, like he'd dunked in Reyla's shadefrost. He was incredibly grateful of his dragon's internal genitalia, for he dreaded to think what might have befallen a pair of underslung jewels. 

Chris couldn't hear a sound as he took his first steps, but an uncomfortable sensation grew all throughout his body, especially his joints. Magical regeneration kicked into high gear, fighting the effects of degassing in his thick blood. There was no nitrogen left in his system though, so it appeared would be okay for a little while longer. 

Hailey clung to the tip of his purple tail as it finally slipped away, but he didn't look back. She could see his huge paw prints in the surface just outside, an eternal testament to his willingness to risk naked space for the sake of her little trinkets. She felt suddenly childish, yet warmed by his devotion. A desire to immortalise the moment sprung to life in her heart. Her backpack almost bounced in the low gravity, but she quickly found her Maginet phone and began filming the historic event despite the angry red symbol flashing in the notification bar. 

Chris' vision was perfect as he hopped forward gingerly in the light gravity. Each step sent him sailing, and his eyes darting to judge where is feet would land next among the small rocks. Dragon instinct told him to raise his wings for stability in this strange quasi-flight, but he knew they would only get in the way. It might be fun to bounce around creating little puffy clouds as he went but he didn't have the luxury to explore. 

It barely took more than fifteen seconds to reach the discarded module. He was about to nudge aside what must have been a space suit life support system and wade into the small field of debris when his prize made itself known very clearly to his dragon's greedy sonar. It wasn't the box, which probably was poop after all. There was something gold in the bleached, half buried pouch behind the astronaut's discarded space shoe. 

He snatched it up between two claws and prepared to depart. That presented a small challenge, and he was about to try leaping backwards, so his tail didn't accidentally knock over the lander when something caught his eye in the soil on the other side. He snaked his way gingerly around the glittering decent stage, becoming conscious now that his empty lungs were beginning to protest. 

A thin metal pole lay in the dust, surrounded by the astronaut's footprints. Curiosity demanded he give it a gentle tug, revealing a bleached, tattered, scrap of fabric attached to one end by a shorter, perpendicular rod. It took a moment for him to recognise the disintegrating remnants of the mission's flag. It had laid there for decades, half buried in the lunar soil. The sun had almost cooked it away to nothing. 

That wouldn't do at all, magic surged up out of his core. His sentiment might have been brought on by lack of oxygen, or maybe he was just more patriotic than he'd imagined. Either way, he stood the now vibrant, spangled nylon back up, taking care to push the aluminium rod deep in the regolith and tamp down around its base with his big mitts. The dragon thought it a fitting atonement for his pilferage of the historic site. 

Unbeknownst to him, Hailey caught the entire episode in digital memory, including the respectful little bob of his head before he started loping back to her. Even as a massive purple dragon, she thought he was just fucking adorable. 

Reentry to the orb stripped him clean of the clingy dust, but his sensitive snout still picked up the hint of a burned smell, almost like the lingering scent in the BIA firing range. Huffing proudly, he dropped their loot next to Hailey's hiking boots. 

Beaming lovingly, her intent to launch up in the low gravity and hug his neck was clear. 

"Don't," he warned in his deep dragon rumble. "My scales are burning hot." 

He shook his entire body like a wet dog, trying to rid himself of the maddening tingle. Truthfully, he was very relieved to be back inside their orb. The dichotomy of extreme temperatures he'd endured was at the limit of even a dragon's fortitude. Half of him felt pan-fried, while the other half wanted to jump into the damn pan to warm up. His breath was still coming fast and hard. Holding one's lungs empty was not so easy as holding them full, but it was preferable to them exploding in vacuum.

--------------------------------------------
"Holy cow, you got it!" Her exclamation drew his attention away from the shivering of his recovering body. "Look! It's the goodwill disk and the Apollo One patches." 

"Is that good?" he wondered at the little black disk lined with silver that she'd shaken into the folds of her jacket. It didn't seem so extraordinary, neither did the colourful fabric patches that landed beside them. 

"Show some respect," She scowled at his lack of reverence and shook the satchel out. "If I'm right, this will get your attention." 

Something bright and reflective fell out. 

"That's more like it," the dragon bent his nose to sniff at the golden, prickly looking replica of a leafy stick. A few military medals lay beside it, and he peered at her for clarification. 

"It's supposed to be an olive branch," she shook her head at his cocked expression. "You know, a peace symbol?" 

"Well, the craftsmanship leaves a bit wanting, don't you think? What about these?" 

"The medals of two heroic cosmonauts, given to the crew of Apollo 11 by their families. Komarov and Gagarin, I think. They would have loved to make it here," her admiration was evident as she straightened the gold and red medal ribbons into a neat row and placed the patches beside them. Fallen heroes of two great nations, their spirits rested here together, united by their courage and a fierce dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration. 

"Shouldn't we leave them here then?" he asked. 

"No. They're our proof. I think they'd be happy to contribute to what we're doing. Besides, we can always return them, can't we?" Hailey folded her jacket around the items that held more than a little significance for her and bundled them into her backpack, along with the dirty satchel in which they'd lain. "Okay, we'd better move off a little way if you still want to try this." 

He did. After a brief rendezvous with their reserve supply of air, they did just that. 

Chris floated them upward a few hundred feet and used his dragon's flight magic almost exclusively to soar slowly across the battered landscape. With the orb slaved to maintain its position around him, it was easy to pretend that it wasn't there. Hailey took little encouragement to climb aboard his back and participate in the illusion of flight, calling out objects of interest to circle or skim low over. It was exhilarating, and they both enjoyed a half hour of joyful bonding in the fulfilment of her fantasy. 

She could have happily stayed with him like that forever. Astride the base of his sinuous neck, anything seemed possible as they floated effortlessly past ancient volcanoes and across the darkened sea of long-cooled molten rock. Given time, she would have loved to sail her dragon to the craters of the south pole and search for frozen water, trapped there in the eternal darkness. It would have to wait for another day. She leaned forward to kiss his resplendent purple scales and cement the moment in her memory with his spicy, smoky, cinnamon-infused scent. 

She'd easily recognised the Sea of Tranquility and used it to guide them to the Apollo Eleven landing site. They soared northward after their departure, skirting the timeworn, irregular mountains that pronounced the edge of the lunar highlands. She marvelled at the satellite's violent geographic history, and the absence of atmosphere, water, and life to sooth the scars. 

At her direction, they set down again at the edge of a vast crater bowl near the side of the mountains. She could clearly make out the base of those boulder-strewn slopes. The jagged ridgelines towered some miles above them. 

Out on the mare plane below, she wondered at the parallel lines of rilles, skunked inward by some ancient seismic event. Amongst those massive, uniform formations she spotted an irregular, gouge-like disturbance in the plain. It was a feature scientists were still trying to explain back home. Some claimed the last throes of volcanism formed them before the mantle cooled, others said it was impossible. Here she was, looking at it from not much more than sixty miles away. 

Turning to peek over the smooth lip of the crater, she recoiled at the complete darkness of the shadow reaching out across the hollow's smoothed floor. It looked intent on swallowing the uprising of defiant rock at the centre of the old impact site. 

Distance was so deceiving up here without trees or grass or anything to take as reference. Rocks and boulders were almost useless. Her eyes tried to tell her that a brief scramble down the dark slope and an enjoyable bound across a mile or so would put her at the base of that cute geographic formation well before the shadow arrived. 

The reality was that she would probably tumble for an hour down the crater's bowl, cartwheeling uncontrollably across several kilometres of deceptively steep, rock-strewn slope. If she did manage to get to the bottom unharmed, a trek of more than a day would await her to reach the mountain at the crater's locus. 

From up here, what looked like tiny pebbles strewn about on that flat plane below were no doubt the few dark boulders much larger than she. False interpretation of her senses in the alien, low gravity environment would be far too easy. 

Even with the best space suit, she would exhaust herself and perish trying to struggle back up to the crater's edge. The fine lunar dust would sink and slip treacherously beneath her feet. She would mire, or tumble back down to the flat to die of thirst or more likely suffocation. She shuddered at the thought and squeezed the dragon close. 

"What's wrong?" he asked, low and comforting as he raked a pickup-sized black orb back and forth across the Moon's reflective grey sands. 

"Nothing, just thinking up worst case scenarios for fun." 

"That's my brilliant, freaky little bison," he chuckled, disregarding his efforts in order to distract her with hot snuffles and a few affectionate, reptilian licks. "That incredible mind of yours is easily as sexy as the rest of you, but try turning it to something brighter. For instance, remember that you're the first woman on the Moon." 

She batted his pestering pink organ away playfully and hugged his broad, adder-like snout. 

"I'm not really on the Moon. I'm in a bubble. Thank you though." 

"A technicality, and I'll fight anyone who tries to deny you the honour." His chivalry was somewhat ruined by his draconic affection, rubbing his nostrils over the denim hiding her ripening womanhood. He just couldn't get enough of her small, bronzed body. 

"Best boyfriend in the solar system," she sighed happily, scratching behind the curve of his mighty jaw. 

"Mhhhrrrmmmbbb," he almost nickered in pleasure, his hind legs twitching in reflex as she discovered a dragon soft spot. "Wait. The solar system? That's a downgrade." 

"Take me to dinner and to bed on the international space station like you promised, and I'll consider you for a promotion," she teased impishly before patting his huge head and sitting back. "Okay, back to work big guy. That hydrogen isn't going to fuse by itself." 

"Tell that to the Sun," he quipped, stumping her as he resummoned his concentration. 

"But that's..." 

"Nope, gotcha." 

"Shut up!" she giggled. "I suppose that's what I get for helping you learn all that stuff." 

This initial collection of material was easy compared to the painstaking preparation of the protective shell they occupied. All he had to do was gobble up moon dust, then provide heat and pressure until the sturdy silicate regolith began to melt and dissociate into atoms. The plan was for him to then spew everything except hydrogen back out onto the airless rock. 

However, it turned out the Moon's soil was remarkably hydrogen poor. It also required far more magic than he would have liked to heat the resistant stuff. Ratcheting down the dimensions of the orb to compress the substrate only helped so much. He suspected this was because it was already so cold and stable in the form of his starting material. 

Before he was ready to begin venting the first waste elements, he'd cursed himself for not merely dragging a fifty-gallon drum of water along for the ride from Earth. Deuterium would have been nice, but it almost seemed too easy to test his abilities on the dream fusion fuel. They were here for the holy grail, to steal the Sun's fire. 

When he thought the contents of the orb were good and molten, he altered the orb's barrier to allow oxygen out. It escaped as a rush of superheated gas, barely visible to his eyes more from the heat it carried than any property of the element. Afterwards came the metals and other elements, glowing plumes of molten iron, silicon, calcium, and magnesium. He didn't need to do it one by one that way, but it was fun. After seeing the first long, brilliant streak shoot off under pressure in the low gravity to lie gleaming and cooling on the barren soil, he was hooked. The phallic comparison brought a stupid, toothy grin to his face. 

In the end, he was left with a pitiful amount of what was supposed to be the most abundant element in the universe, and he was forced to repeat the process. Hailey argued that they didn't need much for a test run, but he wanted to be confident that his magic was up to the task of containing a reaction that was worth the effort of harvesting. 

The slope near the crater's lip was littered with brilliant metallic trails and splatters when he was finally ready to start. Hailey hoped that NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter wouldn't be able to resolve the strange details of the reflective surface he'd created, but there was a real risk that its instruments might pick up the release of so much free oxygen. 

There was no guidebook they could consult on starting up a tiny star, and this was undoubtedly the only shot they would get today. But based on what she knew of the conditions required for fusion, and what she'd seen of Chris' abilities, Hailey gave him the best advice she could. They discussed at length the steps he would have to monitor and the conditions he would need to maintain. She couldn't help pointing out that a healthy dose of her Muons might simply start the reaction right there and then if he hadn't somehow decided it was 'cheating.' 

The ten or so kilograms of hydrogen he'd collected had been allowed to cool to remove any final impurities. Ready to begin, he let the impenetrable black bubble expand a to a size only slightly smaller than that of their own, and started to pour in energy. 

The little atom-duets of hydrogen gas vibrated angrily, crashing into each other and rebounding off the walls of their prison. Faster and faster they careened as the temperature inside skyrocketed at the expense of the dragon's vast magic. Before long, the molecules had too much energy to remain paired, breaking into single atoms of protium. 

Battling through substantial drain on his reserves, Chris continued his magical barrage, imparting as much kinetic energy as he could to everything inside that zone in the Ether. His senses were focused entirely on that region now, and he felt the abstract tipping point when electron and proton began to dissociate. He had his plasma, his ion soup, and that was the first vital step. 

Where the first few atoms went, the teeming multitude soon followed like bleating sheep. It was a fitting analogy actually, those proton sheep shedding their electron fleece en masse in the dragon's flames. 

He switched focus from heating to compressing. With all his might, he forced that controlled zone of Ether to shrink. Inside, zillions of zipping charged particles screamed their protest, fighting back against his containment. He'd given them energy, and now they used it to push against his slowly restricting cage. 

His mastery of the Ether was not so easily challenged though. He snarled, frightening Hailey from her awestruck observation of the steadily shrinking black sphere. She patted his trembling flank reassuringly, but he didn't respond, too focused on exerting his will. The orb, once big enough to engulf a small cottage, now dwindled to the size of a medicine ball and showed no sign of stopping. There was nothing diminished about the contents though, they were just forced to occupy less space, to become incredibly dense. 

Those unimaginably small particles hated to come near one another, but before long, they had no choice. They were going so fast now, and there was so little room to slide by each other with their naturally repulsive forces. In the end, it was just a game of numbers. 

Colliding head-on, proton struck proton in a subatomic thunderclap of minuscule proportion but momentous import. A diproton staggered away, limping and shivering and finally breaking back into two protons. Nothing of true import had happened yet, protons don't really get along after all, so it was no wonder they didn't stay stuck together that often. Chris was still waiting, but now, the same collision was starting to occur many millions of times per second. The more it happened, the higher his chances of success, so he shrank the orb further, approaching the size of a baseball. 

Eventually, one drunken diproton jumped the queue by a billion odd years. This time, something new and very improbable happened deep, deep inside one of the conjoined protons. An elementary particle, a quark, changed allegiances. 

He saw it. No, he more felt it abstractly. They probably defied direct observation after all. Still, it was what he'd been struggling to experience, to capture. 

In that momentous fraction of an instant, a positron was born. Infant antimatter, squalling, red-faced, and ready to blow the world to hell. 

Inside the now two-inch span of cosmos he owned, he worked his magic. It had happened once; therefore, it could happen again. He coaxed with his powerful intention, whispering to the other quarks that such a thing might not be so bad. Very gently, he stacked the deck so that the odds of such a fundamentally improbable thing occurring again shifted just a whisker to the favourable. 

Even in the moment of that first positron's creation, the tiny speck of positive antimatter annihilated. It was the antithesis of electrons, and it was in a target rich environment. 

From the resulting miniature explosion, two burly photons scattered, the nasty looking sort you'd cross the street to avoid. They fled away from the scene, leaving the surviving proton to clutch the husk of its erstwhile partner. 

The proton soon realised that something had changed. Its buddy seemed different, no longer a hyped up asshole like itself, and they would get along just fine. But sadly, it was not to be. Holding that brand spanking neutron close, the isotope deuterium had only a few seconds left. 

Another lone proton crashed in from the side, sparking an explosion of released atomic binding energy far greater than even the positron had managed with its own destruction. Chris' probing magic sensed helium-3, and he'd officially made a star. 

Chris drew his awareness back slowly as the interior of the orb flickered like a hesitant lightbulb in his mind's eye. Still deathly black on the outside, the churning purple he'd just started getting used to in the Ether pulsed with new, white-hot brilliance. 

He thought those atoms trapped inside had been fast, hot, and angry before, but he'd had no idea. More diprotons began to decay, unleashing heat, gamma photons, and occasionally something more exotic. More deuterium formed, and in turn fused into helium-3, releasing an incredible amount of heat. The resulting rise in temperature forced the swirling star-stew inside his orb to burn even faster. 

The light bulb flicked on, shedding a blinding, but distinctly lifeless radiance. It drowned out all trace of the purple from his orb, almost blinding him to its presence. It painfully saturated his very magical senses and bathed the already barren Ether in pure, hot, dead, light. 

Grinning as toothily as a mad shark, his awareness crashed back into his tired body with a draconian trill of victory. 

The reaction wasn't complete yet. In the Sun, it might take several centuries for that helium-3 to become helium-4 but he'd overcome the true hurdle and proven the efficacy of his magic. 

"You did it?!" Hailey launched high into their low-pressure oxygen, rejoicing with the dragon. 

"We did it, Hailey!" The dragon laughed deep and joyous, catching her playfully in his paws. She joined his laughter as he coiled his body into a dragon cocoon around her. "It was so subtle, but I felt the up-quark change into a down. It's incredible, I never would have thought something so tiny could do something so huge. Heck, I never would have understood what a quark is without your help." 

"I'm still not entirely sure either of us understands that model," she teased good-naturedly. Almost skipping in her excitement, she set upon his exposed, creamy belly for a vigorous petting. "You must have felt something you recognised or understood in there if you made it work. Chris this is huge, just think about it! I've been doing some research, and I might have found the perfect place for our anti-desertification idea." 

"Hold your horses my high-spirited heifer," he laughed at her enthusiasm, nudging at her to continue his reward. He was definitely going to spend more time as a dragon if he could get pampered like this. 

"Ha! I'm jumping a few steps, aren't I?" 

"Maybe one or two. We've got to harness the reaction first, and I can't believe how much energy is in those little bastards," he admitted. "At least now that the parameters on that orb are set, it's no hassle to maintain." 

"It looked tough when you started shrinking the volume. It must be close to the density of the sun's core in there you know." 

"Really?" He swivelled his neck to regard the two-inch onyx orb hovering out above the lunar dust. Against the background of space, it was near impossible to spot. It didn't seem probable that he could achieve that sort of compaction. 

"I did the math," she confirmed and clambered up onto her his back once again. "I don't mean to ruin the party. But if it's working, we should get home before people start worrying." 

"Okay, let me just... oh crap." 

"What?!" her tone sobered instantly. After one close call that day the last thing they needed was a problem now. 

He ran his senses toward the orb but had to shy away from the nuclear fire within. The energy bottled inside had increased by several orders of magnitude. 

"I didn't think about what happens to all that energy if its kept bottled up." The dragon's tail flicked nervously around their orb as he considered his rebellious creation. "Not even the Sun does that." 

"No, it certainly doesn't, but stay calm," she spoke, keeping her voice level and petting his neck as she tried to think through to a solution. "I should have thought of this. In the generation scenarios, we were planning on harvesting at least heat and neutrons. Has it really become such a problem in a few minutes?" 

"Well, it's painful to even glance at magically. We should definitely do something before it gets worse. I'll try turning the quark balance in the protons back to normal, okay?" 

"Do it. No more new fuel will at least slow it down," Hailey nodded gravely. They could salvage the situation, and if anything, this upset just proved that his incredible orbs could withstand almost anything. If they were trying to build a fusion power plant, they would let some of that heat and radiation escape to be collected rather than cook off like a pressure furnace. 

Chris had to grope blindly in the Ether for his orb. His purple energy was utterly invisible, washed out by the barrage of so many high energy particles trapped in a tight space. He bumped into by accident, catching a clumsy, tenuous grip. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 14|
--------------------------------------------
His first order of business was to do precisely as he'd promised, cutting off the magical catalyst for further fusion. The quarks would resume their usual aloofness. 

The problem was the deuterium, heat, hard radiation, and other more exotic particles that had already been created in those few minutes of celebration. The enormous heat released in those nuclear fusions had been completely trapped. Every particle inside was vibrating faster, colliding harder and more frequently. 

It was a hungry feedback loop that promised to burn so bright he would lose any chance of exercising control. Already it seared his senses, and the deuterium alone was quite happy to continue reacting for minutes to come. More concerning was that the helium created was finding it much easier to take the next step up the periodic table than he'd assumed. It wasn't going to stop. 

He lost his grip on it, his magic retreating from the elemental rage. Feeling half cooked by the effort, he spent several agonising seconds swimming in that scorching light before he caught it once more. There was really only one thing he could think to do before it evaded him once more. He knew he wouldn't have the strength to master it again, so he put it to an abrupt end. 

A scintillating lance burst into the dark void. A vivid, momentary tear, angled low across the lunar horizon. Space itself seemed to rupture and recoil from the unprovoked savagery. 

Around them, there was nothing but pure, untamed light. It was a terrible thing, the violence of a coronal mass ejection miniaturised, enslaved, and finally set loose. 

Dust exploded in every direction, fleeing whoever had been foolish enough to try taming that power. In front of the tiny orb, the very surface of the moon shattered. Rock and dust crumbling to constituent atoms, turned to gas by even the proximity to the beam's path. It would leave behind a glowing scar almost two hundred feet long. 

Hailey screamed wordless terror as she clung to him for dear life. Her eyes were squeezed shut but it was still so bright that it hurt. Even though their orb stood firm, blocking a portion of it, it felt like the photons bypassed her eyes entirely, burrowing directly into her brain. Sheltering behind him, she prayed their larger globe held, that it only let in the comparatively gentle, visible wavelength photons rather than the invisible ones that would tear them to shreds on a microscopic level. 

The Moon shuddered beneath them, silent, but clearly protesting their intrusion. She was supposed to be retired, her wild youth was long behind her now. Yet this coruscating intrusion almost lopped a mountain off her face and tugged jarringly at the leash keeping her bound to her larger, more beautiful sister. 

It ended as suddenly as it had begun. No more than three seconds had passed, and the cold, boundless forgiveness of darkness rushed back to comfort the shaken Moon. The Sun seemed to brighten once again, answering the short-lived challenge to its supremacy. 

"It's done," Chris rumbled defeatedly, watching dust start to settle across the Moon's new scar. Empty now, the little black orb was still hanging there. Not visible from their vantage, a pinprick size section on the far side still glowed softly as the last of the trapped particles escaped. "Once again, I apologise. It seems today is a day to be both awed and humbled by the universe." 

"You didn't... was it anywhere near Earth?" she blinked, her sight still scarred by the afterimage of that initial razor's slice of brilliance." 

"No. I aimed it away as best I could before I lost my connection to it. Perhaps I should have just left it be, but it was so strong, it wouldn't have stopped on its own." 

"Please take me home," she whispered, pulling herself closer against his trunk-like neck. 

*** 

Chris awoke to the patter of small bare feet on the wooden floor. The hushed voices of his dragonesses floated nebulously in the background, making his lips twitch toward a sleepy smile. 

Hailey's warmth pressed satisfyingly down on his chest, short hair tickling his chin. 

The pattering approached rapidly. With a soft groan, he braced for Immi's not so insubstantial weight to descend abruptly. Instead, the footsteps became delicate, and someone small leaned on the end of the couch they'd collapsed onto last night. 

"He's still asleep," Amy loud-whispered in an attempt to both appear innocent and rouse him up at the same time. 

"I'm up," he grumbled, pulling his hands out from under their light blanket to swipe away a fleck of crusty sleep and stretch his protesting muscles. He needed so much more rest. 

Amy scampered away, leaving him to consider his almost drunken recollection of how he'd ended up there. 

They'd arrived back much later than he'd planned last night, wholly shattered from their excursion and emotionally drained to boot. The lingering presence of the sun during their Moon excursion had bestowed a false sense of time's passage. 

Back in his human form, with solid ground beneath his feet, he'd tiredly believed that his phone's empty message bank put him in the clear. But Annabel was waiting up, launching into his arms even as he tried to half carry Hailey inside. 

She took one look at his face and somehow knew he'd had a hellish day. Perhaps it was the fierceness with which he embraced her, or the thickness in his voice as he apologised for her worry. She decided to spare him the haranguing she'd almost memorised. There had been plenty of time to practice in the hours spent wondering if he was going to make it home. Faced with the forlorn state they returned in, she was just relieved to have him back at all. 

His First propped them up at the kitchen bar as she reheated leftover stew. Their exhausted recount of the lunar expedition boggled belief. She had to admit she didn't understand half of the technical points Hailey added to his retelling with her head resting on her arms. It all sounded too far-fetched, even as Bartholomew helped her perfectly melt the grated cheese on their servings with a careless wave of her hand. 

She didn't tell them about Radek, about Michelle and the others working through the night. If she did, she knew he would feel obligated to walk back out the door, to help despite his obvious exhaustion. So, she fed them and got them ready for bed, loaning Hailey one of his old t-shirts from before his growth spurt. It was well past midnight when she slipped naked into her own bed and pulled Immi close, listening to her shallow, peaceful breathing. 

He'd slept with Hailey on the couch, of course, they both needed that. 

"Good morning," Petra's voice sounded distinctly cooler than usual, containing a hint of mockery as her face appeared above him. "You two missed out on yesterday's drama, and there's something new I think you might be interested to see. Scooch, lazy bones." 

Damn, he had some serious ass kissing, grovelling, massaging, and general slavery to do. There was nothing for it, but his consolation wasn't insubstantial. Petra's curvaceous bottom was tailor-made for kissing, and the rest of her deserved just as much attention. 

"Sleep," Hailey protested grumpily as he slowly sat up. Still exhausted from their ordeal, she didn't bother to do much more than turn her head so the other side of his chest could be drooled on too. 

He wrapped the blanket tighter around them and patted the freed spot for Petra to occupy. She was wearing a magenta night robe which flounced around her figure, and her beautiful silver hair still had that sexy morning look about it. The sheepskin ugg boots warming her feet did something for him too, perhaps it was the number of times they'd rested on his shoulders. 

"All warmed up." He summoned as much tired enthusiasm as he could, half expecting her to give him the cold shoulder and sit on a recliner instead. She didn't, and he pulled her close against him his side, scenting her neck and free-flowing locks with a tender sigh. "I'm truly sorry, my love. I claim stupidity as my defence." 

"That's a start," she snuggled closer under his arm. 

Claire and Amy joined them soon with bowls of cereal that made his stomach start to churn ominously. They still had on their pyjamas as well. He wondered how early it was that Annabel wasn't yet up and working on breakfast. That thought sounded incredibly entitled, even for a dragon, but he'd been conditioned like a Pavlovian hound, damn it. 

Samantha's daughter boldly took up position on his other side, resigning his amused redhead mate to the end seat. 

"Good morning, munchkin," he spoke to Claire but returned the raven-haired girl's inquisitive gaze, employing his most winning smile. "And a very good morning to you too, Amy." 

"Silly," Amy chimed as Claire pretended not to have almost choked on her granola at his little joke. Her dark, curious eyes were clearly fascinated by the mess of short blonde hair on his chest and the petite woman it belonged to. "Who's that? Did she stay up all night worrying about you too?" 

"I ah..." He was lost, her innocent words smiting directly to the core of his guilt. He found his throat thickening painfully as he searched for words. Petra only snorted her approval when he turned to her for assistance. 

The clap of their high-five jolted him from guilty paralysis, and he discovered the conspirators grinning wickedly at him over their cereal. He shook his head in defeat, still struggling to overcome that sudden upwelling. 

"Perfect delivery," Claire congratulated her tiny accomplice. "That's exactly the look we wanted to see on his silly face." 

"Thanks!" The cute bundle of mischief beamed, eager for praise. Claire was fun and gorgeous, and she didn't treat her like a kid the whole time, so Amy was happy to help prank Chris. She hoped he might become a friend too, she'd already learned the advantage of big friends at her previous school. He was really kind and handsome, but there was something strange about these babysitters. She didn't know quite what yet, but she was going to get to the bottom of it. They would all be better friends once she understood what was going on. 

"That's enough teasing for now," Petra only just kept her chuckle under control but gave his thick bicep a reassuring, much-appreciated squeeze. "It's must be almost eight am over there, put the news on." 

Chris wasn't a fan of news shows before he found out he was a dragon. Now they just seemed utterly trite. He wondered if the over-enthusiastic droning of the anchors wasn't really another punishment cooked up by his mates. Sleep deprivation was technically torture after all. 

He zoned out, missing the details of the absurd scandal some senator found himself embroiled in. That was the most important news today, was it? Not the looming collapse of global ecosystems, rampant inequality in their justice system, or even the fact that no one had travelled to or from Indonesia for more than a month now? His head lolling back onto the leather headrest, and he lazily supposed that the omission of that last one was probably a good thing. Hailey's warmth and weight felt nice. He'd very nearly dozed off when Petra nudged him. 

The bubbly female anchor beamed at the camera 

"You've probably already seen the chilling viral video that swept through social media yesterday sparking confusion and speculation." She said it as if their own station hadn't mongered the exact same rumours all night. 

"That's right, Penny," the handsome male lead confirmed in a gratingly cliche cadence. "We've heard all sorts of theories about the origin of the clip, which appeared to show what has been labelled a supernatural event." 

Chris was wide awake now. 

"However, the predictions of several experts have been proven correct this morning, and we're proud to announce our exclusive update on this compelling story." The woman didn't miss a beat, and Chris couldn't help drawing a comparison between her and a skillfully piloted marionette. "In a moment, we'll cross over to a live report from our correspondent in Argentina which promises to explain it all." 

"I just can't believe it. Argentina! And Claudia Hampson is actually on the movie set! The actors who took the world by storm yesterday in a shocking, and what some are calling irresponsible publicity stunt, are preparing for another incredible day of filming as we speak. I tell you what, Penny, they say the studio job is a good gig, but today, I want to be down there watching the magic happen." 

The blonde anchor laughed, and at least it seemed she found some genuine humour in his comment. 

"Folks, would you believe that yesterday, our very own Jim Henderson was actually questioning if the clip was somehow real?" 

"Now, now," he chuckled back. "I only pointed out that the quality of the special effects seemed much better than what we've seen out of Hollywood recently. In case the viewers at home haven't seen this incredible piece of cinema yet, we'll play it for you in a moment." 

"We caution that viewer discretion is advised," Penny's tone waxed serious. "The segment contains graphic violence that some may find offensive or disturbing. We can now assure you that the events you're about to see were staged by professionals for the purposes of entertainment, but they may not be suitable for small children or sensitive individuals." 

"I've already seen it," Amy preempted Chris as he opened his mouth. "It's awesome." 

The stronger protest he'd been crafting anyway died between his brain and his lips as he watched Radek step out of the bus into the unsteady frame. 

"Jesus!" Chris leapt from the sofa as the carnage began, dumping Hailey unceremoniously in his place. For the first time since he was a kid, he sat on the floor, glued to the TV, so it filled his whole vision. He barely even noticed when Annabel sank down beside him in a black slip and tiny khaki shorts, her hand running soothingly up and down the tense muscles of his lower back. 

He was still recovering from the shock of it all when the correspondent's live cross began. The distracting brunette was flawlessly made up against the early morning backdrop of dry prairie. She wore a thin, form-fitting white dress with blue trim and an enormous belt snug around her tapered waist. The dress had an off-shoulder neckline, display an eye-catching amount of sumptuous, bronzed bounty. It was practical of course, no doubt such a garment would help her stay cool on what was shaping up to be a scorching day. 

"Penny, behind me you might recognise the stretch of road that will be cordoned off for a second day as the cast and crew of this ambitious project rush to complete their filming of this critical action scene." Sure enough, there was the bus around which the battle had raged. There were no bullet holes or blood splatters, and a team of riggers could be seen hauling cables and lighting equipment into position. "It's called shaky cam, and although you might have seen it before in the movie theatre, you've never seen it quite like this." 

At that exact moment, Radek walked behind the woman, briefcase, suit, and all. He paused briefly in-shot to wave happily at the camera and wink just like he had in the previous film. It was chilling. 

As the woman continued to talk, answering the anchor's inane questions as best she could, they rolled some prepared footage. 

A somewhat cross looking elf sat in a trailer before a mirror surrounded by little lights. Two women dabbed brushes artfully at her face as she fidgeted in her dark leather costume. Those ears though, he might have sworn one of them flicked in annoyance. The shot panned to the man who Chris had watched brutally killed just minutes before. He was getting the finishing touches done on his mangled, bloody stump of a hand. He turned animatedly to the camera and waved it around in mock, exaggerated agony before laughing heartily and giving it back to the scowling makeup artist who began scolding him in Spanish. 

Next, he saw two sweaty men in bodysuits standing in front of the deflated form of their dank haired, monstrous costume. They nodded along as a curly-topped, quintessential director type, acted out the exact sequence of movements he required from them with exaggerated sweeps of imagined tail and claw. In the background, he caught a flash of a tall, dark-skinned woman, out of focus but suspiciously beautiful nonetheless. 

Finally, there was the almost furtive interview with the lead effects artist, through an interpreter of course. The untanned, grad student looking dude spoke of some proprietary video editing software that he and his team at the University of Buenos Aires were developing. They backed up the claim with a few tantalising snippets of how they'd modelled and imposed the wolf to battle with the hideous swamp creature based on documentary footage. 

"What the fuck," he breathed. It was almost believable. "But I..." 

"Jim, the most incredible part is that the whole project will be filmed exclusively on the latest smartphones." The correspondent beamed winningly at the camera. "I've been told by the producer that the unstable footage and handheld perspective helps trick our eyes to miss the subtle traces left behind in special effects. Not only that, they're saving the budget hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive camera equipment! When the cellphone manufacturer heard about the project, they sent the crew an entire pallet of their latest devices which film in 4k resolution." 

"That's incredible, Claudia. Are you having fun down there?" 

Hogwash. Absolute BS. 

"No shit it's incredible. It's fucking unbelievable!" Chris scoffed. His eyes narrowed, and he turned to his First. "Where's Michelle?" 

"I didn't want to worry you last night," Annabel kissed his jaw apologetically. "You were so tired, and I knew you'd go running off down there." 

"Oh my God. You guys know then, he's a dem... about Radek?" he looked around at Petra and Claire who nodded gravely. "And I was missing..." 

Hailey was frowning, still waking up and not comprehending the full picture without that critical information on Radek's nature. 

"We were worried sick," Claire pouted, cradling her pregnant tummy defensively. 

"Ha!" Susan emerged from her bedroom, taking in the situation at a glance. "Don't let these two harlots fool you, honey. They knew you weren't involved by about three in the afternoon, and they've been plotting ever since." 

"I wouldn't call what he was up to exactly safe, Susan," Petra countered, only mildly peeved that their ballbusting was exposed. There would be plenty of time to continue in the privacy of her bed. "They'll be reporting on that next if I'm not mistaken." 

"Uh oh," Chris murmured, turning his attention back to the last of the report. Had he thought what they'd done would go unnoticed? He hadn't really had a chance to consider it yet, but he doubted anyone could point a finger specifically at him. 

Claire sat back against the leather, regarding their young, ever attentive charge. The conversation was sloppy and unlikely to get better. However, ejecting the girl from the room without a choice wouldn't engender trust. She would have hated that at a young age. 

"Amy, remember what I said last time you stayed over?" she asked the young girl. 

"About not telling anyone the stuff I hear when I stay over, except to Mom?" 

"That's exactly right. We probably shouldn't be having a grown-up talk like this while you're around, but you're very mature, and I think you can handle it. What do you say? We can go get a hot chocolate or something if you'd prefer?" 

"I haven't heard anything." Amy wriggled, blinking innocently. "We can get a hot chocolate later, can't we?" 

"That's my girl." 

The morning show cut back to the studio, the anchors volleying a few comments and speculations to fill the time, as was customary in the longer time slots. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 15|
--------------------------------------------
"Our next story might not seem quite so dramatic, but we've been told it's a big deal," John spoke out of the big flat screen as Chris' heart began to race. 

"That's right folks, get your tinfoil hats ready for this one," Penny effervesced obnoxiously. "Amateur astronomers across half the globe have reported a bright flash of light on the Moon. Some are even saying it was visible with the naked eye during the middle of the day!" 

"It happened last night at around ten sixteen pm here on the East Coast, but most of the country wasn't aligned to observe the incredible event." 

"I guess they're not just lucky with the weather in Hawaii, Jim," the blonde joked. "They're calling it the most significant lunar observation in modern history, and the conspiracies are already flying." 

"It certainly didn't help that North Korea claimed it was a test of their latest missile, but China, Russia, and our own government were quick to point out that they were decades away from any such capability. The theory gathering the most momentum is that the light was from the impact of a large meteorite. Our research team tells us that the Moon is regularly hit by such meteorites because it doesn't have a protective atmosphere. These space rocks travel at speeds of forty thousand miles per hour and faster, creating brilliant explosions when they hit." 

"No wonder it looks like swiss cheese!" 

"Oh, Penny," Jim chuckled, shaking his head. "NASA has been tight-lipped so far, but we're about to go our sister channel's coverage of a press conference getting underway at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland." 

Hailey squeaked from the couch, pulling the blanket up to hide her head. 

On screen, a lean, greying man approached a podium proudly displaying NASA's heraldry. Cameras began clicking rapidly, flashing at the man who by his posture alone, wasn't happy about his role in this. He clutched a paper coffee cup in one hand, and his brown suit jacket was slung carelessly over his other shoulder. His tie was loosened, and he squinted resentfully out at the bright lights shining on him from above the small sea of expectant reporters. The darkness under his eyes and carefree dishevelment suggested hadn't gotten any sleep the previous night. 

"Let me be clear," he started firmly, adjusting the microphone to the correct distance as the room quieted. "I am not here to speculate or fuel conjecture. If I can't answer your questions or you don't like my answers, that's too bad. It hasn't even been twelve hours since the event, and we are still gathering the data, let alone assessing it." 

He paused, leaning away to take an unmistakably satisfying gulp of hot caffeine. The reporters looked on with bated breath. 

"Very well. At twenty-two seventeen local time, a high-intensity energy burst was recorded from the surface of the Moon. Multiple observatories, as well as enthusiasts armed with sophisticated equipment, have sent us their observations, and we're once again humbled by the cooperation of the global space science community. We're confident, the event originated very near or inside Sosigenes crater, a relatively unremarkable formation near the north-western edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis. We're still analysing, but the initial consensus is that this event is inconsistent with a typical meteorite impact." 

He held up a warning finger as several hands shot into the air and a few cameras started flashing again. 

"I'll answer what I can at the end," he sighed, looking down at his meagre array of talking points. "Corresponding to the event, we experienced interference in several of our orbital solar monitoring assets. More specifically, our venerable RHESSI satellite reported an intense influx of photons in the X and Gamma spectra. Unfortunately, INTEGRAL, wasn't in position to confirm these readings. However, both Van Allen Probes are starting to report small, I repeat small, perturbations in the outer radiation belt. I don't have any more detail than that at this time." 

"Deputy Director!" One reporter stood, desperate to be the first to voice a polarising headline. "Will you reply to the statement by retired cosmonaut Andrei Khariton, that the recorded light spectra were consistent with that of a thermonuclear detonation and that if this were the case, the yield of the device would have been well over one hundred megatons. Director, that's more than twice the size of the largest bomb test carried out by the former USSR at the height of the Cold War!" 

"It's in the ballpark," the man admitted reluctantly. "But I'll repeat it, we don't know what happened so until we gather some more data, it's all just useless speculation." 

Chris winced, the man didn't seem to realise that was like dipping a bloodied toe into piranha-infested waters in the middle of the dry season. He was about to get eaten alive. Worse, the world's militaries were probably on high alert, dicks in hand for a good swinging contest. The situation was unlikely to fade quietly without him weighing in. Best to fess, that was one of Jethry's lessons. 

"I think I'd better go own up before someone gets twitchy with the nuclear football. Damn, the Synod is going to be pissed, too." 

"Was it really necessary, honey?" Susan tutted. 

"Well, no," he answered truthfully. "But it was probably worth it." 

"He's got to flex his..." Annabel glanced meaningfully at Amy. The girl seemed to have shrunk inward an attempt to remain inconspicuous. "He needs to flex the new 'muscles' we all found out about recently. It might be even more important after what we learned yesterday." 

That drew a speculative look from the dragonesses, they were not as averse to conflict as Susan tended to be. 

"I can't believe I thought it was a good idea," Hailey peeked from behind the blanket as the NASA representative shot something back at another reporter. "We're in so much trouble. There's a treaty about..." 

"Nonsense. And it still is a good idea," Chris reassured everyone in the room, meeting their eyes one by one. "Even better that we tried it on the Moon first time around. Go grab a shower and get freshened up, you're going to have to be the brains to my brawn when we talk to the President." 

"Me?" she meeped. 

He shuffled to the base of the couch on his knees and pulled her into his arms. Her hair was soft against his lips as he whispered to her. 

"You are brilliant, Hailey. I might have done the heavy lifting, but you did the heavy thinking. As far as I'm concerned, we're equals in what we accomplished yesterday. Okay?" 

She shook her head against him. 

"Absolutely," he chuckled, setting her on her feet and starting her toward the main bathroom with a playful swat. "I was probably supposed to be helping your dad today. I think he'll understand if I'm off shoving your foot in the door at your dream job." 

"I'll start breakfast, but don't push too hard with her," Annabel advised, rising with an affectionate ruffle of his messy hair as Hailey took a final terrified glance at the devolving press conference and disappeared into the bathroom. "You should get a shower too, babe. And say hi to our little blue friend while you're at it, she was probably the most worried out of all of us." 

"I will, I will." He assured, unable to help his morbid fascination at the spectacle still playing out on screen. She had a point though, Immi couldn't come out while Amy was around, that would be driving her crazy. With a grunt of protest at his complaining muscles, he clambered to his feet and left it to the ladies to tell him how the trainwreck ended. 

Back on screen, the Deputy Director was starting to get buried under increasingly outlandish questions. 

"No, I don't think it was an alien species!" he snorted in disgust. "Why would anything capable of travelling between stars bother with such a thing. Don't be ridiculous." 

"How are you going to prevent something like this happening in the future?" asked some other journalist. 

"Prevent?!" He shot a disgruntled look at someone off-screen. "Mason, where are you finding these heathens? Don't we bother vetting anymore?" 

"Budget cuts, Sir, it's not the sixties," Mason's disembodied voice only barely got picked up by the microphone, but his delivery was flawlessly dry. 

The deputy director snorted, then began laughing almost maniacally. He was wiping tears from the corners of his tired eyes, and the reporters just gobbled it up. Eventually, he sobered enough to address them again. 

"Look. People. This is space we're talking about, there is no preventing. All we can do is retask the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter for a series of flyovers in the coming months and do our best to capture some pictures. If that's not enough for you, write to Congress." 

Claire picked up the remote and flicked the power off. A silence followed as everyone just sat, listening to Annabel humming to herself in the kitchen. 

"So, munchkin," she paused, drumming out a nervous tattoo on the thighs. "How about that hot chocolate, huh?" 

"Did he blow up the Moon?!" Amy's little mouth hung open for a moment before she clapped both hands over it. Only a mortified squeak escaped, her eyes wide and apparently appalled by her tongue's betrayal. 

"He only blew it up a little bit, dear," Susan reached over the couch to put her hand on her shoulder. "The Moon will be just fine." 

"And it was for a good cause," Petra assured.

Previously on Endangered

Chris and the team return from Brazil, and Radek's demonic origins are finally exposed. The brood resolves some internal tensions whilst Reyla councils the young dragon, steeling him for the looming conflict. In Argentina, Radek is confronted by Synod hunters and barely manages to escape with his life after a bloody fight. Michelle rushes to the scene in an attempt to cover up the blatant use of magic, but has to leave without Chris, who is nowhere to be found. Petra and Claire eventually locate the missing dragon, who is off gallivanting around on the Moon with Hailey, causing trouble of their own.</i>

***

Michelle watched the bedraggled refugees whispering together in small groups out on the dusty industrial floor. The huge space was part of an abandoned fertiliser factory just beyond the outskirts of the small city nearest the disastrous spectacle of Radek's ambush. Traces of the acidic-phosphate chemical still lingered on the vast concrete floor, on the corrugated-sheet-metal walls. Despite this inconvenience, it had seemed the perfect place to sequester the traumatised witnesses while the Argentinian government scrambled to make arrangements for their care.

Thinking of these people as refugees seemed distasteful, but they fit the description well enough. Fleeing the indiscriminate use of magic, they even had that defeated look in their tired eyes. Others bore the signs of physical trauma, dried blood still caked on their rumpled, sweat-stained clothing. They were all dirty, scratched, haggard, and traumatised at the very least. Michelle's team had to treat six for shock symptoms.

Her own eyes felt swollen and full of sand, their lids taking any moment of inattention as an invitation to flutter inexorably downward.

"You can go get some rest now, you know," Lillian said incorporeally beside her. "I don't think there will be any more escape attempts."

"No," Michelle stood straighter, using the back of her hands to rub some life back into her face. "No thanks, we're almost out of here."

"How did we do?"

"Good, I think. Our fake was received about as well as could be expected, but it's definitely not over yet. The story has only been out for a few hours. Just one of these people could blow it all sky-high."

"Not so long ago, we would've just killed them all. The memory charm might seem barbaric, but it's saved a lot of human lives over the centuries." The vampire surveyed the small crowd, fifty-seven souls who would be spending the next part of their lives in captivity.

"I know what you mean, but that's exactly why things have to change," Michelle said resolutely.

They both turned as Reyla approached, accompanied and announced by the sound of Pamela's crutches.

"Well, look what wonders a visit from the Defence Minister and a little food can do," the elf remarked sourly down toward the refugees. "For a while there I was worried we were going to have to make a few examples of the savages."

"Never should have kept them in one place like that, not after what they've been through," the lean, freckled markswoman remarked. "It was only natural they mounted an organised escape."

"You're right, Pamela. But it's over now, and we'll try not to make the same mistake again," Michelle sighed. "I'm just glad no one got killed. I honestly thought we had them convinced. We were reasonable, we explained. Didn't we? "

"There's only so much trust in the human heart," Pamela murmured like some crippled sage. "When people like you and I show up in the wake of a crisis, foreigners, especially Americans, they assume they're going to be killed or sent to a bottomless hole somewhere. Add the supernatural, and the myriad crises of faith it drags along with it..."

"Scared people, fighting for their lives," Michelle nodded.

"Well, they weren't wrong, were they?" Lillian looked down on the bedraggled souls. "They're going to a bottomless hole somewhere."

A rumble outside announced the approaching buses. Soon the witnesses of Radek's hard-fought escape would be rolling off to a decommissioned barracks complex several hundred miles away. They were to be housed there, out of contact with their families or the outside world until the Revelation was announced. Representatives of both the Argentine government and the Synod were arranging for their welfare and monitoring. Provided they didn't cause trouble, the refugees were to be compensated handsomely upon their release and returned to their lives.

Michelle's sympathy for them had peaked, troughed abruptly, and now leveled out. They were in a terrible situation, through no fault of their own. Stemari and the Balgruuf hadn't helped, roughly mustering them up like errant cattle in the aftermath of dispatching the mythical bunyip. She should have seen it coming, should have planned, but she hadn't.

No wonder then that they'd tried to make a break for freedom at two a.m. that morning. Michelle understood now that they'd had no reason to trust her assurances. Even without the blatant and terrifying use of magic they'd witnessed, she and her team must seem the stereotypical intelligence agency bad guys. The exact character they'd seen depicted in so many movies.

But they'd so very nearly gotten away and blown her cobbled-together plan out of the water that she no longer saw them just as victims.

The young mother, Claudia, was limping down there. Her eye socket was just starting to properly darken up. She and her son picked through the remains of breakfast laid out on the improvised pallet-table, perhaps looking for a morsel or two to take with them on the road.

The memory of running those two down was still vivid and frightening. The pain of her injuries, throbbing and fresh.

Michelle's heart began to thump louder as she recalled that headlong chase through the dark field of soybeans and down into a dry, stony waterway. The woman rounding on her in the light of the Moon, fighting tooth and nail, like her offspring's life depended on it. Michelle had been caught off guard, and eventually forced to lay her out. Then she'd raced after the boy and spent ten agonizing minutes trying to find him in the dark before the huge wolf showed up and sniffed out his hiding place.

Nearby words drew her exhausted mind sharply to the present.

"Stemari's furious," Reyla said seriously, flicking silvery hair behind a dark ear. She'd dropped her disguise for the healing she'd grudgingly stayed up all night to work. It had actually seemed to calm some of the distraught humans to see some evidence of their claims about Beings and magic. "Magdalen's taking her off the chase, and there's going to be a full inquiry."

"Well, there goes our best chance of catching Radek." Lillian's disgust was evident. "Those two working together are something to behold, and Balgruuf has the demon's scent now. I've never heard of anything more idiotic."

"Lord Guthrie argued against it, but last night, they voted to back off on Radek until after the Revelation," Reyla explained. "I just got the minutes through on Maginet. They think it's too dangerous to confront him openly again."

"Maybe it is," Pamela mused. "But after what I saw in that church, I'm thinking it's too dangerous not to. You don't win this sort of engagement by sitting idly by and hoping things work out in your favour."

"Well said," Reyla eyed the human speculatively. "Come work for me if Michelle doesn't treat you right."

The warehouse's big corrugated iron door banged and began rolling open. Uniformed soldiers were already assembling outside, armed but reasonably relaxed. A couple of army medics strode in and began triage, helping the most battered refugees out to the waiting transports. There were a few who were put on stretchers, Balgruuf and Stemari had recaptured most of them, and weren't gentle about it.

"Huh, you can't have her. Ouch!" Michelle winced; her right thigh screaming where Claudia had managed to connect with a large rock in the midst of their nighttime scuffle. "Jesus that hurts. Let's start packing up."

"We depart already?" Reyla seemed confused, a slight frown on her dark brow. "Who will keep this rabble in line? Who will clean up that mess out on the highway?"

"Reyla, we need to get back to the States and start selling the shit out of our cover story," Michelle explained tiredly. "The locals assure me they've got it under control now. Despite the Synod running scared, Balgruuf and Stemari will stay around for a few days and help one of their higher-ups investigate. They don't need us any more. Besides, Chris, the adorable oaf, has managed to light another fire under our asses while we were busy."

***

"Daddy, I'm terrified," Hailey buried her face against her father's plaid work-shirt, hugging him desperately.

"Shh, pumpkin. How many times have you told me you wanted to work for NASA one day?" Stephen chuckled deeply, squeezing his daughter right back. He ruffled her fine blonde hair, winking at Chris over her diminutive height. "Think of this as an interview opportunity. Go over there and wow them. You wouldn't want Chris to go face them alone, would you?"

"No," she admitted, looking back at her boyfriend. He seemed too untroubled by this though. They were supposedly going to see the President, and he'd hardly even bothered getting dressed up! If anything, the dark hoodie he had over his crisp shirt at the moment made him seem more casual than usual.

"You'll be fine, sweety," her mother came to her side and hugged her briefly. "I've got to go to work. Make me proud, okay?"

Hailey wasn't sure this was the reaction she'd wanted from her parents. Maybe she'd been hoping they would forbid her from going with Chris, save her somehow. They seemed to have suddenly decided she was an adult and should be taking full responsibility for herself. Of course, they had to do it in the most maddeningly supportive way possible. 

"What are you scared of?" Stephen teased his daughter goodnaturedly. "Look at the size of him, no one's going to mess with you or anything. You wouldn't let anything happen to my baby girl, would you Chris?"

"Ahh, no. Absolutely not, Stephen." Chris stood straighter, ignoring the nagging voice in his head that pointed out the several times they'd almost come to a messy end on their trip to the Moon. "You'll be fine, Hailey. I guarantee the science types are going to adore you. I'll be the one they're calling a reckless idiot, and I can make sure it stays that way if I have to. We really need to leave though, I don't know how long it takes me to get to DC."

"Go on, Hailey," her father rumbled.

"But, Daaaad."

"Ah ah ah. Young lady, you lost the right to play that card when you got a dragon for a boyfriend and told me you were moving out. What do you expect me to do, huh?"

"I don't know," she shrugged pathetically. Her heart was pounding. She might have put a few cracks in her shell to pursue Chris, but inside, she was still a timid person. The very thought of being confronted by the world's space experts, the president. She shuddered. Humans who no doubt thought she was a freak of nature and...

"Alright, I'll go instead," Stephen sighed heavily.

"What?" she scowled up at her father.

"Chris, take me up to the Capitol so I can explain how you two did this fusi-what-chu-ma-call-it."

"Dad!"

"Absolutely," Chris laughed. "But Stephen, I've got to point out, it was actually an advanced fusi-thingy-ma-jiggy. Big difference."

"Really?" The werebison nodded thoughtfully, scratching his chin. "Well, I'm clearly not going to be much use. If only there was..."

"Alright!" Hailey punched her father's broad chest and spun away from him. "You're both fucking insufferable dorks, I swear to God."

"Love you too, pumpkin," Stephen called after his daughter as she stormed through the door into their backyard.

"Nice one," Chris grinned. "Sorry I'm ditching you and the terrible trio today. I'll be there as much as I can for the next few weeks."

"You're fine, Chris, we're getting close now. Take care of her for me."

Stephen couldn't help feeling that this was some sort of pivotal moment. His heart began fluttering as watched his daughter with the young dragon he'd grown to call a friend. Hailey looked so beautiful, so grown up. Bundled against the turning weather in her blue long-coat, a grey sweater-dress, two pairs of black nylons, and her calf-high boots, he realised she wasn't just his little girl anymore.

The dragon took a knee on the concrete path. Stephen watched the young man take her hand, listened to his calm words of reassurance and encouragement. Hailey could be a willful little thing when she didn't want to do something though, and she had always been terribly skittish about strangers. She turned her face away from him, curling inward.

He knew for sure then, by the tenderness, the reverence with which Chris put his thumb against her chin and gently forced her to face the world, that this was the right man for his precious, scary-smart daughter.

***

Dark, frigid water frothed and churned beneath, savage forces of wind and water fighting a pitched battle that left both enraged. Enormous arctic waves loomed in the darkness, buffeted by the same freezing squalls that threatened to bat her out of the sky like some errant insect. She hadn't done flying like this for centuries, millennia. It felt good to truly test herself once more, to fly like her life depended on it. It had been so long, trapped in that lifeless routine of base survival.

Nyx thought of the dragon, counting on his fingers like a child as he tried to explain the year in that ugly new tongue they used. She knew now that it was the twenty-first century after the death of some bearded, sandal-wearing, martyr. If memory served, that's how many fingers he'd counted off on those enormous hands of his, too. That made this her thirty-ninth century and her twenty-eighth in survival-imposed exile.

It took only a few days to abandon her island prison, saying her goodbyes to the few merfolk she sometimes traded with for fish. Flying east across the sea, she'd tolerated a brief delay to gather information in her old homeland. The state of dilapidation was too depressing to bear for long.

Nyx wept for a day, perched amongst the dry vegetation on a low slope overlooking the site of ancient Elis. Once, she'd captained the night garrison there. It had changed rulers, and she'd moved on long before her exile, of course. To see it wiped off the face of the earth though? For some reason, she'd assumed time would not have been so cruel to her family's ancient home. Dusty memory was all that remained now.

That night, she scented out and ambushed a young satyr as he walked a dark path down out of the dry hills. The lights and noise of an unknown town drew him, presumably, for a night of frolic. It was comforting that at least that hadn't changed. All evening she'd seen scantily clad young men and women entering strange temples adorned with flashing lights and absurd, thumping music. It seemed a good playground for a lusty satyr.

He'd screamed girlishly and tried to flee when she swooped out of the darkness. Bleating cries to the Old Gods went unanswered, unable to save him from the winged apparition.

A light sweep of her dory and a pounce later, she sat on his chest as he sprawled in the dust. The interrogation lasted nearly until dawn, growling questions down at the wide-eyed youngster under threat of claw and blade. She'd learned much once they began to understand more of each other's speech. He would surely have a story to tell his family up in the hills.

Most treasured of her new knowledge were a few more words of the confounding language the dragon had spoken. The satyr also had an ingenious tablet-map device that somehow seemed to contain the entire world. It was incredible, so bright, holding so much knowledge. She'd stolen it, of course, and soon realised that her journey must take her east, into the fabled orient. Too much ocean lay between her destination to west.

That was indeed a powerful magic, though a short-lived one. The spell had stopped working after a day and a night, the once bright surface dark and unresponsive to her impatient touch. The dragon's minions had carried such devices, so he could no doubt teach her the secret of it. Finally, after a few hopeful taps against her shield and a probing of her magic, she'd dropped the frustrating thing into the Aegean. The rough location of the strange city called Denver was already memorised, as well as a few landmarks that would tell her when to turn inland once she reached the distant continent. She flew on, ever eastward.

The lack of a notable Being presence disturbed her deeply. None of her kind challenged her slinking passage through their territory by night. No call of alarm was raised as a winged embodiment of war swished low over the sleeping lands. She only ever caught a whiff of vampire in the larger cities as she settled in to watch and rest for the day. That was hardly surprising, given their proclivities, but the great magical races were nowhere to be seen. Magic was dying.

Not so the humans. When she'd finally made it over the sky-conquering mountains and into the heart of the Orient, she couldn't believe the sheer number of scuttling little people below. Their cities lit the sky for miles around, belching out clouds of foul-smelling, acrid haze.

When she was small, a plague of locusts had beset the crops of the village in the valley below the cliff where her family roosted. It had been a wet spring, and the hopping, ravenous creatures swarmed out of the ground to gorge themselves on the green wheat stalks that thrived out on the river delta. She couldn't help drawing a comparison to the humans who now seemed to crawl over every piece of even slightly hospitable land.

Even their roads were enormous, like pulsing arteries, and full of those confounding powered carts. What was wrong with a horse, or a good pair of sandals? Cars, yes, that's what Chris had called them.

She growled at the very thought of him. Clutched tight against her chest, her aspis creaked in protest. The bronze and wood of the rounded shield crying their innocence as she vented her anger in a harsh squeeze. Oh, how she wanted to thrash that adorable whelp. Treacherous muscles deep in her tummy began to quiver excitedly at the prospect, and what would surely follow. How dare he leave her behind? Didn't he know the courage it had taken to come out of that tree, to approach a stranger after all those years? And that smirking vampire, she would be lucky if she didn't get the blade of her spear through that smug, harlot's smile!

Nyx held tight to that anger because it helped keep the terrible, slithering doubt at bay. She had only been curious to begin with, fascinated by the trespassers because she so rarely encountered magical kind on that island. Like a moth, she'd been drawn closer and closer, tantalised by delicious trickles of leaked magic and the faint scent of cinnamon on the wind. Was it possible that he didn't wish to mate? In their halting attempts at conversation, he'd seemed gentle, even receptive. But he'd abandoned her, vanishing through the Ether in a godlike display of power. 

Freezing, salty mist splashed through the eye slits of her plumed helmet, startling her wandering focus to the present. The gargoyle cursed, flapping her mighty wings valiantly as a colossal swell rose up out of the night to swallow her. As she'd been pining pathetically, the wind had driven her far too close to the water. Nyx screamed wordlessly at the storm, the sea, and her impetuous decision to fly the straight that night. She fought the air for her very life now.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
Wind-whipped foam and icy water glanced off the surface of her shield, bucking violently into her. She barely cleared the top of that monster wave, her lower body splashing against it as her wings battled for purchase.

Gasping at the chill of arctic seawater across her front, Nyx dove downwind into the valley of the trough, regaining what airspeed she could in a desperate attempt to stay out of the water's deadly grasp. Perhaps most insulting was the stinging of bitter salt in her tail-eye. Blinking sourly, she tightened her grey tail around the haft of her dory, bracing it up between her wings, so the spear-tip jutted above her head. She must look quite comical she thought, some archaic warrior attempting to joust the storm.

Flying with her armour and weapons was burdensome to say the least. To do so in such weather could yet be the end of her. And for what? A pup of barely two decades who somehow reeked of ancient power.

Low she skimmed along the trench between the huge waves, dodging the crest of a several-ton chunk of ice that tumbled sluggishly down the slope of the swell. Instinctively mimicking the greatest of seabirds, she let the wind push her along. Skimming just above the surface allowed her to take advantage of the ground effect and the extra push of air trapped beneath her wings.

At the first slackening of the howling gale, she angled upward and flapped for dear life. The dense, salty air fought her for every inch of altitude, but she'd stolen its speed and now cashed in for the height she needed to get back on course.

To be downed in that thrashing, glacial water would mean almost certain death. When dawn came, and she turned to stone, she would sink like one. Her formidable strength and resilience wouldn't save her from the crush of depth when night returned. If she sank deep enough, out of the sun's reach, she would slowly dwindle and starve on the muddy, dark seafloor. The sun must be only a few hours away now, too. Putting that depressing thought out of her mind, she instead turned to berating her carelessness.

Thanks to that spell of mooning, when she reached the continent across the straight, she would somehow have to clean and oil every inch of her gear. Corrosive salt could not be tolerated. The beautiful, mithril chain of her long-shirt would be the worst, for she didn't have a convenient bath of oil to dunk it in. Her molded cuirass, greaves, plumed helmet, gauntlets and reinforced leather skirt would all require time with a cloth, but nothing compared to the arduous task of cleaning chain if rust set in. Still, the lightweight armour allowed her to fly into battle, and that mobility had proved the bane of her enemies before. Leaving it all behind hadn't even been considered. It was all she really had of her previous life, and they were the tools of her trade.

Finally, after fighting the storm for every foot of progress for what felt like hours, a faint light grew in the gloom. Nyx dared not hope too much, it could be a lost fishing boat or some warning beacon indicating the presence of treacherous rocks. With soaring relief, she swooped low across pounding surf and over a bleak scattering of snow-covered huts.

She left the sad little village behind without further thought. Turning southward, she streaked over the windswept tundra coast, hunting for a place to roost. A blubbery animal would also be a welcome find, she could certainly use the sustenance, and the fat might protect her equipment in a bind.

Ever onward she would fly, resting by day, until she found the great city of Denver where her unsuspecting dragon waited. There would be a reckoning, and Aphrodite willing, she would find new reasons to live. Her aeon in hiding was over.

***

"You're lucky you can make these orbs absorb radio waves," Hailey looked down through the invisible floor of their magical transportation at the grey and green of the city below. "This has to be some of the tightest airspace in the country. It's incredible to think this is even possible, we crossed half the country in less than two hours. You're really going to have to start taking care about flight paths. Some people will notice the mysterious sonic boom too and... Chris?"

"I'm concentrating," he murmured, his sharp eyes barely making out the detail of a particularly green little rectangle next to a large building far below them. "Ready? Here we go."

In the instant he dropped the transparent orb sheltering them from the bitter, cold air ten thousand feet above the White House, Chris slipped them into the Ether. Before they fell more than half a foot, he jumped onto the otherworldly lawn of the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden.

That grey landscape of shadowy outlines was not its usually empty self.

Chris lunged aside, pulling Hailey with him as something wooshed inches overhead with an angry squawk. Off balance, he stumbled forward, brushing against the ghostly presence of a tall hedgerow that bordered the garden.

"Aaargg!" he bellowed in agony as the shadow somehow lacerated deep gashes down the left side of his body. Chris tumbled backward on to the sickly-looking lawn, clutching at his wounds even as his eyes caught a glimpse of movement. In the hedge, something dark wriggled in ecstasy, retracting its bloodied, glass-like blades deeper into the shrubbery.

Hailey screamed, shrill and high as he groaned in pain. She fixated on the crimson weeping from four deep razor-like slices. It was a nightmare, his purple aura pulsing bright in his leaking blood.

Wide-eyed at the sight of so much of his own life-stuff, Chris got a hold of himself and sat up. Gingerly his left arm rotated so he could inspect the clean, steadily flowing cut just above his elbow. It throbbed, and he could feel three more shouting to make their presence known. On his calf, his thigh, and thankfully across one of his ribs. It hadn't slipped between, so far as he could tell.

"Jesus that hurts, what the fuc..."

Something chittered excitedly above them and began a trilling alarm cry. They both looked up to a brown, leathery creature clinging to the ghostly facade of the President's residence. It looked like a flying mouth.

The little monstrosity was completely naked. Wrinkled, fetid skin stretched taut across sinew and bone and bat-like wings. It didn't have a head, per se. Its thrashing tail led to a footlong torso dominated by bulging flight muscles. That beige body just ended in a salivating maw and four yellow, elongated teeth that gnashed with pincer-like, independent twitches. There were no eyes, no snout, no ears, just a ravenous mouth ready to gnaw their bones. Still, it was somehow pointed right at them.

Chris forgot about his wounds as the hideous thing flapped its tattered wings, attached to the vertical shadow-wall by the wicked hooks at the end of four stumpy, skeletal legs. It bounced itself in a frenzy, all the while making its terrible, screeching racket. It almost reminded him of the rooster back on Jethry's farm, clucking and fussing to draw the hens in when he'd found a particularly tasty morsel to share in the course of his scratching.

That comparison proved far too apt, as they heard the cry taken up by hundreds of discordant, eager voices in the dark branches of the surrounding trees.

"Chris lets get out of here!" Hailey cried, tugging at his good arm, trying to pull him up off the diseased grass.

The shrieking stopped.

They both froze instinctively. It was only because Chris was in the process of clawing his way to his feet, that he saw the black, squiggling parasite worming its way up the side of Hailey's calfskin boot.

Branches rustled, and the flapping of hundreds of unseen wings taking to the dark air suddenly whispered in their ears. Chris flicked the thing off of Hailey as he tottered upright in growing panic. Adrenaline rushed into his arteries as he saw the first of the creatures winging in toward them from every direction. He stared in shock, leaking his precious blood into a pool of joyously thrashing black leeches that lurked in the grass.

Hailey whimpered in abject fear, breaking from his side to dash toward the building. That snapped him out of his disbelieving stupor. Splitting up was about the worst thing they could do.

"Hailey, no!" He dove after her with an outstretched hand, ignoring the pain lancing up his side. Catching just the tail of her coat, they tumbled back onto the parasite-ridden grass. She was sobbing in terror now, but he managed to pull her to his chest and turn to keep an eye on the flock.

The creatures were upon them. The flying vanguard was much faster and stealthier than Chris would have thought possible. The first few sets of outstretched, motile fangs were less than a second from his throat. He did the only thing he could think of, dumping them unceremoniously back into the Norm.

They lay gasping, blinking up in into the cold, spitting rain, catching their heaving breath.

"Get up," Chris ordered after a few seconds, struggling to his knees as he began searching for any trace of parasitic hitchhikers. "Get up and strip."

"Chris, what was that?!" Hailey held her hands over her eyes as she tried to stop crying.

"I have no idea," he groaned, his voice sounding deadened and shocked even to himself. Already he'd pulled his hoodie over his head, and was unbuttoning the blood-soaked shirt beneath. His eyes darted suspiciously across the now perfectly manicured lawn, searching for squirming movement.

In the back of his mind, he wondered what was going on in the Ether right now. It didn't bear thinking about, their shadows were no doubt being torn at by a thousand furious, shrieking mouths.

"Hailey, get up. There were some sort of leeches in the grass. Go get on the path."

"Leeches?!" Hailey shot up like a startled rabbit, scurrying off the lawn like it was a pool of lava. "I'm out, I'm fucking out!"

"Not near that hedge!" he shouted the warning, pulling her up short until he could make his way to her side. "Stop running away like that, there's something in there."

"Sorry," Hailey sniffled, taking his offered hand. Through the branches of a tree that must have housed dozens of those flying... things, she looked up at the tall, curved face of that iconic building. "I'm freaking out. We're going to be in even more trouble now."

"We'll be fine, I think. Did I tell you about the time I got an anti-nuke missile fired at me? Got a job out of that little stunt."

"You're not helping."

They cautiously made their way to the closest path, and Chris started checking the rest of his clothes for determined parasites. He ended up removing his shoes and pants, paranoid that the squiggly things had crawled into delicate places.

"Oh my god, look at this thing, it's disgusting." Sure enough, just below the hem of his boxer shorts, one of the worm-like things was latched to the back of his thigh. It was tough, rubbery and strong when he prodded it, rather than squishy. Very carefully, he pulled at the end which wasn't busy sucking his blood. It writhed mightily, sucking and injecting something that burned, jolting him into giving up. "Ouch! The fucker."

"I'm going to be sick if there's one on me," Hailey's voice rose as she watched him try again. "Chris, tell me there isn't one on me!"

"There probably is," he said honestly. "I should be able to burn it off, but this isn't exactly the most discreet place to start a magical fire."

Giving up on Ether-leech for the moment, Chris inspected the wounds on his left side in the overcast light. The cold and wet didn't bother him one bit after what they'd just escaped. Never had he imagined the Ether could be so openly hostile. He'd heard it could be dangerous, sure. Wraiths, ghouls, people getting trapped in there and dying from the magical drain. That sort of thing. This just seemed so... insidious.

"You're still bleeding pretty badly." Hailey poked gently around the wound on his rib. The slowly flowing streams of clotting, darkening red mixed with the light rain to spread wetly down the muscles of his tummy. "What did it?"

"I don..."

"Don't move!" The voice spoke with the authority of a long career spent in law enforcement.

Chris sighed. He'd really hoped to sneak in and find the President in the Ether, thereby avoiding this exact situation.

"Hands above your head. Slowly."

Hailey let out a little squeak and jumped close against his chest, her body trembling once again as footsteps approached from behind him. He could hear more of them now that he was listening, thundering across the lawns from several directions.

"It's alright," Chris spoke calmly, looking directly into Hailey's scared blue eyes, trying to impress that she benefit from his words as well. He began slowly raising his hands, but couldn't get the left one up all the way. "We're here to see the President. My name's Christopher Baryst, we're expected."

A fit, middle-aged man in a dark windbreaker came into his peripheral vision, pistol trained low but directly at them.

"Hands up, miss."

"It's okay, Hailey, do as he says," Chris soothed as she tentatively raised her arms. He was thankful that the secret service agent seemed experienced enough to recognise Hailey's fright and quit with the shouting. "We're going to be just fine."

A younger fellow came running up the path behind Hailey.

"Nice one, Rogers. Where the hell did they come from?" he panted, holstering his weapon and quickly moving in close to grab Hailey's wrists.

"Don't touch her." It came out of his mouth almost as a hiss, promising death even though he hadn't twitched a muscle. The dragon lunged under his skin, on edge from their encounter in the Ether and ready to spring to Hailey's defence.

Both agents took a wary step back, and the man's gun was back in his hand in short order.

"On the ground!" ordered the newcomer.

"No."

"Do it, shithead!"

"Call President Falconer. Tell him you're trying to arrest a dragon." Chris took the calculated risk that these men, who guarded the president, after all, would probably know about Beings.

Hailey's eyes told him she wasn't going to handle anything else just now. He prayed she was smart enough to know that making a break for it now was an even worse move than before.

"I knew it," Rogers muttered, taking a further two steps back, aiming his pistol at Chris' head this time. "Paul, get a hold of the President somehow would you?"

"You're not serious?"

"Look at him, man. He showed up out of thin air. Radio the guys on personal detail, ask if he's expecting a Christopher Baryst."

"Thanks for that, Rogers," said Chris. He gave the agent a cheeky grin as his colleague grudgingly tapped a few messages into his phone. "Do you think I could relax a little? There's a leech on the back of my thigh, and I don't want him getting any ideas about crawling higher if you know what I mean."

"Shut it," Rogers barked, but took a half step to glance at the back of his leg, really taking in the rest of his injuries now that the initial rush was calming. "Jesus... you're all fucked up. Okay son, you two can relax a little but no sudden moves."

They waited. The freezing droplets falling from the sky thickened, pattering down on the bare skin of his shoulders. They provided sweet relief against the throbbing heat of his cuts. Terrified though Hailey was, he couldn't help notice the way the rain bounced onto her blonde hair. The fine strands resisted at first but were quickly becoming saturated. Wet-haired Hailey with frightened eyes tugged at his heartstrings. He wasn't going to let anything else bad happen to her today, not one thing.

"I don't fucking believe it," Paul muttered, turning toward the White House to the sound of a commotion.

"Stand down! Stand down!" The President himself came running down the steps from the oval office balcony, hollering as he came. To his flanks, four upset-looking, suited agents escorted him out into rain.

Robert Falconer was a lean man, with a slightly hawkish nose befitting his family's namesake. His black hair was sliding into grey with the sort of grace that had helped swing a good portion of undecided female voters his way. He was obviously in good shape, running across the wet grass in his fine navy suit, uncaring of the inclement weather or the prospect of dirtying his perfectly shined shoes. His eyes darted across Chris' bloodied side even as he and his men came to a halt in front of their little gathering. "Put those damn guns away. Chris, what happened?"

Chris lowered his arms thankfully, uncaring of his pain or state of leech-induced undress. He wrapped Hailey up in a hug against his non-bloody side.

"I... Sir," Chris looked up, not knowing how best to explain what had happened.

"Let's get inside," Robert gestured for everyone to start walking back toward the imposing white building. "It's the damn White House lawn, someone with a camera is going to be paying attention. What is it? Were you attacked?"

"Sort of, I don't know how to put this politely," Chris admitted, noticing that the agents had surrounded them as they walked and were hanging off of every word. "Your house is riddled with magical vermin."

"You're serious?" The president's groomed eyebrow fell back into position as he realised the lad wasn't joking.

"I was trying to make an inconspicuous entrance, but they very nearly got us in the Kennedy Garden, Sir. Still got some leech-thingys on me to prove it. And there's a big flock of meat-eating devil-chicken-crab-bats living in all your nice trees. Well, in the Ether anyway."

"I think they might be shrikes," Hailey spoke quietly from underneath his arm, events sweeping her along and loosening her frightened tongue. "I sort of remember the description from a scary story one of my aunts told me."

"A shrike? I thought that was a kind of bird?" the President wondered.

"It is, Sir." One of his men answered before trotting back to collect Chris' discarded clothes.

"Huh, and you must be Hailey? The young woman who's caused such a stir."

"I'm the stirrer, Sir. Hailey just taught me how to hold the spoon."

The President's eyes narrowed as they started up a set of steps. He wasn't used to anyone taking such a flippant tone with him these days, but it was sort of refreshing.

"Well alright then," Robert paused, glancing around warily before they went inside. "Not all of the NASA folks are here yet. We'll sneak you up to the family rooms and let you clean up a bit before they arrive. I can try to find you something to wear but it's not going to be easy. Do you need a doctor? Michelle told me you can heal yourself very effectively."

"I should be okay, thanks Sir." Chris looked at his arm again, the bleeding was slowing.

"This conversation you promised better be worth it, Chris. Alright, I've got to go explain to two congressmen why I ran out of our meeting like I'd been stung by a bee." The President chuckled evilly. "Rogers, you found them, take them up to the second floor and look after them. Get them whatever they want, and for God's sake, no one mention this to my wife!"

***

Annabel was wallowing in the perfect state of drowsy relaxation as she lay on the couch. Immi snoozed too, sprawled on top of her, blue cheek resting on the meager pillow of her right breast. The warmth, weight, and closeness of her friend probably wasn't helping her own state of wakefulness. She'd meant to do some reading, but the book was so heavy and her eyelids so droopy. They'd been so busy here at home or at the chef's academy last week.

Combined with yesterday's worry on two fronts, she was exhausted. Her brain refused to settle into true sleep though, chasing its own tail around in circles.

She still wasn't sure how she felt about Chris' unannounced visit to the Moon. Immi was, of course, full of ideas for 'punishments' that inevitably wound up with her tummy packed full. It was an interesting conundrum though. She'd been mad as hell when Petra and Claire had explained that he was missing. Combined with the news about Radek, she'd been terrified. But that part wasn't his fault.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
She was honestly too shocked by the extent of his powers to have processed just how she felt about the apparent recklessness of the way he used them. He went to the God-damn Moon! Her fiance was a walking, talking spaceship. If he could do that then... well, she didn't know really. What couldn't he do? Who was she to complain if it kept her broodmates and their children safe?

Was a phone call so hard though? Perhaps it was. She frowned, she would never have agreed to him taking Hailey to the Moon if he'd asked her beforehand. Then he would have been put in a position where he would be tempted to lie or go behind her back.

Annabel yawned. Damn, she was too snoozy for this.

Immi's shallow breathing and occasional twitches were just adorable. Annabel lazily ran a hand down the sprite's spine to cup her perfect, little blue rump. The only thing that could make the moment better was if Chris was there, wrapping them both in his arms. It seemed like they'd barely seen him lately, and not in their bed where he belonged.

As if summoned by Radek himself, her phone started vibrating angrily on the coffee table, shattering the peace of their mid-morning laziness. Annabel's eyes opened reluctantly, and Immi grumbled sleepy protest as she reached to see who could possibly be so rude as to disturb her. It was the weekend, damn it.

The phone's screen announced that her mother was calling, and Annabel groaned. It was so tempting to swipe the call toward the red symbol, to reject it. But it was her Mom, and she deserved a little more respect than that. Bartholomew stirred on her tummy, sensing her apprehension. Ever since her engagement, and Chris' brief elevation to the status of local hero, her mother had been pestering her.

"Hi Mom," she answered with false enthusiasm and another stifled yawn.

"Hello dear," Barbra Somerset was almost giddy with excitement to get her story out. "So. I stopped by to talk to Pastor Franklin on the way home from the grocery store this morning and he said that he would be delighted to fit your ceremony in next spring. He's already reserved two Saturdays when he thinks the cherry trees will be in bloom, won't that be wonderful?"

"Mom..."

"I know, I know. The photos will be spectacular, and the whole congregation can be there. Merryl Jefferson will have a fit when she finds out that I convinced the pastor to reserve the dates for you. He couldn't help himself when I reminded him that Christopher stopped that terrible shooting. I'm still disappointed in you for even being in a despicable club like that, young lady. His bravery helped open my eyes, though. He's a good man, even if he isn't devout. Your father has been grumbling less about it lately, too. It'll be up to you now to bring your husband into the Lord's fold, Annabel."

"Mom, I don't... aahh," she gasped, her eyes flying open as Immi latched onto her sensitive nipple through only the thin fabric of her slip. She stared daggers down at the coy sprite, who grinned defiantly back around her prize and raised her leg to rub against Annabel's crotch. If only her mother could see her now, this nightmarish wedding obsession of hers would surely vanish. She wondered if her Mom would just up and faint at the sight of the winged, blue beauty molesting her.

"Oh, don't you worry about a thing," Barbra continued obliviously. "I've already got a plan floating around in my head for the ceremony and some great ideas for the vows. I even ran into Linda from Creative Catering last week and they would be delighted to do the food for such a high-profile wedding."

"Mom!" Annabel sat bolt upright, dislodging her amorous blue limpet to tumble into her lap with an indignant yelp. That was the last straw. She'd indulged her mother's fantasy for far too long now if it had come to this. "Creative Catering?! If all I wanted at my wedding was stale club sandwiches and a selection of fried-frozen nibbles, I still wouldn't hire Creative Catering. And this isn't high profile!"

"Well, you should have told me that before I talked to Linda. I'm going to look very foolish if I have to go back and tell her we're using someone else."

"We?! Mom, this is my wedding!" Annabel's temper rose, her nostrils flaring with months of slow-simmered anger. This was so typical of her mother, hijacking and twisting something that should have been wonderful. She knew exactly why too, she must be getting all sorts of kudos amongst the congregation's wives. After Chris' time in the spotlight, she was using their engagement to peck her way up the social order. Well, she was in for a rude awakening. "In fact, I'm not getting married in Laramie. We're not even getting married in a church!"

"Lord, have mer..."

"Just shut up!"

Immi's eyes widened in shock, and Bartholomew scampered around onto the skin of her lower back, cowering from his Mistress's rage.

"You and Dad hated Chris," Annabel seethed. "You've said terrible things about him for years. Well guess what?! You don't even know him, and you haven't known me for years either. I'll be forever thankful that I met him, not only because I love him like nothing else in this world, but because he opened my eyes to your bullshit! I'm not getting married in a church, I don't even know if I want a Christian ceremony anymore."

Her mother gasped, and promptly began sobbing. It was a blatant, age-old guilt trip. Annabel took Immi's small hand in her own and continued more calmly into the phone. She was really going to say it, it had needed to be said for a long time now. She could feel the tears welling already. Catharsis held out its warm hand, beckoning her toward release.

"Mom? I didn't fall obediently into your brainwashed, prejudiced little world. You need to learn to deal with that. I want to get married somewhere warm. Maybe on Chris' farm in summer, or next to a mountain stream, or... or on a tropical beach somewhere! And it will be intimate, just close friends and family so I can do the food myself. You and Dad aren't invited right now. I know that despite the sermons and the hymns you sing every Sunday, you're mean inside. You're bigoted, xenophobic, small-minded, and nothing would please you more than if I ended up exactly like you!"

For several seconds, the only sounds coming through the phone were each other's heavy breathing. In that quiet moment, Annabel nurtured a tiny spark of hope that her Mom would somehow take her words to heart, that she might change. The Revelation was going to crack her parent's insular existence as ruthlessly as the eggs she'd used that morning for omelets. Her faint hope was that they could somehow open their eyes to the realities of the world around them before they were faced with that sundering. Hope shriveled like a cut flower at her mother's next words.

"What did I ever do to deserve such an ungrateful, wicked bitch for a daughter?! To think, I argued against your father sending you to a good Christian school when you started up with that godless boy. Well now look what he's done to you. What an idiot I was! I'll pray to God for your redempt..."

Annabel hung up, anger and sorrow making her gifted magic writhe dangerously. She didn't want to hear another word of spiteful rhetoric from her mother's mouth, lest she do something truly stupid. Bartholomew was already gnashing his little teeth that anyone would dare say such things to her.

Immi stood up and wrapped her slender arms around Annabel's neck. She snuggled close, trying to pour all the love and comfort she could into her Mistress.

"It will be okay," she whispered against the long strands of Annabel's chestnut hair. "We'll find just the right beach, it will be perfect. We'll all be there for you, Annabel."

"I know," Annabel choked, more warm tears beginning to trickle down her cheeks. "I know I needed to say that, but why can't they just be good people?"

"People are just people. Look, it could be worse," Immi consoled, squeezing her friend tighter and fluttering her wings in sympathy. "My father tried to marry me off to a horrible elf as a spell-slave. I had to hide out in the Ether for years to escape that disaster, until I found you and Master."

"Thank you, Immi. I love you."

"And I love you, Mistress."

They held each other, Annabel running her fingers through the sprite's loose, midnight blue tresses to massage her sensitive, pointed ears. Gradually, her raging turmoil calmed until all that was left was her affection and gratitude for her diminutive lover. She was so lucky to have Immi as a companion. As friends, they could share anything. It made things like this bearable when Chris was away or occupied with other members of his brood.

Annabel decided to reinforce that affection, carrying the sprite back into their bedroom for a long, languid session of lovemaking. She could play Immi like a master musician now. Producing just the desired notes of passion was easy with the skillful use of fingers, lips, tongue, and even teeth.

They were at it for hours, the almond-sweetness of Immi's addictive, creamy juices drawing her ever back to the growing sprite's blue-lipped nethers. In the end, she brought Immi to one final, screaming climax by stretching her wide with two fingers, promising it wouldn't be long until she helped guide Chris inside her.

They whiled away the rest of the morning, and much of the afternoon with their shiftless amour.

***

"I don't know about you, but this is alright." Chris admired the shower, every aspect seemed elegant. From the taps to the tiles, to the wide stream of high-pressure hot water. The whole damn bathroom they'd been snuck into reeked of affluence and history on a scale he hadn't encountered before. It almost put the plans for his own bathroom to shame, but not quite.

"I don't care about the shower! Look at that fucking leech, it's getting fat on you!" Hailey hovered behind him, grossed out and fascinated at the same time.

"Don't poke it," he tisked, running his hand through the spray to check the temperature. "Aren't you going to check yourself?"

"Are you sure this wasn't all a ploy to get me naked?"

"No," he sighed, happy that she seemed to be bouncing back okay from their run-in on the President's lawn. "I think that would be a little elaborate, don't you? Though, I will confess a healthy male curiosity."

"Humph." Apparently satisfied, Hailey began struggling to get out of her damp coat. "Um, will you help me?" 

"Help undress you? What sort of a stupid question is that?"

He took the few steps to her and gently helped pull her dress over her head. Off came her undershirt, revealing the bronzed, upper swell of those magnificent breasts, and the appealing curves of her abdomen. A close inspection revealed two leeches squirming unsuccessfully at the base of her right butt cheek. Attracted by the warmth and scent of blood, they were thwarted by her double-layered stockings. Chris quickly dealt with them.

It was finally time to singe off his own clinger. It had gorged on enough of his blood by now to almost warrant naming. Only a tiny hint of fire magic against its black skin made it drop instantly. The thing was sluggish on the bathroom tiles, too heavy to make a credible escape. He picked it up, held it over the very expensive looking sink, and incinerated it vindictively.

"Good riddance," his growl faded with the fire as he turned to Hailey. "Well, this adventure of ours keeps getting weirder and weirder."

"Yeah," she said, eyes darting furtively to the running shower and back to him.

"Do you want to? I was going... I mean I can leave, or whatever," he stumbled over his words like a smitten schoolboy.

Her lips pursed in a maddening little smile, pink and inviting as she shimmied right out of stockings and salmon-pink panties as one.

"Oh, Hailey," he breathed, eyes glued to the fully-fleeced treasure at the apex of her thighs. "I had it all wrong, beauty can outweigh even your brains."

The matching bra fell to the floor, freeing perfect, heavy breasts to sway and settle.

"Shut up," she flung herself against his chest, not caring that his skin was still cold from the rain. "I thought we weren't going to make it back there."

"I know, Mini Moo, but we're okay. I'm sorry."

He took her in his arms, kissed her soundly, and carried her under the tepid waterfall. They held each other close, warming under the flow. The stress of the bizarre attack slowly melted as they explored the soft pleasures of just holding each other, skin against skin.

Chris' boxers were soon soaked, then discarded to partially block the drain. It was their first time naked with each other, and they took tentative advantage. He ran his hands over her shoulders, down the contours of her back as she pressed herself into his chest. For a while they just hugged, feeling each other.

"I shouldn't have tried to run," she finally whispered. "I got so scared. I'm not like Lillian or Claire, I'm weak and..."

"Stop." Chris squeezed her tight, cutting off her self-flagellation. "You are not weak, Hailey. You might have faults, we all do. Confidence might even be your greatest, but we can work on that. I'm not sure what it's going to take to make you see yourself as I do, an amazing, gorgeous, incredibly intelligent young woman. I won't ever give up on making you see yourself like that."

Hailey felt so small wrapped inside his arms, so protected. His heartfelt words made her want to both melt with desire and cry at the same time. She settled for a little sniffle.

"Trust me, you're incredible, so stop comparing yourself to my mates. You do trust me, don't you?"

"Yes," she sighed, kissing gently at the skin directly over his heart.

"I will always do my best to keep you safe, even when you get scared and almost land us in more trouble," Chris chuckled now that they were past the ordeal. "I might fail terribly at times, but I'll try."

"Okay," she breathed, looking up at his handsome features. "And I'll try to be a little more confident."

They held each other in content silence a while longer, but the closeness of youthful bodies and gentle touching soon ignited more carnal desires. For Hailey, breathing his maddening scent, touching his soft skin over hard muscles, being touched back so gently, it all set her insides smouldering. His eager member was stirring too, thickening. She could feel it, dragging warmth up the sensitive skin of her inner thigh. Their eyes met, and he gave her the most unapologetic, goofy grin she'd seen yet, rolling his eyes.

"He can't help himself it seems," he murmured wryly. 

Boldly, she pressed into the base of it, leaning close to look up at him. Her soft thatch of fine, golden pubic hair pressed against his thigh, nipples flattening delightfully against the firmness of his almost-edible musculature. She stepped away to give his insistent penis space to rise, lest it attempt to lift her off the ground. Hailey's breath hitched as it nudged against her plump, engorging labia on its way to stand tall and proud between them.

"Well, he's not getting lucky today," she looked down between them, her hand tentatively brushing the side of his shaft. It was daunting, and yet exhilarating to think about him slipping inside her. Even his balls seemed enormous, bulging below and to either side of his thick root. When she worked up the courage to gently cup one, the heavy orb defied her little palm. Warm, soft sack spilled onto her wrist as she looked up to his handsome blue eyes. "Jesus Chris, I knew Lillian was teasing me, but I didn't really think it would get like this. I brought a nice large toy to practice with but..."

"How many times do I have to tell people not to take Lillian to heart?" he sighed. "Hailey, you must have heard about the enchantment I used on Susan?"

"Um-hum," she nodded, nibbling her pink lower lip.

"Well, there's no rush for us to do anything. I'm enjoying just being close with you."

Her silky, wet pubic hair was tickling his skin maddeningly. Magnificent wet breasts pressed against his torso. The little minx began moving her hips side to side, creating the delightful promise of friction trapped between their bellies. He leaned down to kiss the top of her head.

"I know," she rose on her tiptoes, clinging to his solid forearms in the steam. They kissed again, slowly, tenderly, both of them trying to express the depth of their growing feelings for each other. As they parted, she surprised herself by levering his throbbing member down between her thighs to nudge at her tepid folds. "Mhh, this is good. I just wanted us to try it naturally, the first time anyway. I thought if I were used to something large, it would be nice for both of us."

Chris shook his head in disbelief, scattering droplets around the spacious stall.

"I appreciate the consideration," he said gently, trying his best not to thrust against her inviting little pussy. "We'll do it however you want, I trust you to be practical about this. The most important thing to me is that you enjoy it when we have sex."

Hailey smiled happily, pecking his collarbone before looking down between her breasts again at his excited monster. It truly was a thing of beauty. She was fascinated by the outlines of bulging veins she could see beneath the outer wrapping of velvet skin. The fat, reddened head had wedged itself underneath her vulva, introducing itself to her apprehensive little quim.

"You don't have any hair down there. I trim up a little bit sometimes, do you want me to..."

"No," he cut her off, taking her firmly by the shoulders. "You do whatever you want. I personally think your fluffy-stuff is perfect just the way it is. Dragons just don't have any."

"Thanks," she demurred, suddenly embarrassed that she'd shown him that insecurity. "We'd better get you cleaned up before we get too distracted. We're not here for the Presidential bathroom suite you know."

"I could quite easily forget all about that right now." He devoured her glistening, bronzed curves with ravenous eyes. A finger traced the magnificent slope of her right breast, making her eyelids flutter adorably. "You know, we could just magically disappear ourselves away somewhere."

"Tempting," she moaned, just coming to grips with the delight of slowly pushing her throbbing clit against the spongy ridge of his crown.

His erection promptly ruined the moment. In its excitement, it gave a mighty lurch against her sex. A gush of slippery precome splashed against her sensitive, pink flesh.

"Eeeek!" Hailey squawked, sapphire-blue eyes wide with astonishment and a little indignation as she looked up at him. It felt like the monster was about to try bulldozing its way inside her. "Stop that!"

"Can't help it," he rumbled, stepping away from the tempting, pixie-like blonde. One big hand couldn't help lingering to tweak one of those perfect, cone-shaped pink teats. "You'd better get out while we're both still in control. I think it would be bad form to get caught fucking in the President's guest bathroom. What would Rogers say?"

"We'd probably be shot."

"How's that for a headline." Chris scowled, she hadn't moved, and there was a devilsome little smirk on her lips. "You were getting out?"

"Yeah, I guess I'd better," she smiled a little wistfully, finally turning to the glass door. What had gotten into her? She felt powerful, her bison, stamping and snorting, close to the surface. It felt like she'd just been zapped by a static shock of sexual energy. The muscles of her core were quivering in anticipation. She had the sudden urge to pull the sort of moves she'd seen her Mom use around the house before Dad inevitably chased her up the stairs, giggling all the way to their bedroom.

At the stall door, suspecting exactly what it might do to his throbbing member, she made a show of bending over right in front of him to retrieve his boxers, offering him the perfect view of her naughty, juicy, golden-fuzzed little box. A glance over her shoulder sent a shiver of thrill up her spine as she slowly straightened. He looked hungry, almost scary, ready to gobble her right up. She made her escape before he could pounce, punctuating her exit with an absurd little wiggle of her hips.

"Damn it, Hailey." His exasperated words followed her. "I can't meet the people from NASA with a hard-on."

***

Chris and Hailey had been waiting with increasing nerves for over half an hour. It felt decidedly strange to twiddle one's thumbs in the President's dining room.

Despite tasteful decoration, the beautiful dark-wood table, and the exquisite chandelier above them, Chris thought it felt a bit lifeless. It looked more like a dollhouse or a museum than anything he would personally want to sit around in for a family meal.

After the temptations of the shower, Chris had dried their clothes with judicious use of one of his orbs. When you forbid water from entering a portion of space, instant garment drying is amongst the most mundane of applications.

Hailey was back in her original outfit, but his own shirt and hoodie were utterly ruined by drying blood. He'd tried to magically clean them, but the dead, ruptured cells had degraded into a complex mixture that flouted his ability to mentally define. It was no longer simply 'blood', not that there was anything simple about blood on a microscopic level. He now understood that thanks to Hailey. Therefore his magic failed to remove the browning stains, leaving the garments completely unpresentable. Absently, he wondered if it might have worked if he didn't know any better.

His jeans were barely any better, but as his last bastion against being presented to some of the nation's lead scientists in his underwear and a stolen bedsheet, he was about to wear them anyway.

Rogers saved the day. Apparently one of the Secret Service guys was really bulky too because the blue tracksuit and t-shirt Chris was given fit pretty damn well. He felt awkward wearing someone else's workout gear while Hailey redonned her tidy, flattering ensemble but there wasn't anything to be done about it.

Looking much like his imagined cliche of an early nineties street-hustler, he was ready to explain why he'd almost blown up the Moon.

There had almost been an incident when Agent Rogers was moving them through the family level to the dining room. The President's adult daughter came flying around a corner but was too engrossed by her cell phone to notice the presence of the unusual strangers. Chris and Hailey were bustled back into the bathroom before they could be seen. When she did stop, their escort stood staunch, pretending he was precisely where he was supposed to be and that nothing was amiss. He received only a brief glare and a small noise of exasperation for his trouble before the young woman swept on, intent on some mission of vital social importance.

The danger passed, Rogers snuck them down the lavish hallways and sequestered them in the dining room to await their meeting.

Distracted by their own nervous musings, Hailey and Chris both shot upward out of their chairs when the door clicked open and the President strode in. Like a queen in a hive, he was followed closely by a court of bustling personnel. Chris was mildly surprised to see the NASA guy from the press conference was there, looking even more tired and put-out than he had on TV.

"Well, here we all are," the President shrugged as two of his bodyguards did a quick inspection around the room. "Deputy Director Williamson, these are Christopher Baryst and Hailey Sibon. Chris is a government consultant... of sorts. He contacted me because he believed he could explain the incident on the Moon. I'm inclined to believe him, though I'll admit I didn't understand a lot of the details. That's why you're all here."

Ben Williamson eyed the two youngsters dismissively, sighed, and rubbed at his bloodshot eyes.

"Mr President," he spoke eventually, his deference pushed to the limit by exhaustion. "I haven't slept in well over twenty-four hours now, and you drag me down here for what? A couple of college freshmen? We've got the best minds in the world working on this, just give us some damn time. Please, Sir."

The NASA man added the last with a straightening of his back, as if he only just realised who he was addressing.

"Trust me, Ben. I know you're tired and I'm sorry, but you're going to want to hear this. I thought it was only fair you get the explanation from the horse's mouth after dealing with that rowdy lot of reporters this morning." The President smiled at the director before looking around the room as if trying to find someone. "Agitha? What have we got for lunch? I'm starving."

"It's a pea and ham soup, Sir, served with fresh brioche and a selection of cheeses and dried fruit," replied a stern-bunned middle-aged woman who'd been hovering just outside the doorway.

"Perfect!" he barked, with obnoxious enthusiasm. "Let's get down to it then."

"Coffee," Deputy Director Williamson groaned, glaring at Chris. "A whole carafe's worth of the darkest, nastiest stuff you know how to brew."

"That's the spirit." Robert clapped the man soundly on the back. "Now, let's sit down. Introduce your colleagues, why don't you?"

Dr Ivan Schmitt and Dr Isabella Kettering both looked confused and ill-prepared for the unorthodox meeting. It wasn't every day you got shoved into a small motorcade and bustled off to see the President, only for him to claim a couple of youngsters had figured out the mystery that had their entire agency scrambling.

Ivan's field of expertise was solar monitoring. The deputy director introduced him as having a long, solid career pointing telescopes and all kinds of sensors at various solar anomalies. Chris thought calling it a long career was probably putting it politely. He had the look of one of those people who was so committed to their work that they refused retirement. His appearance was tidy, but his body seemed to be thinning unhealthily in his advanced age. Despite the abundance of well-worn skin sagging around the bones of his thin face, his dark eyes were still sharp. At the moment they were attempting to skewer Chris through and through with a deadly shaft of accusation.

Dr Kettering, on the other hand, was a delight to look upon. If Chris had to guess she was in her early thirties, with a healthy, womanly figure. Most importantly to him, she had a friendly face, and eyes that were full of curiosity rather than reproach. The director explained that she worked on developing power systems for NASA's various spacecraft. She had several degrees, but her passion was engineering. After hearing 'fusion' and 'reactor' in Chris' over-the-phone CliffsNotes, the President had specifically requested that Williamson bring someone with knowledge of experimental power systems.

As the group took seats around the mahogany table, Chris noted the presence of several others in the room. A few Secret Service guys were, of course, aiming decidedly wary looks his way. After the drama out on the lawn, that wasn't exactly unexpected given their duty to protect the President at all costs. 

There was also a professionally unobtrusive general, or perhaps a colonel, listening discreetly in the corner. By his uniform, Chris assumed he was with the Airforce, but he didn't know enough about rank insignia to decide how high up the chain of command he lay.

Most disturbing was the unexplained presence of a crisp-suited blonde woman taking notes by the door. Well, that was when she wasn't fixing him with a piercing, hawk-like gaze. She had a decidedly military look about her, and an air of confident untouchability that set the back of his neck tingling. Whoever she was, she was a predator. He was about to ask for her to be introduced when a balding fellow stepped up and opened a briefcase on the grand table.

"Before we go any further, we need to get everyone here covered by a nondisclosure and bump your clearance up a few levels," the President explained as papers were passed to the two scientists and their boss. "Nothing too untoward, I promise."

"Don't we need to sign anything?" Chris asked as the three grumbled and began flicking through the ridiculously officious documents.

"That's a little more complicated," the President mused. "So far it's been agreed that you're primarily answerable to the Synod, not the laws of the nation you reside in. That means you can't go round spilling secrets, but so long as I do the initial explanation of the situation, you shouldn't land in hot water. Most people here are already up to speed."

The strangeness of that statement caused a few wary glances between the scientists, but it also piqued their interest. As they began scratching out numerous initials and signatures, Chris looked to Hailey, whose chair was almost touching his now. He took her hand under the table and gave it a reassuring squeeze.

"I'm okay," she whispered under her breath, squeezing him right back.

An unspoken tension seemed to grow in the quiet dining room as the three NASA employees signed away their souls. Thankfully the promised coffee and refreshments arrived, pushed in on an ornate beverage trolly, interrupting a stare-down between Chris and 'that-hawkish-woman.' They were served in turn, and Chris eventually accepted a dark coffee served in fine china cup, complete with saucer and all. He barely knew what to do with the delicate thing, which didn't suit his large hands at all.

"Alright, folks, hold onto your horses," the President said when everyone had been served. A gleeful hint of mischief twinged the corners of his mouth into a rather unpresidential expression as the confidentiality agreements were collected. "It boils down to this. Magic is real, there have been mythical creatures living among us for millennia, and Chris here is a dragon. Yep, I know, it's a real mind-fuck, but everyone's going to have to deal with it someday soon. We're calling it the Revelation. There you have it. Discuss."

That didn't sit too well with sceptical science types. The disbelieving protestations were still going on several minutes later despite the President's level reasurances.

"Sir," Chris muttered across the table, "Perhaps a demonstration might help convince them?"

"Okay, Chris," Robert Falconer nodded thoughtfully. "Nothing too dangerous mind, my wife will kill me if you blast a hole in the wall."

And so, Chris got the attention of the room with a gruff clearing of his throat, downed the last of his coffee, and summoned a marble-sized orb into existence from the Ether. With his audience looking on is awed silence, he took a few moments to check his parameters. Air was passing in and out smoothly, not creating a dangerous pressure gradient. When he touched it, the light-devouring boundary resisted his finger's intrusion absolutely. That was good, no one would lose a chunk of their hand if they foolishly tried to swat it out of the air.

With a final glance around the room, he picked up his saucer, held it up for all to see, and slowly ran the orb back and forth through it five times. The result was an improbable piece of swiss-cheese porcelain, still intact without any sign of cracking. 

"Be careful, the edges could be very sharp," he warned as he leaned across Hailey to slide the saucer to Dr Schmitt. 

However, Ivan was convinced it was some sort of parlour trick. Williamson examined the plate suspiciously, but Dr Kettering soon discarded it when it was her turn, more intrigued by the floating ball of darkness that Chris repositioned right over his cup. 

As he let a tiny stream of sand-like particles trickle out the bottom of the orb, the unintroduced woman by the door scribbled notes furiously, eyes alight as she glanced between her book and the magical display.

"It's incredible," Dr Kettering observed, cocking her head as she watched Chris' idle magic. "I can't help jumping to assumption that it's some sort of miniature black hole, but that's obviously not right."

Chris smiled, having struggled with the same terrifying prospect during his early experiments.

"I thought the same thing to begin with, but as you can see, matter can pass both ways. Plus, there's the fact that we aren't all having this crisis of belief from the inside of the thing, crushed into human-guacamole by overwhelming gravity."

"Preposterous!" Ivan interrupted with a disgusted grunt, flinging the holy saucer down. "Don't put any more crazy ideas in his head Isabella."

Chris could only shrug in the face of such obstinance. As the orb winked out of existence with a small flash of liberated photons, the argument resumed with even more fervor. It appeared he'd won over Dr Kettering though, or at least made her think. He didn't want to risk his usual demonstration of phase jumping, but clearly something more was required to hook the others. Stepping into the Ether anywhere near here wasn't something he wanted to repeat. With his options limited, he next concentrated hard to bring small, flickering flame to life in the palm of his hand.

"Well, that's easy!" Dr Schmitt protested. "You've got some sort of hydrocarbon being released from a tube running up your sleeve. A simple stage magician's deception!"

"Ivan, just stop for a minute and think about what you've seen," Isabella urged, a hint of exacerbation entering her tone. "Stop trying to justify fire for a minute, that was completely light-absorbing ball that somehow put holes in a tea-set. They're not asking you to throw special relativity out the window... Well, not just yet anyway, I hope? Just to keep a slightly more open-minded, and less confrontational perspective as they make their presentation."

"Fine, fine! I'll shut up. But I don't see how you stand for it, Isabella, I thought..."

"I could try something else?" Chris tried to help, though his dislike for the old grump was rising to critical levels. It turns out dragons don't appreciate the comparison to stage tricksters. "What would it take?"

"Believe it or not, I don't have all day for this," the President groused. "Chris, stop trying to convince them and just explain what the hell you were doing on the Moon. I'd like to hope someone in my leading science agency can wrap their head around it because I sure as hell can't."

"Okay, I guess." Chris nodded, wondering how best to do so..

"Well then doctors, suspend your disbelief for a minute and listen." Robert gestured for Chris to proceed.

"Hmm, where to start. Yesterday, after a couple weeks of experimentation, Hailey and I travelled to the Moon using my magical abilities. Our goal was to test the first step in our development of a viable fusion reactor, and well, we succeeded."

Silence rained, even the quiet scratching of pen on paper from the corner died for a moment.

"Haha! Sir, I'd heard you have a bit of a sense of humour, but this is... wow," the Deputy Director laughed, though not as desperately as in his TV performance. "You've really gone to some effort. I appreciate the motorcade and everything but..."

"We're not joking," Hailey finally spoke up, though her voice was quiet. "We visited the Apollo Eleven landing site, and I've got proof."

Everyone watched as she reached into the pocket of her coat and produced several of the trinkets they'd collected. She slid them the short distance down the table to Isabella; the black message disk, the cosmonauts' medals, and the Apollo One commemorative patches. All were neatly packaged in their own plastic baggies.

"Good thing you came prepared," Chris murmured. "This is one tough crowd."

"I took a video too," Hailey shocked him by sliding her phone over to the President.

"What? When? Hailey, why didn't you tell me?" Chris hissed under his breath.

"Sorry." The blonde rested her head against his shoulder as the scientists looked over the trinkets with increasing agitation.

Robert Falconer's eyebrows looked like they wanted to launch off his forehead as he pressed play and watched the slightly washed out clip. He couldn't help but get a little misty-eyed as he saw his flag returned to pristine glory and planted once again in the Moon's dusty soil.

"This is exactly the stuff we need for the Revelation press packages," he beamed at the scowling young man and passed Hailey's phone over for him to view. "I knew you were right for the job."

Chris thought he'd better keep his opinions to himself on that count. Robert had been supportive and lenient so far, and the man was writing his paychecks. Instead, he watched the video Hailey had taken of his little Moon-walk.

"Alright," he sighed, quickly planting a kiss in Hailey's hair. "I guess I forgive you. That does look pretty cool. It's actually the first time I've seen my dragon form from another perspective, too."

"May I please see it?" Isabella asked, leaving her two colleagues to quibble over the authenticity of the lunar artifacts. It appeared that Ivan's resolution was weakening, and the deputy director was glancing at the two youngsters more reverently than skeptically now.

"Sure." Hailey passed the phone over to the dark-haired scientist.

"That was you?" the woman asked Chris after the second playthrough.

"Yeah," Chris shrugged, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Though I never would have made it up there without Hailey. She's the brains of the operation."

"I'd like to hear more," Isabella prompted. While still uneasy with what she'd seen, the inexplicable excited her enough to put aside her disbelief and hear the rest of the story. Besides, it sounded like they were just about to get to the really juicy part. "You mentioned you were trying to test a fusion reactor? Is that what caused the energy burst we detected?"

"That's right," Hailey said cautiously. "We used one of Chris' orbs to create a hydrogen plasma, and compressed it to incredible density. We were only trying to see if we could seed some deuterium, we weren't prepared for the reaction to continue at an accelerated..."

"Impossible!" Ivan barked indignantly, thumping a wrinkled fist on the wooden table with renewed ardour. "You can't fuse pure hydrogen. The half-life of a proton in the sun is about one billion years before it even gets a chance to emit a positron."

"Yes, but..." Hailey tried.

"No buts, girl. This has been entertaining, I'll admit. You won't slip blatant fudgery like that past me," the old scientist said imperiously. He was pleased to see that he'd cowed the blonde upstart. "You're spinning lies and you're not even bothering to make them half believable!"

"Apologise," Chris threatened quietly, barely-restrained temper rising at the accusation.

"I... I won't!" Ivan spluttered back.

"Enough," the President stepped in. He could see that the dragon was about to escalate the defence of his girlfriend. "I want to hear the rest of what happened. No more interruptions, Dr Schmitt. Miss Sibon, please continue."

"Um, okay. Well... Chris has incredible control over anything going on inside one of his orbs. I'd already explained the current theory on beta decay as best I could. Our plan was to have him watching closely and wait for the first event we detected. We were hoping that with increased temperature, at least one might occur before we were forced to give up, and it did. When it happened, Chris got a 'feel' for what we were looking for and used his magic to slightly increase the chance of an up-quark changing to a down. It worked."

Shocked silence rained amongst the scientists. Even Ivan couldn't muster a protest, blinking owlishly with mouth agape. The President and everyone else looked to each other, shrugging their admission of ignorance.

"The reaction came alive as soon as I put that condition in place," Chris supported. "We were getting deuterium nucleating at a nice clip, and producing a ton of energy in the process."

"Incredible," Isabella breathed, her engineer's mind racing, leaping forward to potential application.

Everyone at the table was listening avidly now, wanting to hear more even if they didn't believe.

"We sort of got a bit carried away with congratulating ourselves at that stage," Hailey admitted sheepishly. "We didn't realise that the reaction was continuing on past helium-three so fast. It all happened so quickly."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
"I still think the problem was all the trapped energy," Chris mused. "I started having real trouble controlling the orb. There wasn't any risk of it breaking, I think, but I decided it was better to stop the reaction than let it carry on out of our control. I was really losing it at the end, so, I let it out. That's what everyone saw."

"Beyond helium," Dr Schmitt murmured incredulously to himself. "Hotter than the sun."

"How did you make it directional?" the Deputy Director asked. "That's the most confusing aspect of our data. We couldn't figure out any natural cause for an impact or even a solar event to create such a narrow beam of high energy particles."

"We were only about ten metres away inside another sphere," Chris explained. "When I let it go, I put a tiny hole in the reaction orb so that it was angled away from us, the Moon, and Earth. It still melted a decent trench in the Moon's surface."

"I don't understand," the President frowned.

"Here, I can demonstrate if you don't mind a slightly damp carpet, Sir."

The President agreed reluctantly, gesturing Chris to proceed.

Chris stood, walking to a side table to collect a silver pitcher of water under the watchful eye of the bodyguards. He summoned a half-foot-wide orb and poured the contents in from above. It was simple to tell it to allow water in and prevent its escape, but the scientists were beginning to be truly impressed now. "Water isn't the best, and I can't pressurise it too much or we might cut through a wall. But watch when I allow only a small section of the orb to release water. It's sort of like a water gun, but instead imagine it's filled with stuff out of the sun's core."

A pressurised stream of the clear liquid shot out, barely two feet to the right of Ivan's head. It showered him with agitated, warm mist and continued onward to splatter harmlessly to the floor. The old scientist nearly toppled backward out of his chair as Chris shrank the orb, forcing the jet to continue for another second under hydraulic force. 

"You could have taken my head off!" Ivan glared daggers at the young man whilst trying to regain his dignity.

"I'm starting to think I'd like to." Satisfied for the moment, Chris dumped the remaining water back into the pitcher, smiling wickedly all the while.

"I see," Robert scratched absently at the stubble beneath his chin, ignoring the conflict out of deference to his moistened carpet. The First Lady wasn't going to be happy about that. "Can we get that cleaned up, please? And I suppose it would have been bad if the real thing had been pointed at the planet?"

A chorus of fervent agreement swept around the table.

"We wouldn't have had a problem if our systems were more advanced," Hailey was quick to add. "I've been thinking of ways we could set parameters on Chris' orb to automatically regulate the density of the plasma within, and hence the temperature and rate of reaction. Also, if we were harvesting the energy for power generation, that would provide an outlet too. Putting a hole in it really wasn't smart, but it was what Chris came up with under stress."

"Yes, yes, a simple expansion of the reaction area diameter should have killed the reaction outright, theoretically. But how were you planning to collect all that energy?" Isabella asked excitedly. They were really getting into her field of expertise now. To even imagine that someone had sustained a fusion reaction for a few minutes in her lifetime was incredible. "What quantity of hydrogen did you start with?"

"I think it was roughly twenty pounds," Chris answered.

"They're fucking mad," Ivan shook his head, dabbing the beads of water on his neck away with a handkerchief. "If what you claim is true, you're lucky you didn't obliterate the Moon."

"Don't be ridiculous, Ivan," Isabella spoke in their defence. "Only a tiny percentage of that mass would have had a chance to fuse in their timeframe. We're not talking complete mass-energy conversion or anything crazy. I think this has incredible potential."

"I think so, too," Hailey agreed. "I've got a couple working theories for how to harvest the energy. The most promising involves surrounding the orb with a thick layer of molten gold containing a web of platinum electrodes suspended inside, possibly some carbon, too. Chris has a magical affinity to precious metals and we're not sure yet what he might be able to pull off."

"So, you're going after the neutrons. Very interesting."

Williamson whistled appreciatively, "She knows her stuff?"

"Absolutely." Isabella smiled at Hailey, who opened like a flower in spring sunshine at the small praise. "It's complete guesswork, but if they can harvest heat and neutron radiation safely, they'll have direct and indirect generation streams. It would be orders of magnitude more efficient than our best fission reactors. You could easily power a Martian base with something like that."

"You could power roughly half the country by my estimates," Hailey corrected. "Though distribution with existing infrastructure would present a huge problem."

"Why are you coming forward about this?" the Deputy Director asked. "I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact that creatures like you even exist."

"We're people too, you know," Chris corrected, though he wasn't too concerned with the slight. "I decided we'd better come forward and explain what happened after all that nonsense on TV about nuclear weapons testing. I don't want any more tension between world leaders than absolutely necessary. The Revelation can't handle it."

"You might be surprised," the President smirked wryly. "If all the preparation for the Revelation has yielded one truly positive result so far it's that the world's leaders are more communicative and tolerant with each other. I got a phone call from the Russian premier within minutes and China not long after. It didn't take us long to figure out it wasn't any of us. Though, I'm not sure how they'll feel when they find out our pet dragon was conducting experimental tests on the Moon. That might be difficult to explain."

Chris was nobody's pet, but he clenched his jaw and let it slide. That wasn't strictly true, he reflected. Sometimes it seemed like he might be Petra's or Lillian's pet. It depended on how playful a mood those experienced goddesses were in.

"Weapons testing would be easier to explain than this," Ivan muttered, but stopped his grumbling as an idea came to him. "Now wait just a moment, you took yourself up to the Moon just like that? Could you get back again? Do you think you could go to other planets?"

"Give me a few hours and I can go get you Buzz Aldrin's freeze-dried shit if that's what you want," Chris chuckled, still cultivating his grudge for the adversarial old coot.

"Don't be mean, Chris," Hailey scolded gently. "I appreciate you sticking up for me but I don't blame Dr Schmitt for being sceptical. I've read a few of his papers and he's admirably meticulous about not jumping to misleading conclusions or overspeculating. The answer is yes. I think Chris could reasonably transport cargo or personnel almost anywhere in the inner solar system, given time."

"That raises... possibilities," Williamson said thoughtfully.

"I want one," Isabella's eyes sparkled greedily and she turned to tease her new young friend. "How much does it cost to borrow him, Hailey?"

"I'd need to be convinced," Chris raised a finger to check their obvious scheming. "I've got my hands plenty full here at home without playing taxi for you lot. Isn't that right, Sir?"

"Absolutely," the President quickly agreed. "Chris is vital for our developing magical law enforcement branch and he's got a young family too. I certainly wouldn't want you poaching him for a science project until after the Revelation has gone off and things are running smoothly. Speaking of which, Chris, you and I need to have a discussion about our friend in the south before you go."

"But, Sir... Mars? Mercury?" Dr Kettering protested. "Ooo... Venus!"

Chris sighed, this Isabella woman was worse than Hailey. He could see his already scant time for leisure going up in smoke if they put their heads together.

"Look, I hear you. And don't whine, I raised your budget by almost fifty percent over the last administration." Robert raised his hands helplessly. "We just have bigger priorities at the moment, like a population that's about to go through what you just did. By Dr Schmitt's reaction, we're in for a bumpy ride."

"I'm sure it can wait, and we'll still be working on developing our reactor," Hailey spoke up. "I would really appreciate some help with that. Also, there are other ways Chris and I have been discussing to productively use his abilities. There are plenty of things to do actually here on Earth before we get carried away with the rest of the solar system. For instance, it should be possible for him to start siphoning carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere."

"You're not serious, are you?"

"What?" Chris laughed at the gobsmacked scientists. "If I can make a miniature star hotter than the sun, that shouldn't be so unbelievable. That's not nearly as crazy as some of her other plans. Tell them, Hailey."

"I don't know," she hesitated, glancing up at him with a nervous tuck of recently-short blonde hair. "Some of them were sort of out there."

"I'd certainly like to hear them," Deputy Director Williamson encouraged, collecting enthusiastic nods from his colleagues on either side. "I know a whole team of extremely frustrated earth-scientists back at Goddard who would jump at the prospect of pulling carbon straight out of the atmosphere. What else do you think might be possible with magic?"

"Go on," Chris nudged her before leaning down to whisper in her ear. "See, they love you."

The arrival of lunch briefly interrupted the increasingly animated discussion that sprung up between Hailey and the three scientists. Robert and Chris ended up excusing themselves shortly after the meal when it became apparent that the technical diarrhea wasn't going to abate for some time.

In the more private setting of some sort of old-fashioned sitting room they got down to what was, for them, the more pressing issue. Unsanctioned lunar arms testing, good-sized meteorites, or even extraterrestrials weren't their biggest concern. That honour fell to a particular demon who, it was wryly noted, probably did count as an extraterrestrial. At least they both hoped he did.

Robert Falconer had been blindsided by Michelle's fateful phone call the previous day. He admitted he was still reeling, in fact, so was the inner circle of the Revelation movement. Chris could commiserate on that front, it felt like his proverbial cheek was still smarting from the slap of Radek's unmasking. For him though, there was the added weight of his own uncertain, possibly deific heritage. Even as the President muttered about the political damage the secret existence of demons was causing, Chris gritted his teeth and swallowed his own secret just a little bit deeper.

"It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't actually call them demons," the President groused. "The word has unavoidable connotations, everyone has their own preconceptions and fears. I've got combat-tested generals pulling bibles out of their back pockets and wetting their slacks like the end of the world is coming. Any semblance of sense seemed to fly out the window as soon as that word surfaced. There are actually calls to scrap the entire Revelation, like it would somehow make the problem disappear."

"That's the thing though, Sir. Radek is an actual, honest to goodness demon, like something out of a horror movie."

"Brazil," grunted Robert. "That was more than your average horror movie, that's for damn sure. Really though, what are they, Chris? What is a demon?"

"If there's a satisfactory answer to that floating around, no one's thought to include me," the young dragon replied.

"There's the problem with selling this narrative, see... Bear with me while I play this scenario out." The President cleared his throat and put on a mock-serious face. "Good citizens of this fine nation, here are all these magical, mythical, dangerous creatures from the fairy tales and boogey-stories you know and love. They've been living amongst us in secret for thousands of years, altering our memories and sucking our blood as they see fit. But don't worry, that's all in the past now, and from today onward we'll all live happily ever after."

At that point, the leader of the nation broke off and switched to a comical, almost falsetto voice of what Chris could only assume was an attempt at evangelical soccer-mom.

"You mean it's really like Pastor Henderson said all along? Fire and brimstone, foul creatures coming to eat my immortal soul and sodomise my precious child? My little Johnny? We should kill all these demons before they get us, whatever it takes."

"Now don't be ridiculous," the President's chest swelled as he prepared to rebut his adversary in his best presidential tone. "They're nothing like demons at all. It's mostly the cool, sexy monsters from those erotic fantasies you hide from your husband. Hunky vampires, curvy nymphs, breathtaking elves, and the like. There are a few bad eggs, sure, but we can handle them. Trust us. Besides, turns out magic is real, isn't that just fantastic?"

"Well, I did always wonder about that Barbora woman two houses down. Too many cats, ya know?" the housewife mused back, unconvinced. "But hold on now, do I get magic?"

"No," the President shook his head somberly. "I'm afraid it might put you out of a job though, and your meagre life-savings are probably worthless because of the market crash. Oh, and before I forget, it turns out demons are real, too. There's at least one that we know about here on Earth. He's actually the one who tipped us off about the dragons and the fairies. But don't worry about it, trust us. Trust that your elected officials have been handling this perfectly for months now behind closed doors. We'll handle the demon, we know what we're doing."

He emphasised the last point with an energetic thump on an imagined lectern.

"Well, I say they're all demons and we should burn them, just to be safe," Robert parroted back in the high voice. "I'm going down to the department store for an assault rifle and a pitchfork just as soon as I finish hanging out this washing to dry."

"Now don't be hasty, there's certainly no need for that."

"That's probably because you're a treacherous demon, too," the President chirped comically. "I never voted for you anyway."

Chris chuckled, astonished. He never would have believed that Robert Falconer, straight-shooting leader of the free world, had it in him to put such a show of humorous self-depreciation. If it wasn't all so terrifyingly plausible, it might have been hilarious.

"I think I get the point, Sir."

"No, Chris, you don't," sighed the President, leaning closer across a coffee table that had historical significance simply by virtue of residing in the building. "Son, are you a demon?"

"What?! No," Chris spluttered, genuinely confused. "I'm a dragon."

"Well, what's the difference?" Robert smiled very softly, his tone was more friendly than accusing. "Understand, I'm playing the devil's advoca... Jesus H Christ, you know what I mean."

"Yes. Well, I guess it's sort of hard to prove that I'm not a demon when there's magic involved, or that I'm not a sorcerous carrot in disguise for that matter. But I have a whole family who could testify that I haven't collected the blood from any butchered farm animals... recently."

"Calling all harem members to the witness stand," the President chuckled, cupping his hands around his mouth as if to summon his brood. "Keep digging."

"But that's got nothing to..."

"So you do live in sin?"

Chris threw his hands up in defeat.

"I saw you and Vanessa trying to bore holes in each other back there," Robert sat back, smiling wryly at the predicament they were all in. "One of Michelle Hamund's contemporaries. Ex CIA, and it's her job to plan for... contingencies. Let me tell you, she's getting a lot more support after yesterday."

"So that was the woman who stole the scowl off a bald eagle?"

The older man chuckled at the description.

"Don't even get me started, I heard an admiral once joke that she could shoot down a Nimitz-class full of jets with that stare. Called her a national treasure. She's good at her job though, very good."

"Well, I've got two jets of plasma for her if she ever continge-i-cises me," Chris grumbled, mostly good-naturedly. "Let me try to fill you in on as much as I know. In the end, all we can judge anyone, or anything, by are their actions. I'm at least trying my best to help."

"I know, Chris. I know."

It took quite a while, and Chris had to draw on all of his patchy knowledge of ancient Being lore to bring the President up to speed about the Barrier, Radek's logical target, and the eons-old war fought by incomprehensible powers for the fate of the planet. Again, he declined to mention his own theorised connection to that struggle.

They shared a deep worry that the Synod wasn't handling the issue competently, not that either could think of a winning scenario for dealing with a provoked demon on the run. It just didn't sit right to back off when they had come so close to taking him out.

He also warned Robert to keep an eye out for irregular occurrences around the White House. The localised concentration of hostile Ether denizens was alarming, but at least they didn't appear to be preying on humans. He couldn't think of an explanation or an immediate solution other than to be on guard.

The President was eventually called away to other duties, reminding Chris about the upcoming UN summit he was on the list to attend. When the young man grumbled, Robert doubled-down on pointing out the importance of having Beings visible to meet and talk to leaders and policymakers at the ratification of their own damn treaty.

After a firm handshake and a pat on the shoulder, Chris was escorted back to find Hailey. In his absence, the talk had grown even more technical. It was interesting, but he mostly sat it out patiently, chipping in here and there. Hailey was a well and truly out of her shell, animatedly outlining her ambitious plan for the Sahara desert. Following behind, several even crazier, truly experimental schemes like her muon trap were thrown on the table.

Her audience lapped it all up, sceptical yet cautiously encouraging. Seeing was believing to these types, Chris thought. They certainly seemed impressed with Hailey's grasp of physics though.

Exhausted, Deputy Director Williamson inevitably succumbed to sleep, slumping in his chair. The dragon decided that that was their cue to leave.

They exited in the most mundane way possible, the East Wing main entrance. After a brief consultation of their phones, they caught a cab across town to Rock Creek Park. 

Hailey was a-buzz with excitement and a renewed lust to forge ahead with her projects. Isabella's business card burned like a fiery ember in her pocket. The researcher had been manically enthusiastic to work with them in any way she could, even offering to drop her current projects and come to visit Hailey in Denver for a few weeks.

She was almost skipping, and only a little disappointed when they had to forgo a trip to the Smithsonian Zoo, despite her high-spirited pestering. Beside her, Chris loomed massive, stalwart, and more serious than usual. Something was weighing on his mind, she could tell. The dragon was about as forthcoming as a slab of granite though, so she ignored his mood to focus her mind inward toward the challenging tasks ahead.

It took half an hour of walking in the cold afternoon breeze until he was satisfied that they wouldn't be seen. Finally, they slipped off the wooded path into a little ravine, ducked under a footbridge, and phased all the way home.

Radek didn't mind the cold, at least he'd told himself that before. But as he half-trudged, half-tumbled over the last frozen ridgeline and saw the end of the accursed snow far below him, a shudder of palpable relief swept out to every nigh-frozen extremity.

Ice bearded his eyelashes, gnawed at the exposed hand that could not risk releasing his precious cargo. He'd spent another three hard-earned souls just to make it over those damned mountains with some reasonable speed, putting distance between himself and his pursuers. He hadn't dared take any of the major passes, instead relying on slowly burning through his precious energy to bound up and across the apex of the continent-dividing range. It had been arduous, a constant battle against howling wind, savage cold, and sticky spring snows.

At one point, his bellow of frustration at tumbling down a particularly steep slope had triggered an avalanche in the peaks above. He'd been battered and bruised, buried under an unstoppable white tidal wave. But he didn't let go of the briefcase. It took more than an hour to dig himself out without the use of easily detected magic.

A terrible mood was upon him when he finally slunk down onto the rocky slopes exposed by the springtime melt. His primal rage burned hot, but did nothing about the bone-deep chill that had taken up residence in his miserable human body. 

Eventually, he made it down the mountainside into a verdant forest. Two hapless hikers crossed his path and were quickly devoured, leaving behind blackened, crumbling husks. That went some way to appease, and he finally found a place to collapse in exhaustion after disposing of the corpses, carefully this time.

His sanctuary was a small, sunny clearing, carpeted with lush growth. He slumped with his back against a warm boulder, pulling the briefcase to his chest with shivering, frost-bitten hands. A plucked thatch of moss soon took the role of pillow, sacrificing its life for the comfort of his neck. This shaking, aching, construct of a body was a pitiful thing. It felt like hours before he warmed and relaxed enough to sleep, and even then it was restless, unsatisfying. His mind was full of snapping jaws, wolf's snarls, and that bitch-elf's smile as her arrow sank into him. Failure had never been so close.

He started awake at the sound of bestial grunting and snapping twigs. For the tiniest fraction of a moment, Radek sleepily wondered how, after all this time, one of his demonic brethren had found him. It must be a lowly creature indeed to slip through the Barrier, a newborn imp or perhaps an idiotic garzan. Nothing that could actually assist him now would ever fit through a sliver of a rift like that.

A family of wild pigs oinked their way into his clearing and began rooting amongst the tender shoots that were getting a head start on the growing season. Radek sat up, his mind clearing as he realised the true source of the confounding sounds. To his own surprise, he wasn't angry. It was a sign; he even smiled, how fortuitous that his dinner ran right into his lap.

As a young hog spun slowly in the air above his fire, sizzling and releasing the most alluring scents, Radek considered his options for what felt like the umteenth time. Far to the north, he could barely sense his small minions winging tirelessly to find one of his last potential allies.

So much might depend on the response, but Radek was shaken by how close he'd come to ruin. This plan was so long in the making, so vital, and he'd gambled everything on its success. With a shake of his head, Radek knew it was too much to rely heavily on one such as Azenoth.

It was make or break for Radek now. To succeed, to offer up such a prize as this bloated world, would elevate him to the ranks of her most favoured generals. No, he would claim the position of consort! A shiver of ecstacy crawled up his spine. Even the thought of such an ambitious elevation set his cock hardening. To fail, however. Well, if that was his destiny, better to let these filthy creatures finish him rather than face her wrath again.

Azenoth could not be his linchpin at this late stage, treacherous half-spawn that he was. No, he would have to execute his personal revenge against the fledgling dragon in careful synchronisation with whatever diversion Azenoth could provide. The window for passivity, for gathering strength was already slamming shut.

"Yes," he murmured to himself as he reached over the flames to rip off a chunk of fatty, succulent meat. "Time to lose this pathetic shell."

To the north, there must be a large city. Radek could hear the clamour of souls, they called to his hungry power. There lay the opportunity to cause enough havoc to complete his preparations. He was tired of running. Fleeing into the desolate fiords to the south would only leave him more exposed when his hunters next caught up to him. No more.

Contented, he closed his eyes as he popped another tasty morsel in his mouth, savouring the smoky, wild taste. He could feel the faint tug, the approaching conjunction that, combined with his... lengthy preparations, would bring him glory and favour beyond imagining.

Already the enemy's Barrier was subtly rippling in response, not unlike the ocean's tides in response to the tug of the Moon. It was still a minuscule thing though. He wondered if its creators had ever considered such an attack? Probably not, if he'd already made it so painfully close to success.

Fitting then, that the spell which had thwarted his kind by inserting magical instabilities into their rifts, would now be exploited with similar finesse.

It wasn't long now. Eons spent alone and starving, a prisoner of empty, sourceless darkness didn't matter now. They were all about to pay dividends, and a more glorious and fitting reward he couldn't begin to imagine.

***

Immi bowled into them immediately when Chris and Hailey merged back into the apartment. A hip height, blue-winged missile of happiness.

"It's snowing!" the sprite chirped excitedly, clambering up Chris' body to cling around his neck.

"So it is," he chuckled, walking them to a window to look out on the slushy white beginning to blanket the streets below. With wings quivering in childlike elation, Chris could tell she desperately wanted to run outside and frolic.

"It's pretty late this year," Hailey observed as the thick, clingy sludge began to settle on the sidewalks. As a Denver local, she was used to a snowbound life for much of the year. It didn't mean she liked it, but it was great for staying warm indoors, studying, reading. Or, she imagined, romancing a hunky dragon.

Petra ghosted up behind them, given away by the quiet clicking of her heels. She slid a hand around onto his abdomen, pulling herself close as she nibbled the back of his neck affectionately. That effectively completed the brood sandwich, crowding him gently against the window with palpable affection.

"It's a wonderful time of year for... indoor pursuits," the dragoness teased saucily, her full breasts pillowing just below his shoulder blades.

"That's just what I was thinking!" Hailey laughed, refusing to relinquish her position on his right side. Not to be outdone, she buried his elbow between her own bust.

"Can we go up on the roof?" Immi begged from his left. "Please, Master? Please, please, please. I'll be good, I promise."

He gave her full blue lips a kiss, keeping her quiet. "Alright, little one."

"Not for too long," Annabel spoke up from the living room. "Michelle's plane is landing soon, and it might be nice for Chris to meet them all at the airport seeing as he left them high and dry on their mission."

"That's probably a good idea. Thanks, Dee. Anyone else want to come along for some snow fun?"

"Not on your life," Petra snickered. "I think I'll have a nice warm bath while you two freeze."

"No thanks," Hailey demurred. "I want to make some notes while it's all still fresh in my mind."

"It went well then?" the silver-haired dragoness asked. "You averted a nuclear calamity?"

"It went okay," Chris frowned. "No calamity to avert actually, but we're alive and well, and Hailey has a new friend. I'm concerned though, the Ether around the White House was full of nasties I've never even heard of before. We got caught unprepared, ambushed by a huge flock of what Hailey thinks are shrikes. I got stabbed by some sort of dirty hedge-lurker, and the ground was lousy with leeches."

"Oh, my!" Immi squeezed his waist tighter with exquisitely toned legs. "That sounds terrible. I've had to run from shrikes several times, nasty, wicked, eyeless beasties! They should all be exterminated, right after the fairies."

"It was damn scary," Hailey admitted, watching Chris shake his head at the sprite's casual genocidal pronouncement.

"I'm glad you're safe, Sire," Petra nuzzled against his skin. "You'd better go if you plan on tiring Immi out before you head to the airport."

Much to Immi's protest, Chris made her put on a wing-customised t-shirt and tiny spandex shorts before they went up to the roof to see the snow. The building wasn't particularly high though, and he only took a few steps onto the roof before he bustled the pouting sprite back inside. It was way too exposed to other buildings, and the constant whine of various ventilation units was intolerable to his enjoyment anyway.

He jumped them to Jethry's front doorstep. They weren't disappointed. A solid half-foot had already settled on the ground and juicy, huge flakes were falling steadily from the heavens. You could barely see more than thirty feet in the near white-out conditions. Uncaring, Immi shrieked joyously, flung off her clothes, and ran flapping out into the yard without a care.

It must have been infectious because Chris followed her lead moments later. He chased the squealing sprite in his naked hybrid form. Around the house they went, and out into the pristine snow covering a large field. When he finally caught the mischievous little nymph, he dumped her unceremoniously into a forming drift. With no clothes to stuff snow inside, he rubbed great handfuls of it all through her beautiful, dark hair. She hollered her outrage, promising dire retribution as soon as he let her up.

The ensuing magical snow fight was epic.

With muttered incantations, Immi summoned herself a vast, ten-foot-high castle out of the falling flakes. The damn thing came complete with battlements, miniature snow-flinging catapults, and an even higher tower from which to command her wintery dominion.

Chris had to retreat wholesale from the ferocity which met his first assault on the wall. She cackled like an evil wizard, flinging huge volleys of snowballs to pelt down on him. These were followed by wild bolts of vivid lightning as her siege engines reloaded. He'd barely weathered that storm, only just making it to the shelter of the castle wall. It was as he attempted to get a grip on the icy surface to claw upward when she dropped a full-sized snowman on his head.

"And that's why you don't mess with my hair!" she laughed as he ran from her vengeance.

He caught his breath outside of the range of her snow-slingers, wondering how he was going to defeat her. To be honest, she'd sort of scared him with her ferocity. His entire right arm tingled maddeningly where she'd zapped him!

In the end, he came at her with his orbs. She screamed and wailed how much of a dirty cheater he was as he swiped huge chunks out of her fortifications. Another dark orb acted as a shield above his head, placidly absorbing everything she could think to throw at him. He couldn't see what she was using for ammunition, but he would have sworn he heard a plaintive bleat and some indignant clucking near the end.

When only her tower was left standing, and she was hopping mad atop one of its frozen crenellations, he struck. Phasing upward faster than one of her lightning bolts, he vanished. Immi only suffered a moment of confusion before he pounced on her from the snowy sky like a bird of prey.

They tumbled together as her snow-tower collapsed around them. Eyes wild with excitement and a healthy dose of terror, she fought him for all of two seconds before morphing into the persona of a coquettish, vanquished princess. It seemed she was quite eager to become the spoils of war, boldly offering her virtue to her conqueror. Apparently, such was the custom in these harsh, imaginary lands. Who was he to buck tradition?

Neither of them minded the cold because his cock quickly swelled as she squirmed her torso against it. The little minx pushed her arms together, smooshing her growing breasts on either side of his throbbing erection. Her small hands were warm and teasing, heated by the magic she'd just been channelling. That wicked, pink little tongue of hers was exquisite, darting out to lap up his dribbling pre-ejaculate or tease his massive knob and its pronounced coronal ridge. 

She jerked him like a pro in the ruins of her castle, worshipping his manhood as she demanded her reward with lusty eyes. With plump blue lips, she kissed every inch of him, paying particular attention to his cold-shrunk, hefty testicles and their maddening, musky scent. Muffled, content noises, combined exquisitely with her pure eagerness and the lingering excitement of the recent battle. It didn't take long for his throbbing shaft to cough up what it owed. Immi was one happy, overwhelmed, greedy little cum monster as she fed to the point of bursting.

When Jethry arrived from one of the back fields to investigate the kerfuffle, he found them cuddling in a perfect little igloo, complete with crackling magical fireplace. The sprite's blue tummy was bulging, and she was in an almost drunken state of lazy bliss. Outside, two sheep and a small flock of hens he didn't recognise wandered confused through the disturbed snow.

"Get on home, ya horny cretins!" the old werecat laughed, eyeing Immi's perfect, fun-sized assets openly as she stumbled back toward the house to collect her clothes. "Damn, son. You're fitting to cause yourself trouble with that one when she's grown. Good thing you're hung like old Kellerman's stud donkey, huh?"

"Shut up, Jethry," Chris groaned, unable to contain his own humour and embarrassment at being caught naked in the act. 

"Pishaw, you just bring that sweet vampire with you next time you want a tumble in the snow. Now them's some tits I gotta see before I die."

"Now there's one that's a handful in the bedroom." Chris shrank ever so slightly back into his human form and began helping the old werecat round up his new stock.

"No kidding," Jethry enthused. "More than a handful if I'm not mistaken."

"That's not... Okay, alright. Credit where credit is due. What I meant was that she can be quite demanding, and she's into some stuff I... Jethry, have you ever, you know... a woman's bottom?

His mentor grunted in surprise, stopping in the falling snow to look up at Chris as a huge grin split across his face.

"I fucking knew it, ha! Have I got a story or two to tell you..." he trailed off, darting in to punch the dragon's shoulder playfully. "You hold onto that one for dear life, son. A woman who genuinely loves it in the butt is worth her weight in gold. Especially if she wants to tackle someone like you. Just for God's sake be gentle with that damn cannon you're packing."

They trudged back toward the white-covered farm buildings. Jethry regaled him the whole way with tales containing questionable advice and vivid details. If they were to be believed, he had his eyes opened to those particular delights almost a half century back, when he stumbled across a beautiful, lonely water elemental in the Northern Rockies.

"I can't believe what I'm hearing," Robert Falconer glared around the dim, mostly screen-lit room. The blue tinted light made some of his advisors look positively ghoulish, exaggerating haggard expressions and dark-rimmed eyes. At least some of the men and women he'd handpicked for their jobs had the decency to avert their eyes in what he could hope was shame. "That young man is the most promising magical resource we've discovered to date, and thanks largely to Hamund, he's actually cooperating with us. Now you're telling me you want to jeopardise all of that because you're what? Scared? Co-fucking-operating. Look it up, it requires good faith between the..."

"Sir," Vanessa Harwell interrupted fearlessly, leaning forward to address the President, seated at the head of the table. "Michelle Hamund is likely compromised. No one is suggesting that we have him eliminated in the near future, simply that his claimed powers require a re-thinking of our strategy when it comes to Christopher Baryst. We need to be prepared if the relationship sours for whatever reason. With all due respect, he is too dangerous to assume he will always be on our side. From what I heard today, he could just about step out of thin air at any moment and kill us all from behind an impenetrable death-ball. There wouldn't be a thing any of us could do to stop him."

The President took stock of the reaction around the 'war-room', glancing from face to face. It was the fucking demon thing, he knew it. His fist clenched hard in frustration, hard enough to make the old shrapnel wound in his right hand groan in protest. There was a tendon or two in there that had never quite healed right, but he'd always counted himself lucky. He'd seen what happened to the poor bastards on the other side, cooked alive inside tanks-turned-oven by his incendiary penetrators. He sighed, more of a careful exhalation really, feeling the weight of leadership. It was an iron yoke on his shoulders, crushing him like it never had in his military days.

"That's exactly right, Vanessa, he probably could. In fact, he could be listening to this very conversation for all you know, any Being could. How do you think he would react, then? Would he be justified doing exactly what you just outlined? I know I certainly would laugh off a room full of supposed allies plotting how to stab me in the back, 'just in case'."

A nervous silence grew in the room, but the President had only paused to let the point sink in.

"While we're at it, get your collective heads out of your asses about the sex. So he sleeps with a few women, good for them. Direct your indignation more constructively toward the hundreds of cases of domestic abuse and sexual assault that slip through the cracks every day."

The silence returned, and this time, Robert Falconer desperately hoped it was a thoughtful one as he closed his eyes and prayed for strength.

"Damn it, Robert, we're the government," a gruff voice spoke from further down the table. Robert didn't have to use his tired eyes to recognise it. "You can't have someone that powerful running about without some sort of leash. It sounds like he's a walking, talking nuke."

"You'd take all this lying down, would you, George?" Robert smiled, flipping the tables on the tough old veteran. "In his position, I mean? You'd roll over and let a bunch of scared, old bastards with inflated opinions of themselves sucker punch you, and essentially hold your family hostage?"

"Well... No, I guess not, but..."

"There isn't any but. I talked to him one-on-one this afternoon, actually asked him to his face if he was a demon," Robert chuckled, remembering the young man's confused indignation. "He said all anyone ever actually has to judge someone by are their actions. The same applies to us, collectively as a nation, and individually as its leaders. You know, there isn't any anonymity, any real protection screening our actions here behind some 'magical governmental spell'. That's a delusion we create for ourselves, and it's a deranged one if you think it will hold water to an elf or a dragon. I've had enough for tonight, but think on that before we reconvene tomorrow. Re-calibrate your moral antenna while you're at it. This isn't a war, I don't plan on making it into one. Until it is, I won't stand for this brand of caveman problem-solving. We'd probably lose."

Naturally, Chris didn't make it to the airport to meet his returning heroines. When he and Immi returned to the hotel suite, chilled and yet invigorated by their frisky lovemaking, everyone was already there, waiting. His broodmates were chatting amiably amongst themselves or chipping in to help Annabel with the last minute preparations before dinner was served. 

Reyla's presence was a surprise, her contribution to the successful mission earning the elf an invitation to share the meal.

"I...sorry, Michelle," Chris walked straight to his most recent brood member and gave her a tight hug. "You know I didn't mean to skip out on you."

"It's okay," she murmured, letting herself relax into his comforting embrace despite the protests of long-held instincts to avoid public affection. That was the thing with Chris, when he touched her, when he held her, she couldn't help but let the stress and fatigue just drain away, responsibilities be damned. Right then she didn't care that he'd been off blowing up the Moon and couldn't help her in Argentina. She was just glad to be home, to feel his arms wrapping her in a warm blanket of acceptance and affection. Now that they were also lovers, she also couldn't help the small shudder of desire that ran up her spine in response to his touch. "You can make it up to me tonight. I bargained with Annabel for it to be my turn."

"I can't wait," he murmured quietly, squeezing her tight.

Michelle looked up at him meaningfully, sheltered from the view of the other women over his shoulders. She went up on the toes of her boots to breathe her request in his ear. "Chris, tonight, I want you to fucking ruin me."

His blue eyes dilated in anticipation as he nodded, silently accepting her avid desire.

"Hailey stole my night," Claire grumped, flicking long red hair tempestuously over a creamy, exposed shoulder. Her flannel pyjama bottoms and form-fitting tank top were at odds to some of the more professional, or tactical attire worn by the other ladies, but they had thrown out any pretence of a dress code long ago.

"You know the drill, Claire," Annabel shot back as she brought a piping platter of buttered, steamed greens to the table. "If you miss out, it's up to you to sneak in some special time off the books. And I hardly think you're in a position to complain, what with the way we all hear you shrieking most mornings."

The young dragoness stuck out a pink tongue at her First, wobbling her head back and forth absurdly.

"I'm sorry, Claire," Hailey apologised nervously, still not used to the good-natured, but sometimes intimidating banter of a full-brood gathering. It wasn't easy for her to accept talking so openly or cheekily with powerful Beings like Lillian or Petra. Lady Narlakis' presence wasn't helping one bit either. Her whole life she'd been at the bottom rung of magical society, and now they were trying to treat her like an equal. No, more like family.

"It's fine, don't worry about it." The fiery dragoness beamed at the young werebison, slinking over to put a friendly arm around the uneasy blonde's shoulder. "I was just taking the opportunity to whine about Michelle being in for a delicious evening. I understand things like going to the Moon pop up every now and then. Just the price to be paid when we're mated to an ancient godling, huh? I'll just have to wait another week for my night of cuddles. Hmm, maybe I'll have to start doubling up with Mom, like Annabel and Immi."

"No, you don't, young lady," Petra waggled a finger at her daughter. "You're a terrible hog, and I need Daddy's full attention."

Lillian let out a throaty chuckle of approval.

"If you think we're getting extra nights because there are two of us, you're delusional." Annabel swatted the redhead's bottom with an oven mitt as she went back to the kitchen for another dish.

Reyla took that as her cue.

"I did wonder how you were running the sleeping arrangments... Daddy." The elf's snowy eyebrow arched as she grinned, pointed black ears tingling at the chance to fluster the dragon. "This is not at all what I would expect from one with a magical link to the Devine."

"Don't look at me," Chris shrugged as he reluctantly let Michelle go to greet the impatient vampire-goddess. There was only so long you could safely ignore Lillian's menacing hover. "I might be the dragon, but Annabel lays down the law around here."

"It's better that way," Susan explained as she helped Annabel by bringing out a pitcher of water and some glasses to the table. "No favouritism, unless Lillian gets pushy."

Lillian didn't see any reason to dignify that barb with a response, or to delay her own meal for that matter. Rather, her small vengeance and sizable appetite were taken out on Chris as she promptly sank her fangs into his shoulder.

"Ouch!" he protested, she was being none too gentle. Powerful arms snaked around him, squeezing hungrily as she latched onto his neck. "Damnit, Lillian, you're like a damned rabid octopus, I swear."

"Well, she's eating for two," Claire chortled.

Lillian squeezed him harder still, a contented, purring constrictor sucking the life right out of him.

"Hey!" Immi tiredly raised a lazy hand from her swollen tummy. Her small blue digits barely coming above the top of the reclining chair where she'd collapsed to gesture in an encompassing motion at the assembled ladies. "Chris is getting some octo-pus... get it, Reyla?"

A chorus of groans answered the sprite's dubious joke.

"I... yes, I think I do. Not the best example of your gnatty wit, Immianthe." It was the elf's turn to be embarrassed now, though thankfully her dark skin helped hide the heat in her cheeks. Was he genuinely satisfying all eight women? The evidence couldn't be denied, already three wombs were beginning to swell, an impossible display of magical fecundity. All his mates were brimming with magic and vitality. It veritably bombarded her sensitive magical perception, a constant reminder that she was missing out. 

"Immi, don't be crude in front of guests," Petra scolded gently on Annabel's behalf. Her First was occupied, too busy trying to wrangle a colossal turkey roast out of the oven without upset, to discipline the sprite.

"Sometimes I swear there's a salty old sailor inside that adorable blue body," Chris chuckled as Lillian finally set him free with a series of lingering licks and kisses. That left him able to complete his duties as host. "Please, Reyla, have a seat. Tell me about what it was like to get out of the territory for a while. Would you like a drink? I'm sure there's a nice bottle or two of wine in the fridge."

Soon everyone was seated, and the meal was served. It was a veritable feast. The conversation was lively, and everyone ended up talking and slowly working their way through the array of dishes for over an hour.

Annabel called it her practice Thanksgiving, and the gobbler was moist and tender as could be. Chris set to with his usual gusto but especially looked forward to the turkey sandwiches he could take for lunch in the coming days. However, it was the spicy scent of pumpkin pie wafting out of the kitchen that had him practically squirming in his seat and graciously refusing a third helping of fluffy, sage-infused stuffing. He had to save room.

The best part was that the real event was still a few weeks away, and Annabel promised an even grander feast on the actual holiday.

Reyla pointed out that it was unusual for Beings to observe human festivals, but Chris quickly sprang in to advocate the tradition's virtues. He went so far as to point out tenuous similarities between the Revelation and the situation between the colonial settlers and the native Indians. It was at best a weak thread to grasp at, but there could be no ground given when it came to the defence of any banquet.

Annabel joined her voice to his though, adamant she wasn't about to abandon her favourite cooking event on the calendar just because they were now a magical family. The bemused elf was invited to join them again for the real celebration, assured by the boastful dragon that she would be forced to concede the culinary merits of Thanksgiving and his First's skill in the kitchen. He also claimed that by then, they would be settled into their new home.

That certainly kindled Reyla's interest, especially as a barrage of eager questions from his brood began to slam into him from all sides. It seemed his mates were being kept mostly in the dark on its construction, except for Hailey and to a lesser extent, Lillian. Reyla accepted the invitation, eager to see what the dragon had in store for his mysterious lair.

The cover-up operation in Argentina was, of course, the evening's hot topic. Lillian did much of the recounting, allowing an exhausted Michelle a chance to eat in peace. Everyone was eager to hear of Stemari and Balgruuf's account of fighting the demon. It was worrying that one of the Synod's most dedicated hunters hadn't been able to best Radek.

In Argentina, they'd been busy from the moment they stepped off the plane and met their intelligence service contact. Reinforcing the cordon and securing the witnesses had been their first priority before the camera crew arrived. Then, racing against the clock to meet the morning broadcast, they frantically completed as much filming as they could before night fell.

The breakout by the survivors had thrown them, turning a late night into a sleepless one for most of Michelle's team. Before dawn, they were back out at the scene with Reyla, pulling together the last details before they went live. Fooling the camera during the small live cross had been the most dangerous part. But with the elf's magic, they'd managed to make an exhibition of bloody carnage look more like a dressed movie set.

Reyla chipped in at that point in an attempt to explain the nature of the extensive illusory enchantments she'd employed. It was evidently quite impressive because Immi oohed and aahed appreciatively. That sort of complex spellweaving was beyond the rest of them though. Chris' diamond gift had proved invaluable to power the spells. Reyla was thankful no one questioned how she'd thought to snatch it up when they'd departed Denver on such short notice. It would have been terribly embarrassing to admit she'd been carrying Chris' gift with her almost everywhere she went. Despite her weak protest, Chris insisted that they would refill the large diamond for her as soon as they caught up with the back-order of crystals stacking up in Petra's books.

Overall, Michelle was optimistic about the operation. Her old allies at the NSA had successfully distributed their slightly doctored versions of the original recording, muddying the waters. The news cycle was already starting to move on, thanks in no small part to Chris and Hailey. Their unintentional distraction was proving quite useful for drawing attention away from the potential demonic crisis. The speculation of an unsanctioned nuclear weapons test on the Moon was a sensational, panic-mongering headline. The media companies were playing it to the hilt, and the lack of any other official explanation was lending the wildest theories credibility.

Reyla excused herself graciously after the meal, walking back through the deserted underground passageways to her book-filled, solitary existence. Her ordered mind was staggering after the bombardment of scents, conversation, tastes, tantalising magic, and perhaps one too many glasses of that white wine. Outside of the occasional formal banquet she was required to throw once or twice a year, her evenings were peaceful, quiet affairs. Dinner with the dragon's brood was happy chaos. Upon leaving, she found herself unconsciously fingering his diamond, hidden safely in a concealed pocket of her fur-lined robe. Her ancient bones were brimming with involuntary sexual tension as she stroked the jewel, sampling the smoky, tantalising flavour of his magic. Damn him. 

As the elf took herself to bed for some relief with a favoured toy, a wickedly ingenuous gnomish device, Chris helped Annabel clear the table. The others had scattered to various entertainments and tasks, but he could hear Immi and Claire debating what sort of movie they were going to watch from the living room. When he'd loaded the dishwasher and Annabel shooed him away, for the intolerable offence of hovering, he joined them in time to catch the beginning of some classic action movie. Immi was already cheering the protagonist, loudly. Claire and Petra cuddled together on a plush couch, the redhead rolling her eyes indulgently at the sprite's animated enthusiasm.

Chris settled beside Hailey on another lounge-set, distracting her from scribbled notes with a series of feather-light kisses against ear and jaw.

"Stop that," she eventually protested as his hands started to wander lecherously. "Chris, I'm trying to work."

"Come over here, handsome," Susan husked as she emerged from the bathroom and glided up against his other side. Clad only in a silvery, sleek bathrobe, the mature witch presented an irresistible distraction to the lusty young dragon. Her raven hair was still wet from the shower, falling loosely around her shoulders as she nestled in close to whisper in his ear. "I'll suffer your attentions for a while."

"Suffer, huh?" His eyes narrowed playfully.

Promptly, Susan found herself deposited sideways in his lap, his hands on her waist like warm bands of iron, holding her in place.

"Mhh, I don't mind one bit," she cooed back, trying her best to squirm against the firmness she felt growing rapidly under her near-naked bottom. Susan beamed up at him, feeling incredibly sexy to draw out such a swift and undeniable reaction. It was impossible not to tease him at least a little as she wrapped her arms around his neck and moistened her lips in anticipation of their inevitable kiss. "Oh, what's this I feel, sugar-bear? Are you all pent up again?"

"Well, I am now," he growled, enjoying her familiar scent and the warm trickle of her breath on his skin in the final moment before their mouths met.

The movie was forgotten then, lost as he explored the delights of Susan's loving, soft affection. His lips didn't leave her freshly washed, pale skin for more than a few seconds at a time. If they had, it would have been a personal failing. His hands became bold as she shimmied into his touch, leaking cute little noises of encouragement. The swell of her hips was a particular favourite for his ardent pawing, especially the fantastic softness right where her butt narrowed into her waist. Gently squeezing those lovely handles and running his fingers provocatively across her stomach as they frenched was divine. He could have happily continued, but it was all too much for her.

Despite their audience, Susan took his big hand and with a tortured moan, guided it inside the silky robe. Across creamy, softly padded tummy flesh, she pulled him down, down into the warm, curly forest on the slope of her mons.

Chris grinned cockily, watching her eyelids flutter imploringly as he ran his nails lightly through her full, dark bush. She was panting when he finally touched the warm, plump flesh of her vulva. Probing digits were instantly wet with a generous slathering of her slippery, buttery cream. He sank two inside her roughly, eliciting a guttural cry of pleasure that had all the women in the room looking right at them. The beautiful witch hid her blushing face against his neck as he pumped large fingers slowly back and forth within her.

It didn't take long at all. Susan came as quietly as she could, her entire body shaking as she bit his shoulder to stifle her body's cry of joy. He'd found that rough little patch not too far inside her vagina and worked it diligently, rubbing his moistened thumb over her throbbing love-button at the same time. Only, he didn't stop when she began to shudder violently and claw at his arms to get away from the intense oversensitivity brought on by his insistent fingers. He forced her sensitive flesh to endure pure torture, another, much less discrete orgasm.

"Beautiful. My beautiful Susan," he whispered as her ragged gasps reached their crescendo. All the while, he ran a soothing hand up and down the quaking muscles of her lower back. She dug her nails into his thick forearm in retribution, panting like a marathon runner as she rode out the almost-painful climax.

"Bastard." Susan's fist thumped half-heartedly against his chest as she finally opened her eyes. Her body twitched fitfully for several delicious minutes before she could eventually relax. Flexing herself up and off those wicked fingers of his, the witch attacked her lover with a firm kiss, shoving her tongue down his throat.

The dragon chuckled contentedly, meeting her passion with his own softer vigour.

Beside them, it was all Hailey could do to stop herself fidgeting. She couldn't believe he'd just fingered Susan right there and then, coaxing two orgasms from the herbalist in quick succession. Her panties were swampy enough to be a malaria risk, which she found surprising in its own right. In her wildest fantasies, she'd never even considered exhibitionism as something she would find arousing. The werebison couldn't help wondering if he was going to be just as bold and forceful with her.

Susan extracted herself a little while later, smiling like the Cheshire cat. Chris got up to escort her to her bedroom but paused as the scent of excited young werebison caught the attention of his refined dragon's snout. 

Hailey was mortified as he loomed over her, grinning knowingly. She couldn't meet his twinkling blue eyes as he leaned in to whisper jauntily in her ear.

"That'll be a dollar for the show, mistress voyeur."

Put simply, Hailey was mortified. As he followed Susan to tuck her into bed and wash up, she was left impersonating a beetroot on the sofa. A quick, nervous glance over at the dragonesses confirmed that her distress hadn't gone unnoticed. The sprite sprawled on the rug at their feet gave her a cheeky wink.

"That was hot. It's nothing to be embarrassed about," Petra shrugged, guessing Hailey's inner conflict. "Susan's got the right idea you know. You've got to be bold around here. If you want some loving, just make a move on him. So long as you're not interrupting, or stealing someone's night, no one's going to object."

"I don't mind an interruption or two," Immi rolled onto her side to smile encouragingly at Hailey. "So long as I get to return the favour."

"None of us mind a little public fun like you just saw," Claire continued helpfully as something exploded spectacularly on the television screen. "But if you want some privacy, just drag him off into a bedroom."

"What's all this conspiring?" Chris boomed, strutting out of the bathroom as he fanned the last traces of warm water off his hands.

"We're just explaining a few things. Girl stuff, you probably wouldn't understand," Petra smirked at the cocky male. He was in a fine, draconic mood this evening. "Now, get those magic hands over here. After watching that, I'm in a mood to put them to good use myself."

"Yes ma'am," he swaggered over to the dragonesses' couch, preparing to squeeze in beside her.

"On your knees," Petra bit her lower lip sexily. Claire giggled at her side, sensing her mother's mischievous mood.

Chris couldn't believe his luck, and compiled eagerly, licking his lips in anticipation as she spread her shapely thighs. Petra raised her dainty feet up onto his chest, settling down in the seat in what he read as an obvious invitation to growl at the badger. His dragon was almost beside himself at that point, she'd never initiated sex so publicly before, oral or otherwise. It was exciting, and he was itching for more after his little appetizer with Susan.

"Mmmh, that's right," Petra purred teasingly.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
Practically bursting with eagerness at the scent of her arousal, he took hold of her ankles and began leaning in to claim his after dinner treat.

"Ah, ah! I meant a foot rub you randy brute!" Petra's indignation was perfectly delivered as his face came within inches of her concealed sex. "I'm not some sexed-up vampire to let you do that to me out in the open. This is my daughter sitting next to me, young man!"

"Dammit woman," he laughed, slumping down onto his haunches in defeat. "I should have known it was too good to be true."

"Michelle will thank me."

"Go on then, a foot rub it is," Chris laughed at himself. Shaking his head, he turned toward the TV and sat on the floor next to Immi, his back to the couch. Petra arranged her legs to rest over his shoulders, so her feet dangled down onto his chest. He claimed her right foot and set to, playing over the small muscles in the sole.

"Oooo! That's it," Petra hissed in bliss as he squeezed her heel, pressing his thumb into the knots of her arch. She loved wearing high-heels, but it played hell on her poor feet. This was just what she needed.

Chris chuffed, planting a kiss on her toned calf muscle as she squirmed delightedly behind him.

"Tell me if I'm pressing too hard," he targeted a particularly tense bundle of nerves.

"Yeeeessss!" her voice quavered, undecided between pleasure and pain as he worked her over. "Oh shit, this is almost as good as sex. Who have you been practising on?"

"Thanks. Mostly Susan," he admitted, moving to gently tug and squeeze her toes, worming his fingers between the gaps.

"Me next," Immi murmured, mesmerised as he laid the worldy dragoness low with another ungodly spasm of foot-pleasure. She'd never heard of such a thing, were her feet really that sensitive? "I must experience this dark wizardry."

"Ahhhh...but...but... I'm not done with him," the blonde groaned in rapture, limply thrashing back into the leather cushion. She squeezed his head between lush thighs, obstructing any potential attempt at drawing him away. "Come back next month."

"Damn, Mom, you're a freak," Claire laughed beside her.

"Don't knock it until he gets his hands on you," Petra moaned back.

The movie played out as Chris did the rounds, treating Petra, Immi, Claire, and finally Hailey to his best masseuse efforts. Immi was hilarious, yelping and yanking her little blue feet away from him in surprise at every new sensation or ticklish frission.

Hailey had to be convinced a little, but she bowed to peer pressure in the end and really enjoyed the massage. She decided he might be forgiven for embarrassing her earlier after a few more diligent sessions like that.

Only Petra looked like she wanted to pounce on him. The expression in those enchanting green eyes promised that if he was hers that night, he would not be getting any sleep. The sweet, earthy, almost minty scent of her mating pheromones diffused thick in the air, driving his cock to diamond cutting hardness when he worked his way around the room back to her. He hadn't smelled much of those since she'd become pregnant, but he was delighted to find a new soft spot with a direct link to her heart.

Of course, this loss of control on Petra's part elicited endless teasing from her daughter. Chris suspected that Petra really was a little foot-freaky, that would have to be explored.

It would have to wait for another night though because Michelle finished sending off her after-action report. She laid claim to him soon after he'd started in on pampering Petra's feet once again. Together they wished everyone a good night, and Chris did the obligatory round of kisses before following Michelle into her room.

The two of them looked contemplatively at each other for a moment once the door closed. By unspoken agreement, they began throwing off their clothes with eager abandon.

Chris was primed to bursting from the evening's teasing. With a triumphant growl, he kicked out of his borrowed track-pants and tackled the olive-skinned beauty onto the bed.

Michelle let out a frolicsome shriek, her utilitarian black underwear halfway down her toned legs as she was born down by a wall of masculinity. She rolled with him, exercising martial training to employ his momentum and come up on top. Victorious, she pushed his shoulders roughly into the bedding, giving her a chance to admire the massive erection pressing hot between their bodies. He seemed quite taken with her breasts, so she distracted him with free rein of her tender delights as she finished divesting herself of her panties.

He didn't waste time, and soon her shy little nipples were coaxed out into the open by a warm tongue and gentle suction. Straddling him, Michelle bit her lower lip, eyes locked with his as he suckled and stroked her flanks.

It wasn't until he gripped her thigh and she gasped in pain that he noticed she was injured. That put a pause on things for a while. The large bruise was blackening right in the middle of her sleek right quadriceps. It was a nasty, motley, bluish thing with several abrasions and patches of weepy, scraped skin to go along with it. Chris realised she must have been in pain every time she put her foot down. Michelle earned a stern rebuke for sitting all the way through the evening without seeking his help. 

The tired agent just sighed as he rolled her onto her side and proceeded to lap at the area with his broad, warm tongue. His cooling, healing saliva killed the dull throbbing in moments, replacing it with a maddening tingle.

After curing her near-sightedness, and the wonders it worked on Pamela's leg, she should have known he could handle a bruise. But the efficacy of the instant relief made her prop herself up on an elbow to watch. He was entirely focused as he lapped back and forth meticulously across the hand-sized bruise. After five minutes, it had faded all the way through the spectrum to a patchy yellow, and the pain was almost completely gone. That was enough for Michelle.

She rolled on top of him, indulging him with another few minutes of unlimited exploration of her breasts as a reward. Michelle smiled contentedly as he nibbled, snuffled, and generally went to hog-heaven. It was sort of flattering that he seemed to like them so much. She peppered kisses in his hair and stroked his ears as he played, returning his affection wholeheartedly. 

"It's time for our debrief," she eventually purred, pulling her modest tit away from him with the slurp of broken suction. She kissed him hard, finding his tongue with hers as she reached between them to cradle the head of his throbbing cock. He started wrapping those solid, trunk-like arms around her, but she pushed up onto her knees, towering over him imperiously. "I was promised the opportunity to try giving you rug-burn."

"Agent Hamund, that sounds decidedly unprofessional," Chris smirked, throwing her own words back at her even as he claimed firm handfuls of her taut ass.

"Oh, God," she trembled as he dragged her dewy sex up his sternum, squishing her tender labia against his skin. It was obvious he was eager to do this for her, and just that knowledge made her leak like a faucet. He paused teasingly, leaving her momentarily stranded as a cocksure grin sprouted on his face. Blue eyes unfocused momentarily as he concentrated, then an inhumanly elongated, serpentine-forked tongue slithered out to wet his grinning lips. Her whole body tingled in excited, almost fearful anticipation as he drew her steaming sex the final inches toward that beastly, magical appendage. "That's not fair, Chris. Look at it! Fuck professional."

"Mhhh," he chuckled, taking a deep breath to savour the scent of her muggy arousal. "Don't I always?"

Michelle decided to let his ego, and that terrible joke, go unchecked. Instead, she concentrated on easing her almost-ragged breathing as he leaned up to meet her throbbing clitoris with the gentlest kiss. She moaned, and they shuffled for balance, her hands finding their way into his messy hair as he positioned her to sit directly over his mouth.

Infuriatingly, he just held her, barely in reach, gently feathering his lips across her sex. Strong hands supported her thighs like she weighed nothing at all as his nose buried itself in the dark triangle of her groomed little muff. She could feel him scenting her, his breath hot on her sensitive, plump folds. It was a maddening tease, and she began hunching her hips, pushing down for more stimulation.

"Chris!" she keened as he unexpectedly wormed that wicked tongue past her lips and right up inside her. Michelle grasped fistfuls of his hair, shuddering in frozen bliss as he slithered deeper and deeper. He was hot and thick and sinfully slippery. For all her bravado, she was by no means experienced in the intricacies of such carnal arts. But this was exquisite. She dropped her weight onto his face, crying out as he sought out a particularly sensitive patch of pinkness and worried the forked tips of his tongue across it. Fluid and heat practically splashed inside her as he shoved her forcefully toward the precipice of orgasm.

Not that anyone could tell, but Chris was smiling from ear to ear as he listened to every clue her lithe body gave him. He took pride in pleasuring her, drawing out animalistic cries of joy from his steadfast, hardworking, very-little-nonsense Michelle. She was really leaking now, her slippery fluids bathing his chin, moistening the curls of her pubic hair. That beautiful forest was tickling his nose, rubbing across his upper lip with the aforementioned promise of friction burn as her little pleasure-motor churned up to maximum torque. She didn't taste as sweet as his dragonesses, but she was undoubtedly all fresh, clean, ripe woman.

His dragon purred inside his chest, relishing the soft sensation, the taste of her eager sex. The bossy beast was a good source of tips, like curling his tongue backward inside her, creating a bulge of wriggling muscle against her most reactive zones.

He modulated her increasingly desperate bucking with firm handholds on her hips. Chuckling to himself as her brown eyes closed and she really began to shudder, he dined to his heart's content as she moaned above him. For his coup de grâce, the dragon pushed his nose down into the bud of soft flesh hiding her throbbing clit and began motorboating back and forth.

Michelle screamed, high and piercing, collapsing sideways under a barrage of pleasure impulses. She pulled roughly at his hair as her climax exploded. Her whole body seized, electrocuted by spasms of pleasure as he followed her over, squirming his tongue even deeper within her gushing pussy. She couldn't breathe, muscles locked as blissful lightning burned through her nervous system.

Lean, powerful thighs clamped around his neck, attempting to crush him. The music of her breathless grunts and cries was lost to him as his ears were smothered against squeezing warmth. Still, he lapped at her, slurping, wriggling his inhuman tongue in the tepid sea of her delight. Her bouquet ripened, saturated with the metabolites of overstimulated muscles, thickening with the release of tacky lubricant from deeper within her. His enchantment was coming along nicely then, and her body was instinctively preparing itself to be bred.

There was no respite, no relief as he bulldozed her thrumming little bean this way and that with his nose. His huge hands tugged on her hips, pulling her sex tighter against his mouth, creating a seal. Michelle could only gurgle weak protest as he began sucking the already beleaguered, swollen folds of her labia, harvesting the molten juice right out of her box like some damn anteater. He stayed inside her until it was over, flicking back and forth far deeper than was reasonable, far deeper than should be possible. He forced her to pulse and squeeze him with her with every echo of carnal satisfaction.

Finally, mercifully, that dragon-damned tongue was replaced with tender kisses to her swollen, reddened lips. Then she could actually catch her breath.

Few of Michelle's infrequent, abortive lovers over the years had come anywhere close to preparing her for that. Her entire body was flushed and warm, still quivering with disruptive aftershocks. She played her hand absently through his hair, cupping his ear as he playfully nibbled her inner thigh. His blue eyes were earnest and happy when she looked down her body. He planted a firmer kiss right over her opening before pulling reluctantly away to rest his cheek on her thigh.

"That was awesome," he blinked contentedly, her moisture glistening all over his chin and mouth. "I have to admit, Michelle, I'm incredibly aroused by how violently you climax. It's so sexy the way you lose control like that, lets me know I'm close to the target."

"Close to the fucking target?" she laughed shakily, playing a finger across his handsome, cum-glistening jaw. "Jesus, Chris, you're hitting the bullseye with every shot in the magazine."

"Actually," he turned his head to nip playfully at her soft skin. "I haven't fired a shot yet, but don't worry, I'm sure I'll end up hitting something vital. It's a large magazine, custom built."

His pronouncement sent a shiver of renewed desire up her spine.

"You're technically correct, the sexiest type of correct. You're also horrible, and much too sure of yourself. But I'm yet to not cum my mind out when I'm with you, so the evidence would suggest you're not entirely full of shit," Michelle sighed, returning a doting smile. "Somewhere in the midst of that, I think I was planning to tell you about a couple of off-the-book assignments I need you to take care of. Clearly, I underestimated the immersive nature of the experience. Anyway, I've been building cases around a few people who could use a visit from an angel or two and the big bad dragon."

"Okay, sure, but I've got to warn you, I'm the good dragon. I only visit good girls who deserve sweet, sweet loving."

"Girls, huh?" Michelle arched a dark eyebrow challengingly.

"Semantics," Chris rumbled, extracting himself and rising laboriously to his hands and knees. Above her, he seemed an absolute monster compared to her sleek, toned femininity. With gentle nudges, he coaxed her onto her back, snuffling his way up her smooth, bronzed skin until they were eye to eye. "You definitely deserve sweet loving."

"Are you sure you aren't the bad dragon?" She eyed the towering erection pointing up at her from between his legs, the prodigious helmet was already bright red and leaking. Her pussy squirmed, completely recovered and eagerly preparing a lavish reception. "How do I get a hold of him?"

"Just say the word." He kissed her, giving her no option but to taste herself on his slightly swollen lips.

Michelle moaned, wrapping her legs up around his torso. She wiggled her hips down into the duvet, instinctively aligning her pelvis for mating as their tongues duelled. His mighty cock brushed hot against her tummy, setting the muscles inside her grasping eagerly at nothing.

"I asked you to ruin me, didn't I?" she whispered, coiling her arms around his neck.

"As you wish," he smiled, kissing the tip of her nose in a final act of tenderness.

The request took a little consideration on his part. Chris began kissing roughly down her throat as he thought out a plan. Despite her eagerness, Michelle wasn't nearly as indestructible as Lillian or even Petra. Without restraint on his part, he might seriously hurt her in the throws of unrestrained passion. What he needed wasn't just brute strength or savage fucking, but a prolonged assault. He needed to give her pleasure until her body failed, until her mind drifted away. Chris smiled against her warm skin, that didn't mean he couldn't be a little rough or domineering.

Satisfied with his budding plan, he rolled them to the edge of the bed, dragging her butt to hang off the edge as he stood above her. Those beautiful dark eyes of hers were huge as he aligned their glistening sexes, rubbing himself through her rosy cleft. He slipped inside her exquisite warmth with a contented sigh, savouring the exquisite feel of her lips spreading tightly over his crown. Closing his eyes in delight, he held still as she squeezed his first few inches.

"The enchantment's working," she cooed up at him from behind fluttering eyelids, her fingers probing their taught junction. "Mmmhh, that's nice. I feel all full and stretched, but it's perfect."

"I'm aiming a little higher than nice," he growled, grinning triumphantly. Leaning down above her, Chris collected her legs over his arms and worked his hands beneath her lower back. "Hold on, Michelle."

"What... Unnngghh!" She let out a bass grunt as he stood up, pulling her into the air. In the same motion, his cock sank steadily inside her.

There was no doubt his spell was working. Watching her eyes closely, he slowly, gently let her weight press down onto him. His throbbing member was deliciously enveloped, sliding deeper and deeper through her snug channel until barely a few inches were left outside.

Michelle huffed in his arms, bucking her hips, flicking her short mane of black hair aside like a rutted mare. She was full like never before, so lost in the overwhelming sensation that she barely noticed when he crowded her against the nearest wall. She definitely noticed when he began to fuck her though.

He wasn't gentle, pushing into her with long, powerful strokes of his cream-smeared cock.

"Geeaahaahhaaa!" Michelle cried, gripping, clawing at his arms against the storm of sensations. Bracing her shoulders against the wallpaper, she began to fuck him right back with a body honed for fitness.

Through pleasure-squinted eyes, the agent demanded a smooch, tilting her chin up as an orgasm rapidly stirred in her frothing loins. When he hunched to meet her lips, he slipped deeper still, eliciting a yelp of astonished pleasure as he butted her enhanced cervix. He smiled roguishly into their kiss, panting, releasing one of his supporting hands to thumb her clit.

In the back of her mind, as her system began to overload and short out at that undeniable stimuli, she thought it was no wonder people called it a button. Michelle came on demand as he stirred his stallion-like cock within her, nudging gently at the eagerly dilating entrance to her womb. 

Even as she shook and wailed her pleasure through the walls for all his brood to hear, he embraced his dragon and changed.

Michelle's cries died in an astonished gurgle as she processed that a wave of purple scales was propagating up over his shoulders. Great wings sprouted to tower above them both, casting their rutting bodies in shadow. She felt him grow fractionally thicker inside her, becoming more pointed as he retook his grip on her ass and pulled her off the wall.

Her first orgasm wasn't even properly over as he began manhandling her swollen pussy up and down his monolithic erection in a perfect, easy rhythm with his hunching hips.

To this enormously powerful Being, she must weigh nothing. There was something intensely primitive and vastly erotic for her about being held so helplessly, suspended in the air and absolutely taken. She was a toy, his toy. To be used and loved however and whenever it pleased him. He was a dragon, she, his brood, but it went so much deeper than that. She could feel that she was loved, deeply loved. Every cell in her body somehow knew the truth of it as he took her, instinctively sensing the potency of magical energies that swirled between them. Every mutual cry of joy, every slap of flesh against flesh, every slurp and squelch of their weeping sexes strengthened the bond between them.

Perhaps it was the potency of his pheromones in this hybrid form, but Michelle suddenly felt the overwhelming draw to coax out his seed. It was becoming a need, a raging inferno in her quivering loins. For the first time in her life, she did something she'd read about years ago and began trying to actively squeeze down on him as he pulled away on the backstroke.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 9|
--------------------------------------------
"Yes!" the dragon hissed his approval, lips curling back to reveal a maw of frightening white teeth.

She understood now, the urge to breed that Annabel admitted she struggled with. It was there in the back of her mind, whispering how wonderful it would be to succumb to his love, to the urgent potency of this male. It would be wonderful to swell with his offspring, wouldn't it? How beautiful and fulfilling would motherhood be with such an attentive, capable mate?

Chris watched her succumb, felt her body flush and shudder. She began writhing against him with renewed eagerness, clawing desperately at his shoulders and kicking her heels against his flanks. Driven inarticulate with passion and pheromones, Michelle grunted and whimpered against him as he began bunny-fucking her. That's what Annabel liked to call it anyway, when he fucked her fast and shallow, pulling his fat knob repeatedly over her g-spot.

Her ass wasn't nearly as large and soft as Lillian's, nor as bubbly and well-formed as Annabel's. It was thin, muscular, and very firm. It was a cute butt, a very fit butt that matched the rest of her athletic body perfectly. In fact, he could almost completely grab each smooth cheek in his big hands. This turned out to be the perfect way to support their strenuous, frantic mating as they both raced toward release.

The shudders announcing his imminent orgasm began in the thick root of his cock, his balls pulling close and his shaft throbbing harder. Chris hissed in delight, bucking his hips up into her as she cried out, his dick bathed in luscious, pink warmth.

Michelle was really into the flow of milking him now, loving the extra friction her enthusiastic undulations brought and especially the way her clit sometimes brushed across the top of his shaft. She could feel him swell, harden and thicken in ways that were entirely unfair to her already stuffed womanhood.

Her pleasured cries were turning to wanton, unashamed pleas now, nuzzling under his jaw, coaxing, and finally begging for his seed. Well, she'd asked him to ruin her, hadn't she?

They both froze, their climax mutual and completely unrestrained. Even as his viscous white ejaculate raced up his shaft, the dragon pulled her downward roughly. He snarled blissfully, probing for the correct angle as his first thick blast splattered point-blank against her cervix. Michelle ululated primal satisfaction as he found his mark, the delightful heat of his seed blooming deeper, flooding into her depths.

As she shook uncontrollably, Michelle pressed her forehead against a chiselled pectoral and screamed.

Her body tried to retreat from the intense stimulation. Back arching, fingers scratching, she shook, knees trying to reach her armpits and curl herself into a ball. It was too much, something alien roared into her with his every spurt, she had to get away lest it sweep her out of existence.

It was no use of course, she was suspended and very thoroughly impaled. The dragon was not about to release his toy in the midst of his own lengthy climax. All her flexing about simply made the sensation of fullness stronger as her poor little quim spasmed its heart out in a credible attempt to strangle the beefy intruder.

Michelle forced herself to take a gasping breath lest she pass out, opening her eyes to look down between their sweaty, heaving bodies. Below their streaky coupling, the last of his thick shaft and his enormous testicles pulsed rhythmically. He was throbbing! She breathed out an indignant little huff, witnessing his cock buck, his veins bulge as she was rhythmically inseminated. In sync with each throb, her womb was inundated anew, absolutely flooded with molten dragon cum. There was simply too much, it was already beginning to reluctantly overflow around their tight joining.

When she looked up, he met her eyes defiantly, daring her to object. Michelle watched as a shudder passed through his powerful body. The dragon closed his eyes, a stupid, toothy grin splitting his face as he suffered in the throes of his long orgasm. She felt inordinately proud for giving him such unrestrained pleasure. Pulling herself upward, she kissed him thoroughly as his precious seed dripped to the floor. They kept kissing, and Michelle crooned and hummed throaty approval as he finished inside her with a lazy stirring of his hips.

When he was finally done, the floor beneath them was a puddle of sex. His balls and thighs were streaked with his excess. It was a truly monstrous amount of semen, like something out of one of her naughty old manga comics. It was still leaking from their snug coupling, and her butthole was winking desperately, whether to get his stuff inside or keep it out, Michelle wasn't sure.

She was blissfully satisfied, heavy all over and weak to boot as Chris knelt and placed her gently back on the bed. Exhaustion had been dogging her all day after the taxing mission, and this now seemed the perfect opportunity to drift off to sleep. It would be so easy. It was nice with him cuddled above her, still ensconced happily inside her but carefully supporting most of his bulk so she could recover her breath.

His continued hardness should have been warning enough, but Michelle wasn't yet used to the dragon's formidable appetites. She anticipated a cozy post-sex snuggle, perhaps a bleary-eyed shower together if she could be bothered, and then bed.

He was kissing her shoulders, nosing into her neck. Finally, he slithered out of her with a slippery pop, leaving her leaking and gaping. She could feel the outrush of seed, feel her opening pulse in his manhood's prodigious absence. It was gross, and somehow perfect at the same time.

She didn't realise anything was amiss as he rolled her onto her front and crawled on top of her. Only when he took hold of her slim waist and bullied his huge, cream-and-purple dragon cock up and down her tired labia did she understand that he wasn't anywhere near done with her.

Michelle gasped as he slid back inside her with a lewd squelch of trapped air. Her head shot up in alarm as he began playing just his fat knob in and out. Her throbbing labia were coaxed to repeatedly spread over his thickest part, squeezing and nipping at his sensitive ridge.

"Chris!" She whimpered ineffectively, softly bucking her hips. It stung a little as he stretched her, but her protest was more for her beleaguered clitoris, which was also receiving more than a fair share of overstimulation from his efforts. 

Over her shoulder, the large dragon-man got his feet flat on the bed and actually squatted over her butt. She couldn't look away from the sight of his glistening shaft as he growled and sank back into her tired, messy womanhood. She moaned then, his girthy helmet probing deeper than ever, demanding that she make room.

Michelle couldn't believe it, she was so full, his heavy, purple balls pressed hot and soft against the backs of her thighs. Even then, he took her hips in hand and pressed down into the bed. Those huge wings of his shuffled, spreading to either side to provide support for his bulk in the midst of the precarious mount. With a satisfied growl, he deepened the squat still further, initiating a deep, reverse mating press.

An astonished rush of air left Michelle's lungs and her right leg kicked out involuntarily.

"Fuck, Chris! You're deep, that's enough," she scowled back at him, slapping tiredly at his thigh. She dragged herself up the bed a little so he wasn't pressing in too much. It wasn't painful exactly, his enchantment saw to that. However, the sensation of him pressing into her newly reinforced cervix was still foreign and intense, especially right after an orgasm. His interest also hinted that the randy beast might just try to worm his way deeper if she gave him half the chance.

The dragon retreated, going back down onto his hands and knees so he wasn't so far inside. Curling his large body over hers, he took her chin tenderly in a massive taloned hand and kissed the rebuke off her lips.

"Sorry, beautiful, I'm getting carried away. You make me want to do unspeakable things together."

Breath still not entirely under control, Michelle kissed him back, mollified and thrilled that she was having an equal effect on him. He did feel really good in her, hot and hard and so damn thick she was at risk of going permanently cross-eyed.

Their lazy canoodling broke when he started collecting pillows to stuff beneath her hips. She could feel his phallus bucking and twitching eagerly within her, preparing for a nice long fuck as he propped her up. Smiling all the while, Michelle resigned herself to the inevitable. Lifting her hips as he directed, she got herself comfortable and tried to relax, as much as one could given her situation. So much for sleep.

Apparently satisfied with the logistics, Chris finally began to pump down into her. Michelle was just getting back into the swing of his slow, firm strokes when he paused maddeningly. Over her shoulder, she couldn't restrain an exasperated little huff escaping her lips. Apparently, he was rather taken with the squatting arrangement he'd had before. He repositioned carefully, almost tenderly, which she found endearing but not enough to stop her teasing. 

"Make up your mind," she quipped back at him.

"I think I have," the dragon growled in her ear, massaging strong hands up her sweaty back until he had her shoulders.

Michelle shivered at his tone, combined with the sensation of his balls dragging softly, slowly across the tiny hairs on the back of her thighs. His shaft withdrew to the tip, bucking, holding her vulva spread fully open for a second before he sighed and pushed deep once more.

Slipping his grip to her upper arms, Chris gently pulled her torso back into an arch. Michelle squealed, kicking uselessly at the duvet with sex-twitchy legs. Her arms and the muscles of her back shook as he began to take long, torturously slow thrusts, slicing through her ardent, filthy little pussy.

Her body rebelled, helpless against the delicious intrusion, the domination and control he exerted. In mere minutes she quivered and squirmed through a climax, eventually going limp. Still, he fucked her.

For a while, she just focused on her breathing, relaxing every muscle in her body and letting the pleasure flow through her. He was a machine, not letting up his measured pace for even a moment, heedless to her cries of both encouragement and reprieve. Sweat began to bead unbidden all across her skin, then pour off her in salty streams. Still, he thrust inside her.

She was a panting rag-doll, doing almost nothing yet out of breath and dripping. The raging furnace he stoked deep in her capitulating womanhood seemed to be sucking all the oxygen out of her blood. Michelle couldn't say it was wasted though, used as it was to smelt wave after wave of mind-addling ecstasy in her core. She came. She came. She came again, tearing at the bedding this time. Her belly quivering, tits jiggling, thighs tensing, and toes most definitely curling, she came. Still, he made love to her.

It was tantric, whatever he was doing to her. World-altering, mind-bending sex, and it should definitely be illegal. Time seemed to blend, to merge into a continuous blur of torturous, exultant pleasure. Still, he took her.

"I c... can't, I can't!" Michelle begged now, and she didn't care. Another enormous crescendo reared up inside her. This one promised to wash her away, erase every part of her except the terrible fullness, the straining muscles, the wonderfully slippery friction, and their linked, laboured breath. If he didn't stop soon, she was going to... going to... 

"I'll be the judge of that," the dragon whispered darkly, pushing her firmly down into the bed of pillows. She was his.

The noise that rose up out of Michelle's throat was primordial. A wordless mating cry that started low and guttural, finishing in a breathless shriek as he rode her over the cliff like a lathered mare.

For a moment there, she thought she might actually be dying. She was paralysed, gasping at too-hot air, completely unable to muster a response from overloaded, oxygen-deprived muscles and nerves. Then the unchained ecstasy swept upward through her exhausted body, plucking her consciousness away to soar and mate with him amongst fluffy clouds of bliss.

The dragon chuckled evilly as she succumbed for the umpteenth time. Through broken, ragged breath, he toyed the delicate bud of her earlobe between draconian teeth, snuffling lovingly into her dark, saturated hair. Down below, he still stirred, slowly thrusting his cock through her juicy, spasming climax.

Sharp white teeth administered judicious nips across her neck and shoulders, the little spikes of pain seeming to drive her higher still.

He groaned in absolute satisfaction, as her ograsm finally died. Her tightest depths were imparting the most incredibly sinful caress to the sensitive frenulum on the underside of his knob. He was loath to stop now, so he decided not to.

"See? Now that wasn't so bad, was it?" The dragon murmured teasingly, kissing her sweaty scalp as her eyelids fluttered open. "You don't seem anywhere near ruined to me, yet."

That night, he wrung every ounce of pleasure he could from her tired body, truly initiating her into the debauchery of being his broodmate. For over an hour he made slow, passionate love to her. After that most recent climax, she was insensate for a while. But they went full circle, and he eventually had her begging for his seed once more.

She was already full, so when it he could hold out no longer, the dragon flipped her back over and pulled his cream-slathered cock free of her spent, throbbing sex.

Spraying himself across her supple, lightly-bronzed skin was a delight, and he left her absolutely covered. Fat pearly streaks gleamed across her pubic hair, tummy, and bikini-lined breasts. Her eyes were held gently closed against the ribbons of the creamy, pungent stuff that gushed all the way up to adorn her face. It was even in her dark hair and splattered on the remaining pillows above her on the queen bed.

For several minutes afterwards, they just lay watching each other as she lazily ran a finger through his cooling stuff, occasionally bringing it to her mouth for sampling. Drained though he was, it was incredibly thrilling that her eyes never left his as she licked her fingers clean.

When Chris leaned closer to scoop up a thumb-load from the little muscles of her tummy to join in the fun, the intensity of her unflinching gaze caught him off guard. She seemed... something had changed. It took a second or two of studying her face until he realised that what they'd done had deeper meaning for her than their first encounter. She'd said they'd be fuck-buddies, but her soulful brown eyes told a completely different story now.

"You're really mine now, aren't you?" he asked gently as her pink tongue wrapped itself around his thumb and tasted his cinnamon-salty essence.

Michelle nodded, eyes laser-focused on him still as she sucked his spunk right off his digit. She swallowed happily.

"And after the Revelation," he paused, wondering if he should even ask. Not that he'd hold her to anything, it would always be her choice. But if he was right... "After everything's settled down, do you think we might..."

"Yes, Chris," she smiled exhaustedly, finally finding her voice. "We can talk about having children. That's on the table now, everything is."

"Michelle," he brushed her cheek, stroking some damp hair behind her ear. He kissed her forehead tenderly.

"Damn one-track mind," she murmured with a weak smile on her lips. "Too much of Petra's breeding talk, telling you what a stud you are, that she adores your cock, and how she wants five hundred of your babies."

"I am what I am," he shrugged a little bashfully, which was quite unusual while sharing so much of the dragon. "There's more to me than just dragon, as Lillian proved. Perhaps I have an imperative to spread that side of me. All I know is the thought of my mates' swelling bellies is hot as hell. The idea of a whole passel of happy little ones running around underfoot is deeply contenting."

A long, intense pause followed. Finally breaking eye contact, Michelle leaned in to peck his lips. It seemed right to offer a little reassurance

"I'm not promising anything, Chris. But we'll see. Petra isn't fucking wrong about the first two bits, that's for sure." Michelle looked accusingly down across her body at his finally limp, sex-smeared penis. "Well, I can't walk. So you're going to have to carry me to the shower. I look like someone bombed a damn dairy processing facility."

"Minus the hoards of small creatures come out to lap at the spoils," he guffawed at the image. "I can get Immi in here if you want?"

Michelle only just managed to slap lazily at his brawny arm in retaliation.

"To the shower, lover. Giddy up, before I pass out."

So Chris did just that. She was almost completely limp in his arms, but he sat her on the floor of the shower with a warm flow pattering down. He found some spare sheets and pillowcases and had the bed cleaned up nicely before he went back to join her.

That night, he stayed in his hybrid form, curling protectively around her smaller body. One of his big, clawed hands lay possessively over her lower abdomen. He worked a stealthy bit of magic as she drifted off, catalysing the energy he'd given her to fuel her vitality and resilience. She seemed so tired and overworked much of the time. That was probably his fault on this particular occasion, but she had a lot of catching up to do on his other broodmates. He wanted her healthy, strong, and safe, his tenacious Michelle.

She woke twice in the night, groaning weak protest as the insatiable dragon rolled into her saddle. He entered her for brief, passionate bouts of lovemaking, finishing quickly, deeply, and telling her to get some sleep. 

That's what she was trying to do, the big, loveable idiot.

Exhausted though she was, Michelle still found herself enjoying every moment of his midnight, teenage-eager advances. Both times, she found herself succumbing too easily to the pleasure.

In a way, it reminded her of her first few months of sexual activity with her boyfriend back in high school. They were so horny and tireless then that they could easily stay up half the night, humping like rabbits. Inevitably they would just be stupidly smiling zombies the next day, no good for classes at all.

Twice Michelle fell back asleep with her womb throbbing-full of his magic-laden seed, never bothering to wonder where his last virile effort had disappeared to.

***

There was a decided spring in Susan's step as she walked down the snowy sidewalk. The witch smiled at her fellow pedestrians, wishing any of the bundled-up ambulators who met her eyes a cheery good morning. That earned her a few funny looks, but she didn't care one bit. Wrapped snugly herself in padded jeans, a lovely cashmere blouse, windproof ski-jacket, mittens, and a fuzzy cap, not even the near-freezing temperature could dull the lustre of her good mood.

Before dawn, Chris had slipped into her room with a freshly steaming mug of coffee. Then he'd slipped into her bed and into her. He'd started with kisses as she woke up, working a hand under her t-shirt to caress and tease her breasts. Her nipples had been thoroughly molested when she tried playing coy, which she supposed she deserved. It hadn't taken him long to get down to business though, pulling her knees up between them as they lay facing each other on their sides. He slipped inside her easily, and they grinned conspiratorially at each other in the dim light. It was a joyful, simple rutting as they attempted to keep the volume down and not wake up the rest of the house.

As she carefully navigated the treacherous, sometimes icy footing on her way to work, the witch was reminded of his conquest with every step. Her womanhood was still a little sensitive, brushing maddeningly against the lacy gusset of her favourite pair of underwear. Her thighs were taut, feeling deliciously well-exercised and heavy from all the trembling and bucking they'd done. Indeed, her entire body was flush with his potent magic, practically overflowing with a sense of love and vitality. No wonder the first snowfall of winter couldn't get her down.

--------------------------------------------
The product of their lusty efforts pulsed merrily in the large handbag slung over her shoulder. The dozen or so crystals wrapped carefully in black velvet were the combined work of Petra, Claire, and herself over the last several mornings.

Susan almost felt a little furtive. Simply carrying so much magic around with her would have seemed absurd a few months ago, but they had to get to Eddard's Apothecary somehow.

Their production had been disrupted when Chris went down to Brazil and some of her regulars were clamouring for new stock. She wouldn't be surprised if the tenacious young werecat lad who ran errands for Tamara was already waiting for her in the cold. He was often tasked with arriving before she opened, ensuring first pick of the refilled gems. She would make him a nice hot chocolate this morning as consolation for his mistress's onerousness.

Denver's eminent enchantress was a demanding customer to be sure, but she always paid top dollar. Tamara dealt with Susan fairly, if with a resigned air of jealousy. The class two witch had made more than one barely veiled reference that she would like to be given the opportunity to 'work with the dragon directly.' As if.

Eddard's was really flourishing now. The spry old fellow could even be heard to grumble every now and then that he would be forced to hire someone to man the counter full time. This influx of customers, as word of the gems availability spread, was starting to deplete some of his other stocks too. When people came to the shop for a crystal, some of them were inevitably drawn into additional purchases. Potions or ingredients were right there in front of them and they would buy for convenience, if not price or necessity.

Susan smiled as she recalled the memory of the elderly wizard carefully poring over the last month's accounts and stocktake. She'd been watching, absently plucking tips from a praxius bush as he disbelievingly stroked his white goatee, frowned, scratched his balding head in vexation, and set about rechecking his calculations from the top. Rowan had later sheepishly admitted that the store had never done so much business, thanking her profusely for this turn of fortune in his twilight years. He was an adorable old coot when he wanted to be.

The sun was out, trying its best to blind drivers with dazzling reflections as the blissful witch strolled happily on her way to work. Not even the dirty slush their wheels sometimes threw onto the sidewalk bothered her. It was held at bay from her pristine sneakers by a thorough treatment of her latest waterproofing potion. They also had a somewhat experimental application of oil extracted from the green seed pods of an old sessains vine of Rowan's. She'd coaxed it back into flower two weeks ago, and the magically-insulating oil had proved to be a hot ticket item with the promise of bad weather.

Her mind wandered, exploring other ideas she might profitably explore now that winter had arrived. Surely she and Rowand could put their heads together and create some sort of gently warming balm. If it was gentle and nicely fragrant, it could be applied to hands, feet, ears, or noses to keep the extremities comfy in the frosty weather. Perhaps that wasn't her best idea, but she was confident she would come up with something useful.

Productively distracted, she rounded the corner and started up the final block before Eddard's, completely oblivious that she was being followed.

Ahead of her on the street, a parked sedan disgorged two stocky Asian men. It was the flicker of a magical aura that finally drew her attention to them. The timing made her uneasy, but it wasn't unusual to see Beings this close to the centre of town. She hadn't seen them before, but put the friendly smile back on her face and continued toward them.

The sense of unease only grew as she approached, they were looking directly at her, waiting. But she would look so stupid if she turned around and... one of the men, stepped in front of her, blocking her path. Adrenaline surged in her chest. He was fit, perhaps in his mid-thirties and poorly dressed for the cold.

"Excuse me," she tried, stepping to the side in an attempt to get around him. He was only a little taller than her, but she didn't fancy her chances in any physical confrontation.

It all clicked in her mind as he held out his arm to block her path, shaking his head sternly. Petra had mentioned something about a delegation from the Chinese syndicate being in town to petition Reyla for an export license. They were after her crystals. She glanced to her left, the other man was on the street-side of the car, opening it to help someone out.

The urge to flee was growing, making her heart pound. The man in front of her was a few paces away at least, the other fellow wouldn't be able to get around the car to chase. Susan took her chances, spun on her heel, and with her first bounding step, ploughed directly into a tiny, wall of a woman.

An astonished yelp of fright left her mouth as she tumbled backward, spinning through the air with far more force than should have been possible. The sound cut off as her face landed in the dirty pile of snow swept up against the fence separating someone's yard from the street. She was probably lucky it had broken her fall, or the concrete sidewalk might have claimed a few of her teeth. As she spat out a gritty, cold mouthful of the stuff, Susan realised that she was in big trouble.

"You should be more careful," a quiet, leathery voice spoke in heavily accented English.

Shuffling, crunching footsteps announced to Susan that she was being surrounded as she pushed up on her hands and knees. Panic clawed at her as she sputtered out the last of the grimy, freezing slush and brushed off her face. Her entire front was soaked in melting snow, but the sense of cold was detached, irrelevant compared to the fact that her handbag was no longer at her side. Strong hands gripped her upper arms, hauling her upward even as she tried to stand.

"Don't touch me!" She whipped around, struggling free of the hold and backing into the fence. She blinked desperately, blinded by the sunlight and the remaining streaks of snow and gritty water in her eyelashes.

"My, my, you are a spirited one," the old woman spoke, her kindly smile doing nothing to hide the malevolence in her ancient eyes. A gnarled cane sank deep in the melting snow as she tottered forward with the help of her underling. "Be calm witch, we are just here to make a business proposition."

"No, thank you," Susan tried to straighten herself, as she stared wide-eyed at the five people penning her against the fence. She glanced desperately over their heads for help, but as if by magic there was no one else on the street. "Not after an ambush like that. I'm leaving, where's my handbag?"

The small, dark-haired woman who'd somehow sent her flying held her bag in front of her, peering down into its depths with avid, greedy eyes. She seemed far too young to be involved in something like this, but Susan suspected a family connection to the leader of this pack of crooks.

"Give that back!" Susan demanded, sounding petulant and desperate even to her own ears. When she started forward to grab it, the young woman darted back nimbly. In an instant, the old woman's cane was between her and her bag, thrumming audibly with power. 

"Now you are being rude," the elderly woman spoke dangerously, enunciating every accented syllable carefully as Susan froze. "We are here to do business, and we have come a long way. I have left a peaceful existence on my family lands for first time in fifteen years. I come here to talk to you, to offer a chance for mutual prosperity. Now I find you are a rude woman, perhaps thinking yourself above your class."

Susan glowered at the woman, not believing what she was hearing, or that she was being openly accosted at wand-point in the street.

"Please give me back my purse. Now," she spoke more calmly, seething inside as indignation bolstered her courage. How dare they. Whoever they were, they would never speak to her like that in front of Chris. Her jaw twitched in fury, he was at work on the house right now, frustratingly nearby. "I don't care how far you've come, this is assault. Good luck explaining this to Lady Narlakis."

"Do you know how to move a mountain?" The old woman smiled enigmatically, slowly lowering her cane-wand and completely ignoring the witch's trembling rage.

"What?" Susan frowned, thrown by the sudden change of topic. Her eyes flashed around the stone-faced group, fixing on the younger woman still clutching her handbag.

"Do you know how to move a mountain?" The matriarch repeated, her stern grey bun of hair bobbing slightly as she regarded Susan. "Or, I suppose, to make a mountain."

"No. Give me back my property."

"To move a mountain, all you need is pressure and time," the ancient said wisely, shuffling carefully across the snow to look down into the handbag proffered by her descendant. "Yes. I think we will come to enjoy doing business together."

"Never!" Susan snarled. "I will never help a bunch of thieves and crooks. When Chris hears about this..."

"Ah, the dragon." The woman rounded with uncanny speed, no longer decrepit as magical strength surged through wiry old muscles. The point of her cane settled feather-light on top of Susan's foot. "I wonder what you will do if he don't come home one day? Poof! Vanish in thin air? No crystals to sell then, I think. No excuse to be rude to your betters."

Susan trembled, genuinely terrified for the first time as the tip of the woman's cane began pressing down. She tried not to whimper, but one slipped out. The magical pressure in the staff was proliferating, pinning her, threatening to pulverise the small bones beneath. The crazy old bitch would do it too, she understood that now. They'd been so stupid, not bothering to think what sort of attention selling the crystals might bring.

"Please, stop," Susan squeezed between gritted teeth, moisture gathering in her eyes, blurring her vision. It felt like a tractor was parked on top of her foot now, muscle and bone screaming protest to already crushed nerves. The others just watched, unmoved by her plight as their matriarch negotiated. Something gave inside, a quiet crunch that reverberated up her body. Susan gasped in agony, hot tears flowing freely down her cheeks to cool in the brisk air. She was utterly helpless, weak, just standing there wringing her hands like a bug pinned for display.

"I think you will like doing business with my family." The pressure finally relented, and Susan drew in a ragged, almost choking breath. It was a miracle she didn't collapse. "Yes-yes. Do your job, get paid. Never see me again, yes?"

Susan looked away, ashamed and cowed. Her entire body was shaking. Silence was the only resistance left to her now, foot throbbing hot and bruised and broken despite being surrounded by snow. It was all she could do not to curl into a ball and wail. The pain was somehow growing worse now that the pressure had abated.

"You see?" The old woman gestured around at her cronies in apparent astonishment. "Rude! I think we take possession of first shipment right now, compensation for childish behaviour. Bad business. Very bad business."

Susan spat on the sidewalk as the woman reached a greedy, claw-like hand toward her captured purse. She was proud of her defiant sneer, half expecting it to be the last thing she ever did before being obliterated.

The old woman looked slowly down at the congealing, bubbly spittle, then back up at Susan. The smile on her wrinkled face wasn't friendly, instead containing a hint of viscous eagerness. She continued reaching into the bag, eyes flashing as she silently dared the far less powerful witch to do something. Out came the black velvet pouch, heavy and bulging with the individually wrapped gemstones. She murmured something in a foreign dialect, spurring her minions into action. Stolen bounty in hand, she turned back to address the witch.

"Pressure and time, child. Pressure and time. Remember that. You had best work on your manners before we meet again. I do not think you will enjoy my lessons if I have to instruct you."

They left her there, hopping helplessly on the snowy sidewalk as they sedately loaded into their car. Without a backward glance, they drove away, her handbag discarded carelessly in the muck-filled gutter.

If it wasn't for the excruciating pain in her foot, she might not have believed that she'd just been robbed. The temptation to sit down in the snow and cry was fierce. She almost did it. Then she wanted to scream, or to run straight into Chris' arms and hear him say it was all okay, that it wasn't her fault.

No. Her anger came back then, searing, indignant, and worst of all, impotent. No. Chris would come running, and his fury would be righteous. Then he would be obligated to go after the thieves and get himself into even more trouble. He had enough on his plate without worrying about something like this.

She was pathetic. Standing there, weak and helpless as she was violated. That would change, it must change.

With a snarl of pain, Susan took a few hobbling steps to collect her damp purse. A harsh riffle provided at least some consolation from the encounter. They hadn't taken anything else, her wallet, Maginet phone, potion kit, notebook, and various other small items and toiletries were all there. Squaring her shoulders, she limped slowly on up the street to Eddard's Apothecary. Gone were the thoughts of warming balms to keep the cold at bay. No more schedules for flowering and management of her precious herbarium. Her mind raced to down much darker paths of self-torment now, though some were not entirely unproductive.

Her family, the witch side of it, was not remarkable in the magical world. As far as she knew, they had been primarily healers and potion brewers down the generations. Her own meagre gift with magic was passed to her through her father. He'd married a non-magical woman who was bold enough to ask him out to coffee one day. That was no mean feat back in the day, but her father had been exceptionally handsome by all accounts. The following romance, marriage, and ten blissful years of life together was one for the ballads if you believed her mother, who never had an inkling of her husband's magical nature.

At the tender age of eight though, Susan's father disappeared. No one could be sure what had happened, but if you knew the man, there was little credit to the idea that he'd run off into the sunset. Even at eight, Susan knew something terrible had happened to her daddy. She knew in her heart that if he could have come back, he would. It destroyed her mother.

After six months of near neglect and the 'languish' of her budding magical training, grandmother Agatha took over Susan's care. And so began the instruction in her family's craft.

Susan accompanied her grandmother in her work whenever she wasn't at school. Tending and caring for plants of all kinds, preparing ingredients, minor enchanting, and potion brewing. She had observed and been lovingly prodded to participate by her strict but liberal-minded grandmother. Amongst the flourishing plants, they had grown close, united in the loss of son and father respectively.

Neither of them were particularly powerful witches, but Agatha explained that the family's real gift lay in the care and understanding of magical plants. They shared an almost instinctual connection with anything green or leafy.

Susan fondly remembered warm nights spent in front of a crackling fireplace, poring through precious, ancient botanical volumes with her grandmother. She was fascinated by the often bizarre diagrams of long-extinct magical species, asking all sorts of questions. Agatha always seemed to know some little fact or other, even if the texts didn't. It was that fascination, that quest for understanding which had taken her to pursue a college degree in plant sciences after her grandmother's passing.

Amongst the precious books, seed stocks, growing and processing equipment, and a lifetime's general clutter she inherited when Agatha died, Susan had found something truly unusual. It looked like a fist-sized ball of black wax, sort of like some types of fancy cheese came wrapped in. However, attached to a short string melted into the substance was a personal note. Even now, hobbling tear-streaked down a snowy Denver backstreet, she could remember that faded, looping scrawl word for word.

Susan, my lovely granddaughter,

I write this, hoping that you will have no need to read it for many years to come. I long to yet have the chance to watch you grow into womanhood, to see you start a family of your own. Nothing would please me more. You have been a candle to brighten the twilight of my years, my solace in the face of a mother's grief. Know that whenever you read this, I love you with all my heart.

You're small now, such a curious, patient, soft-souled little girl. Already I can see that our family's gift runs strong in your blood, that you have the temperament. Our lovely plants are living creatures, Susan, less different from you and I than most think. They feel, they rejoice, they suffer, they mate. You are already starting to hear the first whispers of their secret language. They sing in the wind, rule over vast kingdoms in the soil, speak in vibration and scents. Listen for them.

So you see, I already know that I will not destroy this seed, that decision will fall to you. I'm sorry. Pray you will never have a need to sow it. After what it did to my mother, I've been so tempted over the decades to simply fling it into a fire and be done. I've held it over the flame more than once you know, but it may very well be the last of its kind. There is also the small debt I owe it... my life, and our family's continued existence, despite the toll it has taken in return.

Susan, if you gently steam off the wax you will find a vial containing the seed of a sueth-azoah. Do not attempt to germinate it unless the need is dire. I believe our family may have the talent, but over the centuries our magic has weakened, as it has with many, and we are no longer strong enough to bear the burden.

Never ask another magician about the sueth-azoah. They will not know, and those few that might still remember are not your friends. This is dangerous. I cannot emphasise that enough.

One of my books contains more information. I keep it and a few others hidden from your inquisitive little eyes and nimble fingers, for fear of scaring you away from our green friends. I'm sure it is around here somewhere. Take heed of the warnings within. 

There, I have written it this time without too many tear smudges. The last two attempts were completely illegible.

Goodbye, my perfect granddaughter. My sunshine. If I find your father somewhere out there in the beyond, be assured that I'll send him your love. Right after I tan his hide raw.

Nurture, find love, and chase joy.

Your doting gran-gran.

Susan had mulled over the message for months. It was a true mystery, for she'd never heard reference to any plant, magical or otherwise, named sueth-azoah.

She was busy making arrangements and studying at the time her grandmother passed. It took almost a year before she had the chance to decipher the hidden tomes she'd found stashed in Agatha's spare cauldron. Inside, she discovered some of the potentially darker aspects of their trade. Mimics, carnivorous plants in many shapes and sizes, effective corpse disposal, preparation and use of some of the most insidious poisons and organic acids in the magical world; there were instructions for some pretty nasty and bizarre stuff. Even then, no reference to the mysterious seed.

The convoluted text of the last two books was written in archaic elfish, and it had taken some serious dedication to learn even the basics. But Susan finally found it, and her grandmother's warning made sense. There was an implicit pact involved when you planted the sueth-azoah.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 11|
--------------------------------------------
Like her grandmother, she hid it away in a dark corner of the old house. It was easy to go on living your life and mostly forget about something like that after a few years. When a part-time nannying gig she'd taken to help through her last year of college turned into a full-time job, it fell even further into the background. Then her world was turned upside down, and care of the little dragon had been thrust upon her. Her life had never been the same.

"Miss Susan! What happened to you?!"

She looked up from her pained hobbling to see the boy running over to help her, wide-eyed with a face full of innocent concern.

"Don't worry about me, Vincent. I just slipped in this damn snow and hurt my ankle," the witch lied. "I'm afraid I don't have any new crystals today though. Could you ask Tamara to call me about it when you get back to her?"

"O... Okay," the lad said, hovering anxiously at her side and scowling reproachfully at the slushy snow blanketing Eddard's little carpark. "Here you can lean on my shoulder, at least as you go up the stairs."

"You're a sweetheart. Thank you."

With the help of her escort, Susan made it up the icy steps and unlocked the shop. Vincent followed her in. The perfect little gentleman, he made sure she was okay, sat her down in the kitchenette, and refused to leave her until Rowan showed up fifteen minutes later.

"I've just been fucking robbed, and some Chinese bitch broke my foot!" Susan replied to the old wizard's cocked, tufty eyebrow. The pain she'd been hiding from the youngster unleashed in her words, and it felt good.

To his credit, Rowan just grunted and shuffled off into his corner of the warehouse. A few speculative mutterings drifted to Susan's ears, and soon he returned with a basket containing the best of his extensive healing concoctions. He got down on his creaking knees and began gently removing her shoe.

"Oh, Susan. I'm sorry." He looked up at her, old eyes beginning to water at the sight of the blackening half-inch wide depression in the middle of her poor foot. The area was already swelling, a spreading bulge of angry purple against her pale skin. "I'll call Garril and get him down here right away. Have you told Chris?"

"No, and I'm not going to until those bastards are well on their way back home. I don't want him chasing after them and getting himself into trouble. It's not so bad, is it, Rowan? Patch me up for now and get me on my feet. We've got some crutches around here don't we?"

"Hmm. Yes, I think we do. I'll track some down for you, if not," he sighed, voice full of sympathy. "I can't believe someone would try this in broad daylight. What if some human called the police? I'll drop you back at the Compound so you can rest after Timothy is done asking questions."

"No, I've got work to do," Susan stubbornly waved off his concern, elevating her foot up onto the end of the sofa they kept in the kitchenette just inside the growing area of the warehouse. The aged healer gave her a disapproving scowl as he began dabbing on a reddish-brown liniment around the swelling. "Don't look at me like like that, Rowan. They threatened my family, stole our livelihood, and seemed to think that they'd be coming back for more. I know you've got some ditríff bulbs hidden in the back. I'm damn sure going to have a surprise or two of my own ready if they ever come back."

"Susan, no. Don't do anything rash, let Lady Narlakis deal with this. You'll get yourself hurt."

"As opposed to?" The witch asked bitterly, waving at her ruined foot for emphasis. "That's the only language these animals speak, Rowan. If they can get away with it, if you don't push back, they'll keep coming back for more."

What she didn't say was that she was deeply ashamed of herself, humiliated that she'd been so easily victimised and cowed. The terrible cocktail of roiling feelings slithered within her, black, poisonous snakes that set her teeth on edge. She wanted to scream, yet to weep and blubber; to be held close, and yet to spring into action and unleash the all violent retribution she could imagine. It was unravelling her.

Before long, a dark whisper welled up from her subconscious, tormenting her with insidious comparisons to Chris' other mates. Inevitably, she was found profoundly lacking, a pathetically impotent weakling. What would Petra have done in her place? Lillian? Probably beaten them all half to death, then robbed them instead.

Annabel had the right idea, she'd made something of herself with Chris' gifts. Susan might have raised her magical rating slightly, might be able to tackle some more challenging potions. So what? She'd been proud of that little achievement at the time too, how foolish. It was completely irrelevant in the face of the injustice she'd lived.

A frown that had nothing to do with her pain creased her brow as the witch realised something else. It was only going to get worse. The Revelation was coming, and there was a demon on the loose. She could not stand to be the weak link in their family.

Timothy Garril arrived promptly with two members of his security team, stirring Susan from her dark musings. He was very apologetic that something like this had happened under his watch. Susan gave him the descriptions of her assailants, recounting the whole scene in as much detail as she could remember.

"They definitely sound like one of the Syndicate's criminal families," the fire elemental nodded somberly. "That's the problem with them. They're mostly a legitimate co-operative, and you can happily do business with them for decades. But if things don't go their way, you'll eventually run across their thugs. Of course, the rest of the families will bend over backward to deny any sort of association with them, but everyone knows the deal."

Timothy promised that they would do what they could, but he suspected that the culprits were already headed out of the city. He surprised her by agreeing that she did the right thing by not running straight to Chris. The last thing anyone wanted was a dragon rampaging through the city, hell-bent on revenge. Chris was on thinning ice with the Synod after the series of incidents he'd been involved in. No need to hand House Lefayd any ammunition, let them worry about rebuilding their tattered reputation instead.

Susan spent the following hour or so stewing, sipping a bitter potion Rowan insisted was a miraculous aid to bone repair. He knew his craft, so Susan buckled under and drank the foul, metallic-tasting stuff. Eventually, she called her regular customers to apologise and explain that they would have to wait a little longer for their crystals. They were sympathetic, and several of them even vowed to petition Reyla to submit sanctions against the Syndicate. Empty punishments.

It surprised her when Rowan resurfaced from managing the storefront and reached inside a pocket of his stained robes to present her two grubby, earth-crusted lumps.

"Be careful with them," he cautioned. "I'll be the first to admit you've got a special gift with plants, Susan, but these fellows can be temperamental. I gave up on them after copping one too many needles and passing out for half a day, any more and I might not have woken up. Besides, they're not strictly legal anymore."

"Thank you, Rowan," she was touched, her voice thick with emotion. "I will be careful. I'm not planning any wild revenge, I'll leave something like that to Chris. I just... I felt so helpless. It's stupid, but I feel like if something like that happened again and I didn't make a better showing of myself, it would break me."

"Believe it or not, I know exactly how you feel. Though, I do try to make myself forget." The older gentleman sighed, wiping his hand over his time-worn face. "I was ah... When I was considerably younger, I was attacked by a vampire. He wasn't gentle, took pleasure from my fear and pain. I survived, but for a while there it was touch and go whether or not I wanted to. Anyway, I can understand the drive you feel to take precautions."

"Come here." Susan stood unsteadily and opened her arms for a hug, sinister thoughts pushed aside for a moment. It was the first time they'd shared that sort of embrace, but it wasn't awkward at all. "You're not so bad for an old grouch. Thank you, Rowan."

"Yeah yeah, get in line," Rowan chuckled with a little emotional gruffness in his throat. "I couldn't find the crutches but I've hired some, they should be dropped off soon."

They separated, smiling fondly at each other, both belatedly realising that they were becoming fast friends.

With several winces and a couple of groans, Susan finally managed to clomp her way over to her pavilion. Her mind was made up on a plan of action now. The more she thought about it, the more determined she became. That old bitch would get her comeuppance. 

Lillian stopped by, finding Susan industriously cleaning and polishing two small bell-jar enclosures. The invisible vampire gave her a hug after announcing herself and promised to help any way she could. She offered to walk with Susan to and from work, or deliver the filled crystals to Eddard's herself. Susan was genuinely grateful for the concern, but promptly lied through her teeth behind a mask of pain. She assured Lillian that she would be okay, that she mostly felt shaken up and a little stupid for not expecting something like this. It came easily, the social platitudes that would send the vampire back on her way.

"We'll tell Chris together this evening." Lillian squeezed her hand. "I think he'll understand your decision to keep him out of it eventually, he's going to be livid when he hears though. It will be better for everyone this way, he does have a busy schedule today, and this would really have tugged him in two directions. Call me if you need anything."

Susan almost broke at the mention of Chris' anger. Lillian had no idea. 

The vampire eventually left to go help with the security sweep around the Being district. The team were checking for any lingering Syndicate members, including those who had come for legitimate negotiation with Reyla. But they were also wary of getting caught up in a magical street brawl and risking exposure.

Rowan stopped by her fabric enclosure later, keeping his muttering mostly to himself as he saw her preparations to wake the dormant bulbs already well underway. The lingering, calculating look he gave her and the industrious preparations stirred an illogical paranoia, making her think she was about to be caught and her reckless plan exposed. He really looked like he was about to open his mouth and say object for a moment, but it passed and he began preparing to tend her foot again.

Out of a small bucket of hot ashes, he used a pair of wooden tongs to produce a piping-hot, rune-engraved, mottled river-stone. Four magical binding symbols had been painstakingly chipped into the striated white and grey surface, and filled with silver. That crafting process had probably happened several hundred years ago, but the sense of magic around the freshly charged artifact was palpable. 

It was a lesh stone, an ancient and somewhat inaccurate healing method. The engraved rock was part of an incomplete set that the canny apothecary had picked up at an estate sale in the 1960's. The attuned piece of polished metamorphite would slowly transmit the spell contained in the runes through the radiating heat.

Before the advances of modern science, they were once the favourites of Being soldiers, fighters, and those who were likely to get injured but had little skill or knowledge in the field of magical healing. Potions and spells had since grown in popularity due to their efficacy and swift action by comparison.

The four glittering symbols on this stone were specific to re-meshing bone. A tricky proposition at the best of times, it was one application where a lesh could be considered the equal of modern alchemical techniques due to the slow method of action. Rowan had been warming the old thing all morning using a little wood-burning braiser he kept in his potion laboratory. Now he carefully swaddled it in several layers of moist sacking they kept for the nursery and gently wrapped it in place on top of Susan's foot. Lesh stones were made to absorb and release the heat of the fire unnaturally slowly, so while it might become uncomfortably hot, it wouldn't burn.

Susan sighed as he left, putting a temporary halt to the cage fight between rage and fear that rattled jarringly around inside her skull. It wasn't that that she didn't appreciate his effort, or Lillian's visit, or her client's sympathy over the stolen crystals. There was work to be done, and she had a limited timeframe.

The anger was a fake sort of resolve, goading her to act, to do something, anything. Her lips pulled back in a silent, impotent snarl, revealing teeth pressed painfully tight against each other. Besides, she was flush with dragon-magic, wasn't she? She could do this. But once his arms wrapped around her, or she even caught sight of him, Susan knew it would vanish, evaporate into thin air as she became that helpless, hopeless wreck from the snowy street once more.

"WRR... WRR... RRRRROOOOOOAAAAA! I AM THE FIRE, I AM THE NIGHT! BURN, BURN!"

Chris winced as his sensitive ears were violated by the crashing drum-beat and screaming lyrics issuing from Yurt's boombox. With a wry chuckle, he put the five-gallon buckets of pre-mixed tiling grout he was carrying down on the drop-cloth pathway.

The earmuffs around his neck were quickly employed, protecting him from the worst of the goblin's continuous, death-spewing racket. He took a moment to admire the light tones of the eucalyptus flooring underneath his feet, as it peeked out from under the protective cloth pathway into the conjoined dining and living room. The cost of the imported timber had forced him to sell off more of his dragon gold to Reyla, but he didn't feel so apprehensive about that these days. It looked lovely in contrast to the soft-white plaster and reddish stone of the walls. Furnishing the huge area, and the rest of the house for that matter was going to be a costly ordeal too. However, he wanted to leave those choices up to his ladies. That was the least he could do after keeping them in the dark for so long on the house's design.

Stephen's head popped up above the kitchen bench where he was installing a set of drawers. The werebison shared a sympathetic shake of the head about the clamorous music. He had bright orange foam plugs sticking out of his own ears.

Chris picked his load back up and continued down the stained, fabric roadway into the yawning breach of death metal, the main bathroom. It was amusing to him that his return to the construction team led straight back to his original roles of pack-mule and magical juice-box, but he didn't mind. One could hardly complain after seeing the goblin brothers in action.

He paused in the doorway, watching their frenzied work for a moment. Above, on the scaffold trolley, Belthelas was using a grooved trowel to apply a thin layer of white grout to a section of wall in front of Yurt's nimble tile laying. Slapping on self-spacing arrays of the light grey, inch-wide tiles, Yurt was making sure his brother was hard pressed to keep up with his demand for more tiles and prepared wall space.

They'd been working their way clockwise around the room from bottom to top since before dawn. The plastered ceiling was now only a few rotations and extension of the trolley's legs away.

Of course, there was magical cheating aplenty. Chris' refilling of their personal crystals as well as the beautiful geode-well saw to that. Yurt didn't have to waste time painstakingly settling, levelling, and spacing. He merely waved a stubby little wand in his white-splattered hands, and the tiles snapped to attention like well-disciplined soldiers.

Belthelas hurriedly kicked an empty tile box down into the enormous pile of discarded packaging and buckets that was accumulating on the covered floor. The falling cardboard jostled the fiendishly decorated sound system as it blared profanity. Unfortunately, it didn't manage to hit anything vital. The damn thing had horns and was painted to look like the head of some insectoid monstrosity, gaping maw and all.

Belthelas used his pointed nails to slice open another box of tiles and slammed half the contents down on Yurt's waist high working tray. Noticing Chris, the goblin scowled at his idleness and beckoned him over to pass up the two heavy pails onto their raised platform.

"Need me to move you?" Chris teased, his hands on the aluminium framework of their crowded little construction chariot. 

"Not after last time, honcho. I value me f'ing tusks in me skull thank you very much," Belthelas chortled, his voice almost drowned under the music and Chris' hearing protection. "Just keep the supplies coming down from upstairs, big fella. We're on a roll here."

Chris couldn't help giving the trolley a playful shake, sending it rocking slightly as the goblin turned back to his task. Belthelas growled and quickly retaliated by launching a glob of grout, which splattered with unerring accuracy, dead centre in the crotch of Chris' tatty jeans. It wasn't more than a light, glancing blow, but it brought the dragon up short with a queasy shudder.

"Hey! Not the jewels," Chris pointed up at the simpering goblin who appeared to be acting out some sort of ridiculous victory jig.

"Back to work with ya," Belthelas chortled from his perch. "I've got plenty of ammunition up here."

Chris' eyes narrowed, already plotting his revenge as he turned and began trying to scrape the sour-cream-like substance off his groin. It was going to leave a rather embarrassing stain. That was when he noticed Gruff, and the decorative changes he'd started on the opposite wall.

The third brother was up on a ladder, doing something to the delicately mottled grey tiles. In his wake, a thin band of them were left glimmering and golden, about three-quarters of the way up the wall. There were going to be three such ribbons Chris realised as he caught a glimpse of the other two through the ladder's rungs. Purple near the floor, cream halfway up the wall, and gold on top. The goblins were nothing if not flattering to his dragon's ego.

"Gruff? I appreciate the colour scheme, I really do, but how the hell are you doing that?" he asked, negotiating the debris on his way over for a closer look.

"Simple," the little artisan replied, with a toothy smile. He turned to reveal his own stumpy, gnarled, rod of wood in one hand and a small nugget of gold in the other. "S'just thin leaf. Gold doesn't take much convincing. Telling a piece of granite to turn purple, that's a bit more tricky. We didn't want to be cheating pricks and resort to paint though. Not in the harem's spa."

Chris was just starting to shake his head in amusement at Gruff's apt naming of the luxurious bathing room when his phone began vibrating angrily in his pocket. As he pulled the device free, the time displayed on the screen as well as the caller's ID set his heart to panicked thumping. He sprinted from the room with a backward wave at the goblins, running to escape their deafening music so he could answer it.

"Got to go, Stephen. Sorry!" he shouted an apology as he raced by and flung his earmuffs on the kitchen bench. "Back this afternoon!"

"Slacker!" the werebison called after him playfully.

"Honey, I'm on the way now," Chris finally answered the call as he leapt up the stairs to the warehouse floor three at a time. "I got carried away and lost track of time."

"Do you know what I'm looking at right now, Chris?" Petra's tone seemed cordial enough, but he thought he could detect a hint of winter's breath lurking beneath. "Dr Chang is warming up his dastardly instruments, and I'm strapped open for his inspection. My poor hooha is defenceless! Meanwhile Claire and I cling to each other for support, absent the father of our children, who's off cavorting with goblins."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 12|
--------------------------------------------
"I know, I'm really sorry. Let me just get my spare pair of clothes and I'll be there in a moment. Don't start without me!"

Chris burst up out of the darkness like a hungry bat from a cave, skidding to a halt on the dusty floor to rummage frantically in his backpack. He ignored his packed lunch, digging deeper to pull out a fresh t-shirt. The winter chill quickly bit at his sweat-damp skin as he stripped off the tattered work shirt he wore and flung it aside. For a moment he considered putting on his spare jeans, but he dared not keep Petra waiting one second longer than necessary. Slipping his woollen jumper over his elbow, the dragon took a calming breath and reached into the Ether.

His abrupt appearance in Dr Chang's waiting room caused a series of disapproving clucks from a pair of old crones. Dressed in some sort of floof-skirted getup from a bygone century, Chris only spared them a brief glance. His nose lead him through the hospital-style doors and down the hallway toward his mates.

"There's daddy!" Claire was in his arms as soon as he knocked and opened the door to the examination room. Her lush, red locks tickled his nose as they embraced. "I'm really glad you made it."

Chris could feel her tenseness, churning anxiety winding her tight inside. Once again, he kicked himself for being late. 

"Sorry, honey. I intend to make it up to you, my ruby goddess," he murmured directly in her ear, stroking up and down her spine for a moment as he buried his nose in her scalp and took in the faint strawberry notes of her scent. 

Over her head, Harold Chang was scowling at him behind a surgical mask, glasses, and disposable gloves. He even had a small headlamp on as he rounded on the disturbance, leaving Petra's creamy legs spread and exposed in a pair of stirrups. In the doctor's hand, a condom covered, corded wand waved menacingly toward the blonde's privates. No wonder Claire was anxious, he thought.

"Ahh, nice of you to join us, Chris. If we're all finally here, I'll begin," the no-nonsense doctor delivered deadpan before turning to his assisting nurse. "Ruth, turn the ultrasound around a little, so Ms Godran can see our progress, would you please?"

The brown-haired water elemental started out of a small, dragon-induced swoon to comply. Chris and Claire went to Petra's side, eager for their first peek at the treasured new life thriving in her womb. Chris took the older dragoness' hand and squeezed apologetically as a shiver ran up her body in time with the doctor's careful intrusion.

"What does it feel like, Mom?" the redhead whispered.

"It's fine, dear," Petra assured as she focused on the dark, indistinct image on the ultrasound. "Just a little strange pressure and a bit of a chill... Oh look, there he is!"

Petra felt the hold on her hand increase to a death grip, and she tore her eyes away from the grainy picture on the machine's display. Her mate was staring wide-eyed, nostrils flared, and his barrel chest heaving with excited breath. The dragoness' heart melted for him all over again, so affected by even a glimpse of their child. A happy smile grew on her lips, and she endured his tight embrace, stroking the back of his trembling hand with her thumb.

"Is it... healthy?" her daughter asked tremulously.

"Of course he is," Petra snorted up at her daughter, who appeared to be clinging to their mate as tightly as he was clinging to her. They were young and going through this for the first time. She thought back to her own experience with Claire, but things were a lot different back then. Beings didn't have access to this modern medical equipment for starters, no one did. These sorts of checkups had been done by magic back then, and it was by feel and tradition rather than scientific method.

"Our baby," Chris crooned absently, operating in a trancelike state as he laid a huge, still dirty hand on Petra's gown-covered, barely-there bulge. His eyes couldn't leave the fluctuating image of the vaguely human-shaped lump, even after belatedly realising that he'd almost squeezed Petra's hand off.

"Yes, yes, it's all very wonderful," the doctor assured as he gently extracted the ultrasound wand and the display went dark. "But we also need to perform a topical scan, and then we'll still have Claire to do, so hands off. Legs out of the stirrups please Petra, and expose your stomach."

"Did we get pictures?" Chris suddenly asked as Petra shuffled around and the doctor prepared the linear transducer.

"I'll review the footage and send the best to you later," the nurse reassured him.

"I can't wait to see inside my little bulge," Claire almost bounced with anticipation now, her nerves forgotten. The young dragoness tiptoed up against her mate and planted a warm, fleeting kiss at the side of his mouth. "Dr Chang is it really going to be a boy, or is Mom just guessing?"

"It's probably a little too early to tell by conventional methods unless we get lucky," he admitted as he adorned Petra's lower belly with a thick bead of cold, bluish gel. "If you both agree, I'd like to make a brief magical examination of the pregnancies when we're done with the ultrasound. I should be able to confirm sex as well as give you complete peace of mind about the safety and progress of development. I've found that combined with the ultrasound, I can usually come up with some very accurate delivery dates."

"Of course, Harold. Thank you," Petra nodded her consent before everyone was once again swept up in watching the ultrasound display and the dark, soft shapes blurrily recognisable as a brand new human.

"How's your morning sickness?" Harold asked almost conversationally as he dragged the transducer across Petra's tummy for another view.

"I'm absolutely fine," the dragoness shrugged. "I had a touch a few weeks back, but it's been giving Claire a hard time some days."

"You didn't tell me?" Chris looked to his young mate, feeling somehow betrayed that Claire had kept her suffering to herself.

"And what were you going to do about it, huh?" the redhead reached up and playfully booped his nose. "There was no point getting you upset about a little nausea. Besides, it's not so bad if I snack all day."

"There are a number of factors associated," Ruth agreed, happy to advise after several of her own experiences. "First pregnancies are often the most difficult, but for me, the girls really brought out the strange smells and the queasy stomach. My husband at the time insisted on cooking so I didn't have to struggle with it, which was very endearing."

"Well I've got Annabel, and she's amazing," Claire gushed. "I get Immi showing up at all hours with little treats if they've made something and I don't have to even look at the kitchen."

"How do I not know about this?" Chris complained. "I feel like a lug."

"You help us in other ways," Petra playfully batted her eyes up at him as the gel was spread further and further on her tummy. The doctor must really be having a comprehensive look. "And I don't mean foot rubs."

"How? All I'm doing is... oh."

Ruth stifled a giggle as he blushed. Dr Harold harrumphed softly.

"Doofus," Claire bumped her forehead into his meaty shoulder, holding him close for a moment to savour his scent. She absolutely loved how he smelled after working, her body associating the cinnamon-flavoured musk of his drying sweat very strongly with sex.

"Ahem, yes. Well what about your nesting instinct, how quickly is it developing?" Harold changed the subject.

"Ha!" Claire laughed.

"Don't you dare, young lady!" Petra warned.

"Mom sleepwalked into my room the other night and started stealing my pillows and bedding right out from under me," the redhead bubbled, hiding behind Chris as her mother ineffectually tried to swat at her from the examination table. "I followed her back into her room, and she'd pulled the mattress off the bed and shoved it in the corner to make some sort of cocoon out of towels, pillows, and anything soft she could get a hold of. It was so funny I took a few pictures when she finally curled up."

"I'm so embarrassed," Petra covered her eyes with a hand as her daughter extracted her phone to show Chris. "With Claire, I didn't really start until around month seven when I was really cow-like. I'm not getting any urges during the day yet, I swear!"

"It's quite natural in your species, I'm told," the doctor consoled. "You should start planning though. Are you going to take time off work to support your mates, Chris?"

Claire and Petra went googly-eyed as he puffed up like a tundra grouse for his bold proclamation.

"I'll be there to wait on them hand and foot. In fact, there are already some preparations completed in our new home."

"Really?" Petra asked hopefully. "What?"

"It's a surprise, and I can't take the credit, but I think you're going to love it. Wait, do you think you two can split a nest? I hadn't thought of that."

The dragoness shared a look with each other before turning back to him and nodding, beaming radiant smiles. Petra reached up for a hug, which he was happy to carefully and somewhat awkwardly provide around the slightly peeved Dr Chang.

"I do hope you're well prepared, Sire," she murmured huskily in his ear. "I'm insatiable when I nest."

He didn't get a chance to reply.

"A perfectly healthy fetus," the doctor-wizard announced. "Look at the screen here, lovebirds. Quite large for this early stage of development but nothing to be concerned about."

Chris watched in awe as Harold made a small adjustment in the position of his handheld device and the perfect silhouette of his developing child resolved into clarity. All of a sudden he could easily make out budding arms and legs, a bulging little belly, and a noggin that would put a Roswell alien to shame. It felt like he was falling endlessly down a tunnel as his dragon mind obsessed around and around in a short circuit of paternal pride.

He could have stood there staring for hours at the frozen screen, but it wasn't long until Ruth was wiping up the impedance-matching gel and Claire was fearlessly climbing onto the examination table to replace her mother.

The stirrups and wand required for her transvaginal ultrasound weren't really that uncomfortable it turned out. Embarrassment had been her main hang up, but she found it easier to ignore after seeing how stoically her mother had disregarded the intrusion. Besides, she really wanted to see Chris' enthusiastic reaction for their own child.

Dr Chang's surprised grunt was their only indication that something was amiss.

Their cries for clarification of such a loaded sound went unanswered as the doctor held up a warning finger and concentrated on finding the correct orientation for the wand inside Claire. The three dragons watched tensely as first one, and then a second patch of fuzzy darkness resolved themselves on the screen into the shape of two tiny skulls.

"Twins?!" Petra gasped, giving voice to everyone's shock and surprise.

"But... I don't... how?" Claire turned to her mom for reassurance. Her mind raced simultaneously back through memory to search for some overlooked indication. It was overwhelming, her thoughts suddenly inverting, launching into the future to construct new imaginings of her life under the demanding regime of two babes. She wasn't ready for this.

Behind them, Chris groped blindly for a nearby chair and sat himself down with a thump.

"That's a good question, Claire-bear but we'll work it out," Petra reassured her daughter as they watched Dr Chang do his work. Beside him, Ruth was almost quivering with nervous excitement.

"I only remember one burst of magic at conception," the young mother worried. "They'll both be dragons, won't they?"

"I'm sure they will. Don't work yourself up, darling. Hey! I can't believe you went and upstaged me like this!"

"Intact placenta," the doctor muttered to himself under his breath as he watched the ultrasound like a hawk. "Indications of complete chorion. It could be... separate amniotic... magic might... but does that mean they're..."

"Doctor, please!" Chris couldn't handle the suspense.

"Huh? Oh, give me a minute," Harold Chang slowly removed the probe and handed it off to Ruth for sanitation. He stripped off his gloves and appeared to stare down into Claire's womanhood speculatively for a moment before helping her close her legs and indicating she should lie back on the examination table. Finally, he reached inside his lab coat, down into his blazer pocket to produce a thin, well polished, cedar wand. "May I?"

"Uh huh," Claire nodded nervously, glancing up to Petra.

The doctor was extremely cautious, taking as much time as necessary with his incantation. His wand tip traced slow circles above the young dragoness' womb as he murmured out the framework for his small, gently questing spell. His small subjects were incredibly delicate, surrounded in a palpable bubble of churning, potent magic. The last thing he needed was to trigger any sort of instinctual defensive magic from Claire. He might not survive. Still, that would be preferable to, heaven forbid, somehow damaging the tiny dragon babes with a hastily constructed spell.

At the last moment, he realised that he might be better served to look at Petra's child first to establish some sort of baseline for comparison. He was in uncharted territory after all. Dragon pregnancies were rare enough these days that a doctor in the Being community could be in practice for several lifetimes and still never preside over one. The claim of a single conception event triggered his concern though. Dragon twins were utterly unheard of, and these two presented a biology which obscured the nature of their origin quite effectively.

With Petra's permission, Harold began the process again, guiding his spell painstakingly down through the chaotic sea of potent magic surrounding her child. The dragoness stood patiently for him, indulging his metaphysical intrusion through layer upon layer of pulsing energy. His mind boggled at the sheer quantity of the stuff. These women were abuzz with magic, and he knew exactly where the glut was coming from. A thin sweat of concentration rose on his brow as he finally approached what he hoped was the last protective layer surrounding her engorged uterus.

There was pressure within, like a bottle of champagne. It felt like he was gently tapping at the cork and it scared him a little. He steeled himself and slipped a sliver of his awareness inside for the gentlest of inspections.

Dazzling, pure radiance hit him square between the eyeballs like a celestial sledgehammer. It was simple, blunt-force magic. An instinctual query from warm, contented pre-thoughts backed up by godlike magical force. 

With his magical sensitivity fully opened, Harold was instantly blinded. He caught only a fleeting glimpse of the fetus before his mind fled the overwhelming sensation, slamming up its own mental barriers as he desperately retreated back into his own body. His wand flew up out of his fingers, rebounding off the stark ceiling before clattering noisily to the floor.

Harold slumped back in his chair, panting, shaking. His magical senses were going haywire, caught rapidly fluctuating between rebelling and rejoicing. His whole body felt like a struck gong, resonating away the discordant power in an uncontrollable, but not entirely unpleasant note. He'd felt something like that only once before.

"You..." the wizard pointed an unsteady, accusatory finger at the culprit. He managed only a few more mumbled words before his vision began to fade at the edges, his blood pressure reaching a temporary but critical low. "I should... have guessed..."

"Harold. Harold! Dr Chang, wake up!"

The voice sounded far away, but a cool sensation on his forehead was rapidly drawing him back from senseless nothing. With a start and a tired groan, Harold was back in the world of the living. He found himself laid out on one of his own examination tables, a headache battering at the inside of his poor skull.

Carefully, he opened his eyes and found four concerned faces staring down at him. They barely let him sit up for a drink of chilled water before the demands for answers resumed. He supposed he didn't blame them.

"Your progeny appear to share your affinity for unrestrained magic, even from within the womb," he looked the soon-to-be-father in the eye as he laid it out straight. "Your son is likely well on the way to developing a class one status, less than three months into his gestation."

"But... wait, my son?"

"Yes. We had a rather personal interaction on the magical level. I wasn't prepared for his sort of overflowing power, not with my senses so fine tuned. Good thing he's a happy little bug in a rug, or you could be talking to a mindless, burnt out husk of a doctor."

Silence settled over his audience as that news was absorbed. Harold was thankful for the opportunity to close his eyes and just enjoy sipping at his water in peace for a moment.

"You're going to be big and strong, just like your Da," Petra hummed, manicured fingers tracing proudly back and forth over her abdomen.

Harold chuckled at the Dragoness' clucking. No one had yet thought through the ramifications of unleashing multiple such Beings as Chris on the world. They were headed for a fundamental shift, even without the Revelation. What if his children could pass it on, too? Shit, what about the vampire's kid? Was he going to have to preside over that ticking womb-bomb? With a shudder, he realised he still had one more thing to do before he could retreat to his office for a much-deserved nap.

As the happy dragons coalesced into a loving embrace, they didn't notice the doctor retrieve his wand from the linoleum floor. Their hug was interrupted when he explained the need to delve back into the exploratory spell he'd already woven around Claire's twins.

Harold was braced against the magical onslaught this time. He managed a good few seconds of vital observation before he was forced to slink away from the remarkable pair of Beings. Their emissions were slightly weaker than their half-brother's, but they were also much smaller. Where the twin girls' biological presentation had left him wondering, their unified magical emanation did not. Exhausted though he was, he managed a weak smile for their anxious, russet-haired mother.

"You're to be the proud mother of identical twin girls. Sometime in the first few days of your pregnancy, while your embryo was made up of just sixteen cells or less, something went wrong in the cleavage, and it separated into two distinct, but genetically homogeneous embryos."

"I don't care about the textbook explanation right now, doctor," Claire interrupted as it looked like he was going to continue. "Are they going to be okay? I remember reading something about identical twins having a high chance of complications during pregnancy."

"That's unfortunately true, the risks to both you and the babies are not insignificant. However, as I was about to say, because the twinning event happened so early in the process, each of them have their own placenta and amniotic sacs rather than sharing. By ultrasound, they essentially look like normal twins, but when I got a glimpse of them by magic, it was obvious they were cut from the same cloth so to speak. This type of pregnancy is by far the safest in the scale that goes all the way up to conjoining, so that's excellent news."

"Thank God," Chris murmured, hugging Claire tight as they patiently listened to the doctor's explanation.

"We're not out of the woods by any stretch," cautioned Harold, holding up a hand to stifle a yawn before he continued. "I'll need to keep a close eye on their development and especially their presentation before birth. I should also warn you that we may have to consult a human specialist about the pregnancy. Twins like this are often born underdeveloped and can require months of intensive care. Just look at the size difference between an individual twin and Petra's single pregnancy at essentially the same stage, and you'll see what I mean."

--------------------------------------------
"We'll be fine," Chris whispered into the shell of Claire's ear as he sensed the tension mounting inside her. "They'll be perfect, I just know it. How could they not with parents like us?"

Claire dropped the doctor's gaze, unable to contain the small smile growing on her lips as Chris began diverting her gathering worry with playful nibbles against her neck. She couldn't believe how brazen he was in front of Dr Chang and his nurse, but it was working, and she loved him for it.

"Ahh, I see you two are becoming distracted. Nevermind, I need a break myself after all that. Claire, I'll arrange a one on one visit in a few weeks once I've had time to do a bit more research myself. On that note, I think I'll go collapse for a bit. Congratulations, everyone."

"Thank you, Dr Chang. I really mean it," Chris said sheepishly as the man turned to leave. "If there's anything I..."

"Don't worry about it, Chris. It's my job."

Harold made drunkenly for his office, he was exhausted. Behind him, someone let out a happy squeal, and he could hear excited plans for breaking the joyous news being thrown around for discussion.

He almost made it to his receptionist to cancel a few non-urgent appointments that afternoon before he was accosted by the damn woman once again. She was a tenacious one, he'd give her that. Brilliant too, if he was feeling generous. Brilliant, but still somehow twisted. Right now he didn't have the fortitude to deal with another of her question sessions, requests for equipment, or solicitous urgings for samples from his patients.

"Dr Mayer, look... I'm sorry, but I'm exhausted and don't have the willpower for you right now," he forestalled. Her desire, whatever it was, never had a chance to be voiced. Then a wicked little opportunity for payback sprouted in his tired brain and he turned around and beckoned the scientist to follow him back the way he came. "You know what? I do have something you'll be interested in, but you're going to owe me big time for this one. I'm talking at least a month or two without going complaining to Lady Narlakis that I'm not providing you with adequate magical support."

Ruth and the dragons were still excitedly reliving the unexpected news when he paused in the doorway with the lean, greying scientist in tow. Harold couldn't help noticing the gleam that seemed to enter his unsavoury colleague's eyes as she saw who was there. Her already excellent posture notched up one final level to her parade-ground best at the sight of the dragon family.

"On second thought. Chris, you remember Dr Mayer?" Harold started before they noticed his return. "She's been bugging me for days to somehow get you into the MRI. So, as a personal favour for going above and beyond, please lend her a little of your time for the sake of my well-deserved nap."

"But I..." Chris started to protest.

"Cool, thanks," Harold was surprised by his own casual confidence as he turned to Dr Mayer beside him and handed her his access card. Perhaps he was beyond caring in his exhausted state. "You kids have fun now, but bring it back with a full tank. So help you if she's dinged-up."

***

The first order of business was to husk the ditríff. In the familiar, cozy den of her indoor pavilion, Susan worked slowly, carefully to revitalise her dangerous little charges. They took a brief soak in warm water, loosening the outer skin layers of their tulip-like bulbs. Donning a pair of thick leather gloves and safety glasses to protect herself from any acidic mishaps, the witch spent a few minutes gently abrading with an old toothbrush. Dirt and oniony skin layers came loose, exposing the first hint of greenish flesh beneath.

When she lifted them up to the light for a better look, their tiny white roots were already starting to wriggle enthusiastically in response to the pampering.

There was an enclosure for each, into which she placed a bed of moistened sphagnum. A generous sprinkling of crushed quartz crystal came next, a ready source of magical energy to encourage their sprouting. With each bulb nestled securely, she spritzed liberally with a nutrient solution. On went the foot-high bell-jar containers, clamped firmly in place.

The little terraria were placed on a heated pad underneath a wholesome, powerful light source. There were air valves on top of the glass domes, which she opened just a crack so that they could breathe. Under the stimulus of warmth and light, the hazardous occupants should be set to gradually awaken from dormancy over the next few days.

Susan stood for long moments just watching the quiescent ditríff, distracting herself from the heavy burden of her imminent decision. There could be no more procrastinating.

The ball of dark wax rested ominously behind her on the spill-stained potions workbench, retrieved from a long-sealed, hidden compartment in the bottom of one of her chests. Now, exposed to the light of day for the first time in over a decade, it seemed to loom ominously at the edge of her magical scenes.

Susan's hands came sternly to her full hips as she turned to face the thing, a determined scowl on her pretty brow. Perhaps her imagination was running wild, but surrounded by glassware and bottles of dried ingredients, it both thrilled and terrified her. 

She almost lost her nerve, but the bowl of water was already starting to steam above her bunsen burner, its blue flame flickering merrily. That heat was echoed in the uncomfortable warmth of the lesh stone, and in the throbbing pain of her ruined foot as tiny slivers of fragmented bone slowly teased themselves back together. With an angry huff, the dark-haired witch took up her colander and scooped the wax ball quickly into the steaming water bath. It was done.

Intent blue eyes didn't leave the slowly rolling, bobbing orb for a moment. Black wax began melting quickly under a gentle simmer. It sloughed away, liquifying to form dark bubbles on the surface, merging ever larger. Soon enough, a discrete layer of the oily stuff lay atop the steaming water. With gentle motions, Susan used the colander to slowly dunk the shrinking ball, watching for the first hint of the promised vial at its core.

A quiet clink of glass on stainless steel finally announced that her vigil was over. Careful of scalding her fingers, Susan transferred it back to her workbench and pried the remaining softened wax open, revealing a sigil-engraved capsule. The inch-long, sharp-ended magical prison was made entirely of glass. Two tiny, exquisitely crafted cones of transparent silica fused perfectly together at their bases by magic. The pea-sized inmate waited placidly inside, oblivious that its lengthy incarceration was about to come to an abrupt end.

Susan recognised her grandmother's hand in the runes for insulation, stasis, and magical nullification etched on the curved surface. It was a primitive, yet effective magical construct. Simple was often best with runes, unless you were a true expert in that particular arcane art. Agatha's work stuck to that principle, keeping nosy spells out, and interminably containing what rested inside. The dark wax made sense to her now, blocking light as the spell and glass could not.

The dark green, almost greyish resident didn't seem intrinsically dangerous. Susan held the magical repository by its ends between finger and thumb for a closer look. Its surface had an intricately gnarled, almost woody appearance. Small grooves and crevices flowed, merged, and subsumed around and around as if the little sphere were in fact made of a highly compressed network of tough filaments coiled inward on themselves. The vivid sketches of the sueth-azoah's victims depicted in that gruesome elfin book made the witch suspect that this might, in fact, be the case. Perhaps the true kernel lay somewhere within the protective fibres. Or maybe the filaments themselves were the vegetative germ of the ancient jungle creeper. She couldn't know, as there had been no depiction of a seed in that obscure text, only sketchings of...

Susan shuddered and closed her eyes, fighting to banish the image that sprung into her mind's eye. It wasn't pretty to imagine your own desiccated corpse. Nor a twisting, arthritic stem of knotty, interweaving vines reaching slowly skyward from the rictus of a screaming mouth to produce a single, delicate white flower. Anger fuelled her resolve and she refused to acknowledge that as her fate. Not with Chris' magic flowing strong in her veins.

The delicate vial shattered with a satisfying tinkle on her first attempt, the dry sueth-azoah seed rolling a little way across the bench before it came to a reluctant halt against a beaker. Apprehension and anticipation put her on the verge of hyperventilating now as she took off her lab coat and safety glasses.

Lacking a better tool for the job, she took up one of the longer slivers of glass. Pausing only for one final instant of fearful reluctance, Susan turned off her bunsen burner, and plucked the dark seed up, hobbling over to her wicker sofa.

With her foot in such a state, it was a relief to finally lay out the meagre tools for her amateur operation and lay down on the soft cushions. Beside her on the coffee table lay a small hand mirror from her purse, the sharp sliver of glass, two large quartz crystals brimming with dragon-tinged energy, and finally the knotty little sueth-azoah.

It was awkward lying on her front, but after undoing a few buttons on her shirt and pulling it down over her shoulders, she eventually arranged the mirror in one hand to satisfying effect. With her head turned to the side, cheek pressed into the couch's fabric, she could catch a view in the mirror as her other hand probed gently at the base of her neck.

Susan felt downward across a few bumps of her vertebrae and onto her upper back. Her fingers pressing into the soft depressions on either side, approximating the diagram she remembered from that accursed text. There didn't seem to be much padding above the ridge of bone, she'd definitely lost a little weight recently. Chris' attention and the often strenuous exertions he demanded of her seemed to be whipping her metabolism into overdrive.

She spared him one final apologetic thought as the glass bit sharply, slicing a shallow gash through pale skin, unleashing a gentle trickle of red. This was for herself, not him, she rationalised. With shaking, bloody fingertips, the witch dropped the improvised scalpel and reached for the seed. Quickly now, for the eager thing began to writhe in her trembling grip at the first touch of vital lifeblood. Susan reached to the base of her neck and settled the seed into the jagged incision, holding it gently in place.

Within moments, a crawling, tugging sensation spread across the area. Susan watched in the small mirror's reflection as the greenish-grey seed seemed to gather her spilt blood unnaturally around itself. It visibly seethed now, writhing like a den of winter-snakes, uncoiling and slithering slowly into the warmth of her flesh. The sensation intensified, first making her want to scratch at the area. Then, as the infant plant began to truly insinuate its thirsty tendrils into her tissue, it clutched painfully at her magic and drank.

Her gasp of pain and shock was cut short the instant one of its tiny hyphae-like roots infiltrated her spinal column. An involuntary seizure of spasming muscles preceded the wave of paralysis that flowed down her body as the greedy thing tapped her like a well and sucked hungrily. Her panic rose as she realised she could no longer move below the seed's intrusion. Her breath was coming fast, the pain in her foot forgotten, paling in comparison to the ripping apart, the devouring of her very magical essence. It was all a terrible mistake, she realised too late. The book had never mentioned anything about this!

In her final moments, Susan had the foresight to snatch up the crystals, transferring one to each hand as the alien presence began spreading upward too. She could still feel every ounce of pain as the creeper started spreading its woody tendrils more boldly through her body, following some ancient genetic blueprint to seek out pockets of magic.

The panicked witch was soon powerless to do anything but lie there and hyperventilate ineffectually as it took control. Mind scrambling at the prison of an unresponsive body, Susan could only voice a plaintive gurgle of terrified protest. The itching, wriggling shoots burrowed upward under her skin. Uncaring, and intent on the mass of fear-taxed neurons it could sense nearby, the sueth-azoah sought its host's brain. Behind fluttering eyelids, Susan's consciousness rebelled as her magic was consumed, converted in its entirety to fuel the rapid growth.

An alien presence pushed at the back of her mind. It was undeniable, unresistable. Her thoughts struggled against it, but it entered her in the slow, inevitable way a tree's roots crack pavement.

The witch's sanity retreated, fleeing sentient thought in a terminal effort to preserve itself. In her final moment, Susan got a glimpse of the creature that consumed her.

It was old, so old. Cool and placid as it woke from long, lightless slumber in juxtapose to her terrified mental scrabbling. And it was happy, content to spread its roots in fresh, fertile new soil. Then, nothing.

The sueh-azoah eventually spread it hungry rootlets to every corner of the magic-rich host. The mesh of fibres was already starting to differentiate, thickening into tougher bundles around the contours of bone, branching into intricate sheaths to wrap around delicate blood vessels and nerves. It threaded outward into soft tissue, ever thinning and refining until its microscopic root hairs worked their way up through pores. It finally breathed air, exchanging gasses after what felt like an eternity of dark nothingness.

Wherever it went, through bundles of muscle, through delicate organ, and the calcified lattice of bone, the sueth-azoah did its best to contour and integrate to the existing structure. It tasted as it went, sampling complex biochemistry and adjusting its own patterns to match.

Magic greeted its roots wherever they roamed. Its slowly stirring, instinctive memory could not recall a time when its parched wood was so thoroughly wetted with the stuff of creation. It had a wild, primal taste to it too, excellent nourishment. A delicious, yet terrifying flavour of power that did not belong entirely to the empathic host.

The primitive patterns of plant-thought took on a warmer tone of satisfaction. Near glutted and content in the instinctive knowledge that this would be a fruitful joining, it slowed its headlong grab for energy. It had more than enough now to reform its seed if the living vessel could not survive.

Slowly, as it meshed with its new host, the sueth-azoah became aware of its surroundings. More specifically, it felt the brimming power of yet two more potent sources of magic clutched in its fingers. Dark tendrils ruptured outward from pale skin, enmeshing the two crystals in a more secure embrace, supping slowly. It began to sense more magic of various quality and origin nearby, but it had more than enough for now. The witch had wisely provided enough for a complete germination, there was no need to start digesting her tissues. Perhaps there was even enough to last for a whole season, if they conserved their magic.

But where was the sun? It longed to feel that precious warmth after so long in the dark, to bask and absorb that delicious radiance. That was all that was required now, all that held back what promised to be a most complete, wonderful joining.

With halting, jerky motions and glazed eyes, Susan Baryst's 5'6" form picked itself up of the sofa and shambled haltingly out of her little pavilion.

The sueth-azoah became aware of the damaged limb-flesh as the host's nerves fired protests of pain. The generous host was damaged, possibly in danger. Its slow thoughts quickened in defensive anger, sweeping the witch's head left and right. It was ill-suited to interpret the complexity of nerve impulses on its own. The bright scene before it was confusing, moist air, a host of pollen on the warm, slowly circulating breeze, and verdant, jungle-like growth under rows and rows of... false suns.

The thing stared uncomprehendingly, awed by the magnitude of the magical feat for long minutes. The sun must have set and risen many, many times for such a strange spell to be devised. It could feel the nourishing warmth radiating onto its skin, but the sueth-azoah was mistrustful. The healthy growth of so many magical brethren spoke to the potency of this strange magic, perhaps that was where the witch got her power? But it was not fooled. This was no true sunlight, and it would not do for the joining. It must continue the search, fearful now that perhaps something had happened to the daylight-god. For why else would the hosts create such a complex, wasteful spell if the sun's rays had not abandoned them.

With ease, the damaged host-flesh was surrounded and supported by new filaments. They worked their way smoothly through connective tissue, without rupturing any more of the host's cells. Tiny secretory nodules began to bud in the tissue around the wound, disgorging a cocktail of nutrients and proteins matched to the host's genetic blueprint. Others still began rallying the immune system, accepting toxins and broken pieces of the host for reconstitution into useful nutrients. Above the worse damage, a rough, greyish bark spread across blackened skin, expanding to encase the lower limb in a perfect supportive shell. Yet more filaments nudged bone slivers carefully back into alignment in preparation for reinforcement during the host's next period of rest.

Satisfied for the moment with the healing process, the ancient plant resumed its search for the all-powerful, eternal sun.

"I can smell him on you!" Petra hissed accusingly as she hovered over Dr Mayer's shoulder to watch the MRI display. 

On one screen in the array, a camera showed a view of Chris lying patiently in a hospital gown, entombed in the white depths of the expensive piece of imaging equipment. His bulky body barely squeezed into the scanner's barrel, but they'd made it work. Another monitor was just beginning to resolve a few confusing greyscale images of some section of his body.

"She's been sampling the product," Claire agreed, narrowed green eyes glinting disapproval.

"Maybe she needs a reminder that she's not his broodmate," the blonde continued with menace. "I'm not above a few friendly taps if the message isn't getting through."

Emelia chuckled, ignoring the posturing dragonesses, using the mouse to click through a series of setting options on the console. Her apparent nonchalance drove the pair to step away into a muttered conference of quiet gesticulations. The truth was, Emelia just didn't care. His protective mates only had one valid point of leverage over her, and it wasn't a back-alley-beatdown. If they couldn't figure it out, she wasn't about to tell them. 

The MRI began to thunk and whistle loudly, collecting another short series of test images as she began to instruct the program, selecting the field of view, slice, phase, planes, and a host of other parameters which would hopefully elucidate the structure of his soft tissues. If his anatomy was half as fascinating as his biochemistry, she could collect enough data to write a few hundred research papers. But the part of his body she was eager to delve into contained a most fascinating biochemical mystery. Analysing a dragon's physical constitution was all well and good but...

"You're imaging his cock!" Petra bleated indignantly as her next suspicious glance at the screens finally registered the Dr's intended target. The cross-section of bundled muscles and dense bone of his thighs were well defined by the machine's radio-emissions, a fainter cut-through of a fleshy tube rested above them.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 14|
--------------------------------------------
The mother dragoness' incensed cry must have reached him inside the loud compartment in the other room because Emelia's subject twitched and raised his head.

"Is something wrong?" Chris asked, a little edgy to be jammed in such a cramped, claustrophobia-inducing space.

"Hold very still please, Chris," Emelia pressed the talk button and spoke calmly into the microphone. "We're just fine out here but the stiller you are, the sooner I can let you go."

"Fine my ass!" Petra growled but kept her voice lowered.

"If you zap his swimmers you're a fucking dead woman," agreed Claire heartily.

Emelia sighed, this would be so much easier if she were alone with him. She'd hoped his zealous minders would go their own way after their appointment with Dr Chang. They were righteously protective of the fascinating young man, but she supposed she couldn't blame them with her track record. With the machine's programming loaded and about to get underway, Emelia swivelled in her chair to face his pregnant mates.

"Look, ladies, his sperm will be just fine," she paused, thinking back to a few inconclusive studies she'd heard of before qualifying her answer to her scowling, beautiful audience. "Any possible damage would be fleetingly temporary anyway, so just clear the barrel a few times, and he'll be loaded for bear all over again. Besides, if his sperm are anything like his other cells, they'll be a bunch of resilient, tenacious bastards."

"Damn straight they are," Claire accepted proudly on her mate's behalf. "But what are you doing looking at his privates? And why do you smell ever so slightly like him?"

"Ahh, yes I suppose that does deserve an explanation. It is fascinating that you claim to be able to sense some sort of chemical emission identifiable as belonging to Chris," Emelia wondered, intrigued by the idea. She briefly contemplated starting a new research avenue to explore their olfactory sensitivity, but G protein-coupled receptors were hellishly tricky things to study without adding magic or the subtleties of dragon physiology to the mix.

"It's not a claim," Petra backed up her daughter. "We know."

"Very well, you're aware that I convinced Chris to give me some small samples of his blood, yes? Well, I've made some truly groundbreaking discoveries. His macrophage white blood cells, for example, are incredibly motile, aggressive, and seem to possess an... uncanny ability to befriend and cooperate with foreign immune systems. I also think he has somehow inherited some sort of immuno-genetic memory bank, allowing him to quickly produce antibodies for infections I highly doubt he's ever been exposed to. At least that's my working theory. Honestly, I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. He is, to be blunt, a biomedical gold mine."

"And I suppose you want the resource extraction rights?" Petra's eyes narrowed, hands twitching to do violence.

"Well, yes," Emelia cocked her head curiously at the woman's angry response. "I suppose it doesn't have to be him. Dragons, indeed Beings in general, have a lot to offer humanity in terms of medical science. I'm told you've spent time working as a nurse, working with humans?"

"Yes, some," the dragon admitted.

"Then you should appreciate the suffering we mere mortals face as our bodies rebel against us with cancers and various degenerative conditions. Aren't you terrified by the increasing emergence of resistance in microbes of all shapes and sizes? In Chris' blood, I have glimpsed potential answers for all these things and much much more. I also may have even discovered the root of your near immortality, the holy grail my former employer was so tempted by."

"You've tested it on yourself," Clair made the leap of logic, simultaneously horrified and fascinated as she watched her oblivious mate lying there calmly on the computer screen.

"Yes," Dr Mayer nodded, her stern bun of grey hair bobbing as her eyes flashed proudly. "It didn't take long to isolate a fraction of his blood serum that contained a range of very interesting low-weight genetic expression factors and stimulants. In lab cultures, my own cells started to show signs of telomere repair and increased DNA proofreading efficacy in the first generation. They seem to actually seek out and modify the behaviour of foreign cells, I can't even begin to explain how impossible that should be. They're nucleic, which means they're behaving like some sort of good samaritan RNA virus. I'm awaiting the arrival of a new machine which will allow me to do my own sequencing. I couldn't resist though. After the effect persisted for several generations without much degradation, I started human trials."

"Yourself. I see now. And what gives you the right?"

"Well, I don't see any other volunteers around here, do you? I'll admit, it seemed a bit rash even to myself, but it's not like the FDA is equipped to deal with something like this. I've known for a while that I'd have to take this leap at some stage. Otherwise, this technology might take decades to make it through ethics boards and animal testing. By then, I'll probably be infirm or dead. I wouldn't mind a few extra centuries to complete my research."

"But what if that's not the way it works?" Claire worried. "What happens if you can't get any more doses, or if your cells start repairing themselves so efficiently they turn cancerous? What if there's a magical component to all of this that can't be replicated? There are a thousand things that could go disastrously wrong with your experiments."

"All possible outcomes, and believe me, my devious old mind has run through some weaponisation scenarios that would make you pee your pants. But we will never know unless we look, and the potential is too great to ignore. That is why my next area of preliminary investigation is centered on Chris' remarkable ability to transfer magic... sexually. I understand this not a unique mechanism amongst your species?"

"No," Petra supplied reluctantly after a few awkward moments. She might not agree with the woman's attitude, but it would be better for her to be informed than ignorant of their basic biology. "Male dragons somehow evolved to collect and transfer magics while our females are more focused on containing and manipulating the energy. It can take years of concerted effort from a pair to gather enough magic to successfully energise a dragon egg. Magic seems to be fading from the world, so it's continuously growing harder to do so."

"But both of you are pregnant by him, and a vampire too," Emelia raised her eyebrow challengingly, striking to the heart of the issue. The dragoness' furtive glance to her stoically scowling, cross-armed daughter was telling. There was a secret to be unravelled. "I hear it's caused quite a stir. I didn't believe my ears at first, but I could swear I overheard some mutterings about a prophecy if you credit such unlikely notions."

Petra considered her next words carefully, unwilling to disclose Chris' mysterious connection to ancient, enigmatic magical forces.

"He is unusually virile," the blonde nodded, deciding to boast of his prowess as a way of diversion. "I think it is an effect of his magical strength. It took my previous mate and I six months of almost exclusive rest and rutting to conceive Claire. Chris accomplished the same feat in our first coupling, but it is not the only remarkable aspect of his power. For example, he ranks high in the first strength category of magical Beings. His aspect is the otherworldly Ether, unique amongst dragons and seemingly a continuous wellspring of magic for his use. As a dragon male, when confronted with eager mates, he naturally harnessed his incredible power to do what he does best."

"I see."

"What's your interest?" Claire's asked. "You're a human, you cannot hope to harness or control his magic on your own. I guess there's money to be made, but we've got the market cornered on that front."

"I'm in this for the fascination, for the science, and I admit, for a little personal gain when the opportunity arises. Not anything as base as money," Emelia forestalled their protestations. "I couldn't care less about money other than to stock my research supplies and keep me in coffee and stroopie for life. Delicious chewy bastards. No, I want answers to questions. Don't you wonder how he can transfer such quantities of magic to you?"

"I know how he does it," Petra laughed. "It's absolutely delightful."

"Not sex," Emelia grunted, waving away the dragoness' humour. "I mean at the molecular level, the real mechanism. It's a challenge, an unanswered mystery. Magic goes against our current understanding of the universe, but I know I am the person for this research, at least in my field of biochemistry and medical science. I feel like my life has been preparation up to this point, training to bring me to this pinnacle. I've been gathering the experience and knowledge for decades, and now I'm right at the pioneering edge of a frontier where I can discover something truly new and useful for a change."

A chill ran down Petra's spine, a premonition that the sort of knowledge this woman sought was the equivalent of magical polonium. Worse, the sweet, innocent test subject was possibly the most fruitful individual on the planet from which to squeeze such answers.

Claire frowned thoughtfully. The scientist's ardour had done little to soothe her concerns, but her own interest was awakened. How did he do it? Chris was no normal dragon male, the brood knew that now. Could the doctor actually provide them with some much-needed answers to his origins and abilities? She'd been toying with the idea of furthering her own education in the medical field, hadn't she? This might prove a valuable opportunity to become involved if she had the brains. It would be prudent just to keep an eye on this old snake of a woman.

"Lillian was right, you're definitely some sort of evangelical scientific fanatic or something. I'm worried your work could lead downhill very quickly for us dragons if it comes out we're a bunch of walking, talking fountains of youth. That sounds like a dragon hunting nightmare all over again, but I can appreciate the potential to do good. Perhaps you're right though, it should at least be investigated. It seems almost criminal to ignore the possibilities if it's as groundbreaking as you claim."

"It is."

"I can't believe you're agreeing with her, Claire," Petra groused. "This is dangerous. Chris was already kidnapped over it and the good doctor here poisoned him, or had you forgotten?"

"I haven't, mother. But if Chris can work with her, so can I," Claire's reply sounded a little terser in her ears than she'd planned, and she softened it as she flipped her reasoning into a question. "Are you saying you'd let thousands of people die painful, preventable deaths rather than even consider doing the research?"

"No... that's not," Petra paused, reconsidering. "I mean... Oh, I don't know!"

"I understand your concern. That's why Chris has full rights over all of my research and findings. Our contract stipulates that I don't release a breath of it to anyone without his permission. In fact, I'm in breach just talking to you without his say so." Emelia swivelled back, activating the microphone again to address Chris. "Try to stay as still as possible Chris, we're almost done. Could you please nod slowly if you agree that I can discuss my research with your overbearing mates? I'm being read the riot act out here."

Chris smiled at that image, nodding a few times. It was good Lillian wasn't out there too, he trusted Claire and Petra to keep their cool about whatever Emelia was hatching. The vampire, not so much.

He hoped the Doctor's involvement wasn't too bitter a pill for his brood to swallow. That encounter with one of Reyla's 'Old Gods' was confounding, terrifying, but the directive to explore, to understand the universe and its workings came through clear enough. His efforts so far had already sent his magical abilities soaring to godlike heights under Hailey's imaginative tutelage. But it was painfully clear to Chris that there were superior intellects out there, far better suited for the actual scientific groundwork than his own. He hoped Dr Mayer could be a valuable link in that process, if she could be convinced to dial back the unhinged scientist routine.

In the monitoring room, shielded from the strong magnetic field, the tense, almost sullen silence was broken by a ping. The three women put aside their differences, at least temporarily, to view the incoming results.

"My god, look at it. Magnificent," Emily leaned closer to the screen as grayscale cross sections of Chris' groin began to arrive at the console.

Behind her, the dragoness' shared a conspiratory giggle.

"Phrasing," Claire chimed.

"Not his penis, you lusty girl," the doctor glanced to the bottom of the first image where one cross section displayed every detail of his endowment. "Though I admit it is quite remarkable. Here, look at his seminal vesicles. This isn't at all consistent with human norms. They're enormous, practically surrounding the bladder and the tissue is showing up far too dense on the scan. It's...engorged? If I didn't know better, I'd think they were cancerous, but maybe the cavities are just full of fluid? It's the right settings to show up protein."

Petra glanced to her daughter who shot back a guilty look and stopped teasing her plump lower lip between her teeth. She smiled knowingly as the entranced doctor continued her assessment, oblivious to the effect her explanation was having on her audience. New slides and planes of view were explored as the clunking machine in the other room finally quieted.

"His whole secretory system is hyper-developed," Emelia mused. Her interest was well and truly piqued by what she was seeing. Chris might be wearing a human shape and conforming roughly, but it was clear the dragon had left its mark on his human body. You didn't have to delve into the innards of his reproductive tract to notice his abnormal size and dense musculature, but it was fascinating nonetheless. Physiology wasn't her true passion, but seeing the difference in these structures made her all the more excited to explore the corresponding abnormal molecular biology. She was sure it was just waiting for her to discover. "The bulbourethral gland is immense, as well as the prostate. He must produce a copious volume of pre-ejaculate?"

"Ahhhem," Petra interjected, clearing her throat. "Yes, and I suspect it may have a high fructose content."

"Simply fascinating." The woman took a small notebook from the breast pocket of her white coat and scribbled a brief notation down to investigate the claim. "Well then, onward and downward so to speak. Oh my, his bulb and ejaculatory muscles... well, that's not exactly relevant. I suppose this all makes sense in a polygamous species, but..."

"What?!" Claire pressed, much louder than she'd meant to.

"Hmm? Nothing, nothing really, it's just his testicles."

"What about them? Is there a problem?!"

"No. I was a little taken aback by the number of lobes is all. They're very tightly packed, even disregarding their volume it would mean..."

"Hey? Is this thing still going?" Chris was finally sick of waiting around inside the MRI after it was apparently all over.

He had pregnant mates to fuss over, and an underground house to build, firearms training to resume, and a boss who wanted him to go on a cross-state mob-style intimidation mission that evening. Last night, he and that boss had crossed the boundary into the territory of committed lovers, but he still had to keep it a secret at work! That didn't even begin to take into account his other lovely mates who vied for his time and attention.

There were calls to make, research on protective runecrafting to conduct, and a fusion reactor to help design. If he ever got around to it, there was an enormous gold deposit just waiting for him to somehow requisition it from deep underground on an unknown property. Was that stealing? 

On top of it all, he lived in constant fear of vengeful elves, kidnappers, a demon, a fiance's parents who probably thought he was a demon, and the real possibility of the entire human race losing its collective shit over the damned Revelation. There simply wasn't time in the day to lie idly inside the scanning machine if it had finished its work.

"Yes, Chris, you can come out. I'm done for now." Dr Mayer spun on her chair to face his mates. Was it her imagination that their perfect complexions seemed a little rosy? There was no beating around this bush, so she just out and made her request. "I need a sample."

The dragoness' started speaking at the same time. The elegant mother voicing what sounded like an adamant negative, while the willful daughter said something about conditions. Hands on flaring hips, or arms crossed under breasts that Emilia would have defined as unfair in her ignorant, wild youth, the two dragons stared at each other. Their silent communication was complex, if slightly comical. It involved a series of lip twitches, a huff, two sets of raised eyebrows, lots of flashing green eyes, a cocked head, a hair flick, and even a tiny, indignant stomp of a sneaker.

The ubiquitous yellow-capped plastic sample bottle made a clack on the desk as Emelia set it down with finality, interrupting them.

But both women looked at it questioningly for a moment, then forgot their quiet tiff and outright laughed at her. Genuine mirth was not the reaction Emelia expected; she didn't get it. Petra even put a hand on her daughter's shoulder, apparently needing support as she almost doubled over with their shared humour.

"There, will be, conditions," the redhead giggled around her hand.

"Like finding a bigger container for a start!" Petra redoubled her musical laughing.

"Mom's right, of course, but I want some oversight over what you're getting up to," Claire elaborated, managing to get herself under control. "If you can agree to keep me updated and spend a little time explaining your process and findings, I'll cooperate. Chris is too busy to stay up to date with your reckless progress, so I'll step into some sort of a liaison role."

"And I want you taking the pheromone cancellation potion like your life depends on it," the blonde added.

Emelia considered, oversight was precisely what she didn't want, but the dragoness' cooperation was more than she'd actually hoped for. She picked up the sample jar, frowning speculatively at it.

"Okay, I accept. You say this isn't going to be adequate?"

"Not nearly," Petra smirked. "We'll keep him distracted for a bit but I can tell he's antsy to get back to work, so we should make this quick if we're actually going to do it. You'd better go find something bigger, doctor."

"But what about collec..." Emelia started.

"We'll take care of that," the dragoness' chimed in happy unison.

"Guys?" Chris rapped on the door to the little screen-lit operator's suite. "Is the magnet off? Can I get back in my clothes? I um, I don't mean to rush you Dr Mayer, but I've got a lot to do this afternoon."

"We're almost done, honey," Petra cracked the door. "Why don't you come in here for a second and have a look at the scans, hmm?"

"Go," Claire whispered in Emilia's ear. "Hurry."

Emilia rushed away, ignoring her slightly perplexed test subject as she brushed past him on her vital mission. She made for Harold's supply cupboard, rifling through the shelves with increasing frustration and disregard for tidiness. There were a couple of containers that might have worked, but how big did it need to be? They'd laughed at a seventy-millimetre container, what sort of inadequacy did laughter imply? What kind of multiplication factor did she need to apply? Her mind raced back through the MRI scans, following impossible volume estimations down rabbit holes as she searched.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 15|
--------------------------------------------
She found an unused sharps collector which undoubtedly had the required volume, but the plastic lid was designed specifically to stay on. That was a deal breaker because the one-way orifice possessed a pit-trap of inch-long plastic teeth no self-possessed male would dream of pointing his equipment at.

Finally giving up on the ruined supply closet, she bustled into the staff break room in search of a bowl, or heaven forbid, someone's half-cleaned Tupperware. She really wanted that sample.

Salvation came in the form of a box of jumbo-sized ziplock sandwich-bags they kept under the sink. Handy things, or so she thought as she scuttled back to the MRI suite in triumph.

Emelia still couldn't believe Reyla had purchased Dr Chang his own MRI. He claimed it was second hand from a hospital and picked up for a bargain, but she knew the expense of even preparing the room to safely operate such a huge magnet could be monstrously expensive. There might be magic involved though.

"A baggie?" Petra hissed quietly as they made their hushed liaison just outside the monitoring room. "We'll be lucky if he doesn't blow straight through it. I guess it will have to do. Okay, stay out of sight, he can still be a bit shy sometimes."

Heart thumping with elicit excitement, Emelia listened at the door. The two women worked like a well-oiled team. With cooed words and gentle kisses, they quickly co-ordinated against and then overwhelmed his startled but weak protestations. It was over soon. Ending in an extended series of deep, satisfied grunts, accompanied by delighted giggling and lewd, mock-astonished encouragement.

Later, after they were gone and she was left with an alarmingly occupied bag of warm, thick semen, Emelia brought up the room's camera feed. They had worked together alright, one beauty whispering and nibbling in each of his ears as he sat, throbbing and enormous between them. They shared him, each dragoness taking part of his length in hand, a fat testicle gently cradled and tugged in the other. Once started, they didn't let up. Eyes tight shut, he erupted into the tenuous vessel in a mighty series of bucking, white volleys that set even her neglected old nethers a-quiver.

***

Reyla should have known she was in for a terrible day. What else could she expect after abandoning her territory? Barely two days of neglect left a line of petitioners stretching all the way out the great doors, clamouring for her attention. It was a nightmare morning in court. 

Nevermind that she had just exhausted herself bending her energies toward their protection, to maintaining the tattered remnants of the Secret they all clung to. She was still magically drained, and tired, and cranky. Not everyone could have a dragon of their own to replenish their magic as if by... well, magic.

It was as if her subjects took her return as licence to brazenly voice their most ridiculous complaints: Her modest tax on magical transactions was too high. The conditions leading up to the Revelation were too strict. Someone's uncle had cheated them out of a magical family heirloom. Rufus Valdeer's successful nightclub was too loud and too full of vampires. More to the point, they had the audacity to kick out drunken magelings from powerful families for stressing the limits of the protective charms with 'harmless' shows of co-ed impressing magic. There wasn't enough regulation on the sale of new dragon crystals. There was too much regulation on the sale of new dragon crystals. Dragon crystals, dragon crystals, dragon crystals. Reyla wanted to scream.

Worse, it emboldened some of them to new heights of entitlement and pettiness. There was one young elf noble in particular who was there just to push her buttons. She knew he was basically a spy, that someone was putting him up to it, but he really needed a lesson in the realities of appropriate behaviour in her court.

He pranced, back and forth in front of her throne. Pranced! With an audience of her rowdy subjects behind him, his tongue softly lashed her with saccharin-veiled advice on how to better rule her 'meagre kingdom.'

As her ears twitched with barely suppressed rage, Reyla fantasized his gruesome, painful end.

Perhaps an agonisingly slow submersion in a strong caustic solution. She knew where to find a particularly nasty strain of flesh-beetles that would surely appreciate dining on his softest, most precious masculine parts. But she felt her favourite magic calling to her, the chill of her beautiful dark ice.

She would have him chained in some filthy dungeon, dropping by every few days as the fancy took her to drive another bolt of shadowfrost through a limb. The wounds would advance slowly toward his core, and if she was patient, she might draw out his eventual demise over an entire week. It would be fascinating to see which claimed him first, hypothermia or sepsis.

The dragon would no doubt be sickened by her cruel thoughts, but they were only idle fantasy really. One of her more orthodox sisters might flay the 'pale mutt' for his insolence. Her mother certainly would, but then the foolish young elf would never dare show his face in her subterranean halls.

Reyla considered herself a relatively tame, subdued Drow. Her moderate nature had won her her territory after all. Despite her position though, leniency had made her rule the butt of many a barbed joke from her family over the centuries.

The House Galentyr noble was safe from her reprisals for now. The trade his family company brought to her territory was too valuable to even risk offending the young upstart by telling him where he could shove his unsolicited advice. She knew they were allied with Lefayd. Since the great house had disgraced itself, Galentyr had slipped two agents her way under the guise of evaluating her territory's newly flourishing magical trade. She couldn't exactly call their bluff because everyone else was doing it too. There truly were opportunities to be had with Chris handing out his magic like penny candy.

As if to drive that point home, she saw that the dwarves had finally overcome their cautious nature. An Alliance-certified journeyman smith and his busty female cousin were there to petition for her patronage. They hailed from Kaellamac Hold in the bleak Yukon Ranges far to the north. A journeyman wasn't a particularly lavish gesture from the Alliance, but it was not to be scoffed at. Reyla accepted, of course, adding another shiny speck to the brilliance of her rising star.

That had been the fleeting highlight of her morning. It was quickly dashed by speculative whispering as Timothy slipped into her court and glided to her side to whisper the foul news of Susan's assault in her ear. Reyla was genuinely stunned, and it must have shown on her face because the disquieted mutterings from the pews grew fretful.

The theft was so brazen, so clearly calculated, and so like the Syndicate. It was her fault, too. She'd offered them insult by blowing off their second meeting with the emergency trip to Argentina, so they'd flexed their muscles. What got to her though was that they'd brought those type of hitters with them to begin with. They were serious about getting their hands on dragon crystals, the fools.

It was going to backfire, of course. Hadn't they caught wind of what he'd done to Lefayd? Perhaps they had, and were now counting on Chris' need to walk on eggshells around the Synod to protect them from reprisal. Clever, it might work, at least in the short term. The dragon would need to be restrained from seeking vengeance.

Susan had done the right thing by keeping Chris in the dark temporarily, but Reyla wished she hadn't gone and called all her clients to apologize and explain what had happened. Several of them arrived within the hour to swell her schedule with demands for action and sanctions. They were led by the enchantress Tamara, who Reyla genuinely respected. But she couldn't agree to their calls for action, it would have been a declaration of war on one of the most powerful trade entities in the Being world.

A crotchety grandmother witch and her missing goat later, the young vampire Amanda interrupted proceedings by barging into the vast room. Reyla knew something was very wrong before the woman had taken her third sprinting pace up the lush red carpet to deliver a phone to her hand.

Just how wrong should have been obvious from her head of security's stressed tone. More, by his admission that he didn't know what he was dealing with and needed her immediate help. But now, as Reyla stepped through the boundary of the hastily erected deference-charm around the old apothecary's shop, even she was brought up short. 

Susan lay naked, suspended more than ten feet up in the freezing winter's air. Her limbs posed as if crucified, eyes closed in lifeless serenity as her long black hair whipped about in the stiff breeze. The scenario might not have been so bad if not for the mass of dark vines punching into her shoulders, lower back, and calves. The branches spiralled and twisted around each other to form some sort of thick, knotty trunk, erupting from the cracked the snowy pavement below. The evil thing must have burst up out of the cold earth to impale the poor woman. 

"Gods, she's skewered," Reyla whispered to herself when her mouth stopped hanging open uselessly. Hot tears began welling unbidden in her eyes, her heart turning icy with calculating rage. Synod be damned, this crime would not go unanswered. "The Syndicate will pay for this, dearly!"

Along the witch's outstretched arms and across the pale skin of her exposed front budded thinner, flexible stems. Unfurling outward in mimic of a fern, they displayed small arrays of black leaves along their length. It formed a broad, frilly halo around the witch's body, waving sympathetically with her hair in the gusts blowing down from the north.

"My Lady, it wasn't the Syndicate," a gruff voice rasped beside her, causing the elf to round on the proprietor of the establishment as he and Timothy approached. "At least, I don't think so. I saw Susan walk out here, called out to her. There was something wrong. When she ignored me, I followed. It grew out of... it grew out of her."

"What?!"

"I swear it, Lady Reyla," the old fellow begged, impotent tears beginning to well in his earnest eyes as he wrang his hands. "She just stood there looking up at the sun for a moment. I was shouting, but it was like she couldn't hear. It just... it burst out of her skin like a nest of terrible black snakes, all writhing and waving about. It was so fast! Smashed right into the ground and started growing. Her clothes started shredding off when the little ones came out, the whole thing took less than a few minutes."

"Look closely, Reyla," the tall elemental urged beside her. "Where is the blood? She's naked but her one injured foot is bound."

"Don't forget, she's breathing," Rowan added hopefully. "I've never heard of any spell like this, have you?"

"You're right, she yet lives," Reyla murmured, fascinated as she began examining the suspended witch with magical senses. There was a powerful magical aura there, but it was off. Impressions from the previous evening's dinner at the dragon household didn't match what she saw before her. This thing was dark, and slow, and very old. "It... We must find Chris immediately, the dragon should be here."

"Lillian has already gone to collect him. She already tried to get close but whatever it is just about harpooned her to the pavement with something from the trunk. It saw her coming, and it's damn quick." The flame-spirit's tone indicating he had a growing respect for the thing, at least from a professional standpoint. "Reyla, what is it?"

"I do not know, which concerns me greatly," the elf admitted, tall and dark in her human form. "Something about it tickles maddeningly at an ancient memory, but it is yet to surface. Wizard, you say she was acting peculiarly? Take me to her witch's kitchen."

"Of course, Lady," Rowan nodded gravely.

"Timothy, we must contain this area. We need more of your men walking the streets. If this is the Syndicate's work they may still be lurking. Reinforce the charm and start laying some weaker spell rings of repellency and forgetfulness further afield for the humans. Use a vomitous hex if you think it necessary but no one must lay eyes on this... this malignant tree. For all we know it may become a long-term feature if we cannot uproot it. Talk to Michelle about our options if that is the case."

Reyla followed the venerable wizard around the southern edge of his carpark, skirting the thing with as much distance as possible. He led her through the front door into his shop, were she paused with her senses wide.

It had been years since she had visited her craftsfolk personally. Sitting resentfully in her court was perhaps providing an unfairly dirty window into her subject's affairs.

"I confess I am impressed by your assemblage, Rowan Eddard," she said once she had seen her fill. Walking over to a shelf in the corner of the room and reaching high to extract a dusty jar from amongst its gruesome counterparts, she turned to smile at the old man. "I don't imagine many customers ask for the pickled dark-weed galls of my homeland's great lakes, or your other more obscure stock. It is nice to know that someone in my realm appreciates a broad range of... tastes. Why, even the sight of these reminds me of my childhood."

"They are yours, Lady Reyla. Take them, take them if they please you. I can't attest to their quality any more, they've sat there unbothered for years. Since I made my last batch of black-antivenin if memory serves, but at my age, that's no sure thing."

"I couldn't," Reyla returned the jar to its resting place. "It is good you use them for such qualities, some of my sisters were not so scrupulous. Besides, I always preferred them fresh."

"As you wish. This way please," Rowan announced, very satisfied with himself after the praise from his icy ruler. "I'll show you where Susan worked. She was a promising talent you know, I've never seen her like in skill for tending magical plants."

In Susan's pavilion, they found the strange scene of her preparations. The shattered glass of the seed's containment vial was particularly interesting to Reyla, who used an incantation to restore an image of its intact form. So freshly broken, the memory in the glass was still strong. She read the runes it once bore, designed to hold stable and contain. But what had it contained?

Her instinct pinged off a frustrating, stubborn old memory and she scowled savagely. She didn't want to involve anyone else, least of all her mother, but what choice did she have? Taking axe and saw, or pitch and flame to the tree seemed like a terrible idea with the witch still somehow attached to it.

Reyla was saved the decision for a few moments more when she spotted the young ditríff in their new enclosure. A white eyebrow cocked in the squirming apothecary's direction. Magical plants were by no means an area in which she considered herself an expert, but she had encountered these before. Hungry white rootlets were already spreading eagerly down into the moistened bed of yellowish-green moss.

"They were mine until recently. Dormant of course." Rowan pulled nervously at the collar of his dirty robe, clearly uncomfortable under the piercing scrutiny of her grey eyes. "Susan asked me for them after she was attacked. I thought it might do her good to work on something that helped her feel more secure. She said that she'd been terrified by her attackers and offered little resistance during the robbery. I think... I think it shamed her deeply. I'm sorry, I'll destroy them right away."

"Hold, Rowan. You are not to blame. Indeed, such precautions may be necessary for the future if you wish to continue selling the dragon's bounty. Your insight into her state of mind is revelatory though. I believe now that her current predicament is self-inflicted, though for the life of me I do not know what creature has taken hold of her."

"I think so, too," the wizard croaked. He wiped hurriedly at his eyes to collect moisture onto the back of a wrinkled, work-worn hand. "I should have watched her more closely, but she looked at me so..."

"Hush, fault lies with the brigands who attacked peaceful folk like you and Susan," Reyla comforted, tentatively patting at his shoulder. Say what you would about how they vexed her to distraction, she was a fierce protectress of her subjects. "And with me, for failing to protect you from them. Let us go see Susan, I may have one final card to play before we resort to our own rash action. Though I'm loath to place it on the table."

Chris had arrived by the time they emerged back into the grim chill. The young dragon was nigh inconsolable. Magically enhanced vision let her see that Lillian and the two wide-eyed dragoness' had encircled him, restraining hands on his shaking body. Timothy was trying his best to explain that Susan was still alive but it didn't seem to be having the desired effect.

There were fresh signs of a scuffle in the dirty snow around the group. A red trickle spilled from a rapidly sealing split in the vampire's lip. Seeing that might have coaxed a smile to Reyla's lips at another time, but not today. Lillian's entire left side was dark with dirty water and splotched with snow. They'd a hard time of it apparently, but soft touches and loving words seemed to be holding the grief-stricken man back for the moment.

Reyla sighed, producing her Maginet phone from the pocket of her fur-lined cloak. She took a few careful steps toward the impaled witch for a better view. For the first time, she realised that Susan's body, indeed the whole dark construct, was aimed perfectly to face the dimming afternoon sun. The woman's face showed none of the pain she should rightfully feel, she looked almost... tranquil?

The elf assumed Susan wouldn't care about her modesty if she somehow survived this ordeal. So she felt no qualms snapping a photo which revealed her pale breasts and dark thatch of pubic hair in full detail. It was the dark tree-thing growing from that curvaceous, suspended form that was of concern. Backing warily away to stand by herself, Reyla began composing a suitable message to accompany the picture.

It wasn't an easy decision to seek her mother's guidance. Things had mellowed between them over the centuries since their major falling out. Still, words had been given screaming voice in that conflagration that could never be erased by time. They'd nearly killed each other. Distance worked wonders to patch their relationship now. These days they were civil and even shared a grudging respect for one another. They had common enemies and occasionally participated in joint schemes to ruin them. Ultimately, they were still mother and daughter. It was just best for all involved that they didn't see too much of each other, lest old habits and passions reignite.

"Mother, I hope this finds you well," Reyla mouthed to herself as she tapped the message into her screen. No, that was too obsequious. "Mother, I need the wisdom of your advanced years. What am I dealing with?"

Simple, a little barbed, good enough. She sent it, and began walking over to try her hand at reassuring Christopher. His mates had him gently corralled in a prison of warm, loving bodies. Annabel and the sprite had just arrived, the girl taking charge of the effort with a general's efficiency. Two pregnant dragoness' hugged his front, pressing themselves firmly against him. Invisible to the unaided eye, Lillian embraced him from behind, her strength ready to hold him back at the first twitch of his muscles. The blue pest was sitting on one of his shoulders running small, soothing hands through his short hair. Finally, Annabel clung to his other side, head resting against a bicep as she meshed her fingers with his again and again.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Chris' sad eyes hadn't left Susan for a moment. Though he was more docile now, Reyla could read each pang of the anguish he felt, written clearly on his grief-twisted features. Wet tear-trails streaked his cheeks and his magic was leaking discordantly out for all with the skill to see. A fluctuating, barely maintained containment nowhere near equal to the task.

"Christopher, let your magic..." Reyla's phone began ringing most inopportunely and she scowled at the pesky device. It was her mother, of course, with a suspiciously rapid response. "Sorry, I have to take this. It's about Susan."

"Good evening, daughter," the silky voice spoke down the line as Reyla answered. "My but you're having all the fun these days, aren't you?"

"Hello, mother," Reyla answered curtly, turning away from the inquisitive looks of the dragon's brood. "How are you?"

"Really, Reyla? Small talk? Why don't you instead explain to me how you had a sueth-azoah living right under your nose, but I wasn't informed of such delicious news until now?"

"Sueth-azoah..." Reyla whispered more to herself than in response.

"Oh daughter, you didn't know, did you?" the voice tinkled with amusement. "How delightful. I suppose they were already dwindling before your time so it is no surprise. With all that time you spent locked away in my library while the others played at warriors and mages, I thought you might have found reference to them."

"I remember reading something," Reyla frowned. "It's not coming back easily... something about assassinations?"

"That's right. Yes, for a few hundred years a number of our Clans favoured them for brute force attacks on the day-folk's strongholds. One elf, infested with a sueth-azoah, could usually break, burrow, or chop their way through a castle's rock, and a score or more of defenders on their way to claim a critical head. Accounts I have heard say they were only thwarted when their magic was spent or the plant was so damaged it began consuming the host to survive. They were too effective though, and used too recklessly."

"It is fatal then? A parasite?" Reyla asked dejectedly.

"Well, yes. Though it is more something between a parasite and a symbiote. If the host body runs low on mana and the sueth-azoah feels it can no longer sustain itself, it will bolt to seed to preserve its germ. I never witnessed such a thing myself but I'm told it's quite the horrific process. They're thought to be extinct, you know."

"But this just happened today, Mother! Will Susan survive? The dragon is beside himself and the Syndicate is, in part at least, to blame for all this. I cannot have him burning the Shanghai docksides to the foundations in revenge."

"Slow down," the elf matriarch chuckled darkly. "Explain yourself, daughter."

So Reyla did, realising much too late the price her mother intended to extract in return.

"Fascinating... It must be bonding with the host somehow. My dear, it sounds like you're in well over your head. Perhaps a visit from your wise old mother is in order. There is much I could do to assist in setting your realm in order, and besides, it is beyond time I met this dragon. Whispers of him have begun to reach even my ears all the way down here. You have been a willful daughter to keep him to yourself for so long, but I will forgive you that."

"No."

"No? And shall I keep my advice on the sueth-azoah to myself also?"

Her mother's tone contained a quiet, dangerous note Reyla had learned to fear from a young age. She hated that it still set her heart quickening in fear.

"That is to say, I am busy, mother. You may come for a day or two, a week at most, but I have not the patience to entertain your schemes beyond that. And you will come with one retainer only."

"Hmph, ungrateful child. You would have me travel like a pauper and kick me out of your house like some overstaying day-filth when you are done with me? Spiteful, Reyla, spiteful." Her mother paused for good measure, letting her reprimand draw out for dramatic effect. "Very well then, I will make the arrangements."

Reyla suppressed a growl of frustration. If you didn't make those sorts of stipulations with the infuriating woman, she was likely to show up with an escort of battle-sisters. In the best case, you had to feed and house fifty petulant Drow, driving your subjects to rebellion in the process. In the worse case, they carved you up, slowly.

"What of the sueth-azoah, mother? Your advice?"

There was a long pause.

"Well, there isn't much of anything to do, Reyla. You must let it run its course."

"Bitch," Reyla seethed. "I had more useful advice from a Galentyr rat in my court this very morning."

"There's my loving little strumpet," her mother laughed infuriatingly. "Expect me soon, dearest daughter."

Reyla wanted to throw her phone in the snow and stomp on it until it crunched no more. Instead, she forced several score of deep, calming breaths and went to relay the somewhat hopeful news.

"Chris, I know you're hurting, and I'm sorry," Reyla spoke softly, reaching past Annabel to touch the warm skin of his forearm. "I was going to suggest that it is acceptable to let your magic free in a time of emotional turmoil. In fact, it might do you some good."

"What... what happened to Susan?" His shoulder's shuddered with halting breaths. "My Susan."

"My mother called it a sueth-azoah, an ancient and very rare creeping plant that seems to share a host's body and magic. Chris, Susan did this to herself. I know you must want to run over there and cut her down but that would be a terrible mistake. She would almost certainly die if you succeed. That... thing is part of her now. We must wait and hope that she endures whatever process has taken hold. That is your best chance of having her back."

His great body seemed to sag, to go limp at her words. Reyla felt the tension ease from the taut muscle beneath her dark fingertips. A wordless, mournful cry broke free from his chest as his radiant aura burst forth, unfettered by his restraining efforts. It was as dazzling as ever to behold, washing through Reyla's every cell to bathe her in intoxicating magic. It was impossible to ignore, there was a powerfully sorrowful taste to his essence now. 

The release elicited a series of sympathetic gasps or choked sobs from the present Beings. The extent of his love and loss was undeniable. Reyla found herself wicking unbidden tears away once again, and not only because she felt the depth of his affection for the dark-haired witch. In an instant, she was certain that no one in her millennia of life had ever loved her as the dragon loved his broken broodmate. Not her mother, her sisters, nor any of her infrequent lovers over the centuries would weep so bitterly, so openly at Reyla's suffering.

The ancient elf finally understood now. It wasn't just the sex that drove these women to bind themselves to him, or the incredible magic. He loved them all, truly loved each and every one of them. A tenth of his potential for intimacy, to care and cherish was more than anyone had ever offered to her.

Shaken by that revelation, Reyla stayed with them and kept vigil as the sun crept toward the horizon. Ever dependable, Timothy organised the delivery of warm coats for those who had rushed unprepared into the snowy chill. Word quickly spread amongst the Denver Beings, first of the attack on Susan, and then of the further incident and the dragon's mournful watch over his mate. Many hurried to the scene to witness the spectacle or attempt to voice their support. The security team kept them politely away. Soon food, blankets, and thermoses full of hot beverages began to arrive as if by magic. They were shared by all as they waited, hoping.

In the last, low angle rays of light, the sueth-azoah was finally satisfied. The strange tree-like structure quivered for a moment before it began shrinking and retracting its many limbs back into Susan's body. Everyone watched the sinister, almost serpentine grace of the vines, mesmerized as the witch began gently sinking to the ground.

Chris was up and pounding his way across the carpark to her before anyone could think to restrain him.

With the final dark filaments retreating seamlessly back inside her, Susan's eyes peeked open. She let out an indignant shriek as her bare foot touched the snow. Half a second later she was tackled into a fierce, warm, and wonderfully familiar hug. If not for the instant turgor response of a new cell layer incorporated beneath her skin, she might have sustained a few broken ribs.

His scent surrounded her just as surely as his thick arms. It washed away the last of the tension and worry that lingered from the bizarre awakening of new limbs, magics, and plant-like urges. The experience over the past hours was beyond anything she'd ever imagined after reading that damn elfin book.

"I'm fine, Chris. It's me. I'm just fine," Susan clung to him, returning his urgent kisses. He seemed to be undecided between kissing her, squeezing fiercely until she could barely breathe, and running his hands disbelievingly over her unblemished skin where moments ago had sprouted the sueth-azoah. "I'm sorry I frightened you."

"Thank God you're okay! Are you sure?" Chris was beside himself with relief to hear her voice. He cradled her face in his hands, leaning down to kiss her sweet lips again as he brushed windswept, midnight-hued hair behind an ear. "What happened?"

Susan looked down, hiding her face in his jacket because she was unwilling to admit to her impulsive actions just yet.

"Susan? Please, I was so worried."

"I was very silly, okay? I went and made a life-changing decision in the heat of the moment. I think it could have gone very badly, but I'm still here." She looked up at him searchingly, fearing to see anger and hurt in his eyes. "Please just hold me, Chris. Just take me home."

"Nothing would make me happier right now. I love you, Susan."

"And I you, honey-bun."

***

Claire watched indulgently from the kitchen bar as her mate cuddled and fussed over Susan. They'd heard the details of her story now. The witch thankfully looked unharmed except for her foot, if on the point of an emotional breakdown. To be fair, the entire brood was shaken, it had been a harrowing afternoon for them all.

Slim hands snaked around her midsection from behind, and Annabel's warmth pressed into her back, accompanied by a waft of homely scents from the kitchen.

"Isn't that adorable?" her First whispered, breathing close against the shell of her ear. "I'm half expecting Susan to bark at him to leave her alone."

"She would never," Claire countered, half turning her head. "I'd be playing it for all it was worth if it was me. This afternoon he was so... I don't know. Intense? I was sad for Susan, and I wanted to cry, but at the same time it felt nice to know that he cares so deeply for one of us."

"All of us," Annabel corrected softly. "I know what you mean though. I'm sorry your happy news hasn't had its time to shine. Twin girls? That's amazing, Claire."

"I didn't have much say in the matter, but thanks." She placed her hands over Annabel's on her slowly swelling tummy. They just hugged for a while in silent contemplation, ignoring Bartholomew's loving, boisterous nibbles where their skin met.

Through the open doorway, they watched as Chris returned from Susan's dresser with a hairbrush. A sigh was shared between the two observers as he coaxed the witch to lie back on his chest and he began gently easing out the afternoon's snags and tangles.

"It is happy news, isn't it?" Annabel asked offhandedly.

"Of course," the redhead was quick to assure. "Just unexpected and new. I hadn't even considered the possibility of twins in my wildest fantasies of our future. I... I am a little worried about complications. Doctor Chang says there are risks with them being identical and Chris would..."

"Chris will support you however you need." Annabel pressed her lips gently against Claire's warm cheek, a mostly platonic show of friendship and affection. "We all will. Look at him, rocking his loving protector routine in there. You know what he really is. Do you think something that powerful would let anything happen to your precious little love-bumps?"

"No," Claire smiled guiltily, looking down to squeeze Annabel's hands tightly and stroke the little tattoo that bounded excitedly along the border of their contact.

"I bet his magic has already been doing its part to make things go smoothly and healthily, even if it was unconscious. Now he's going to be on the case day and night, and you know what that means."

The dragoness giggled, her shapely bottom shimmying slightly in anticipation.

"Mom is going to be so jealous. At least she gets to say she bore his first son, I think it means a lot to her."

"You dragons, so powerful and so dumb sometimes," Annabel teased.

Claire's nails scratched playfully against Bartholomew's exposed belly.

"You know what I mean. But they're going to be powerful, Annabel, probably class one... or even... like their dad. I don't know, the thought just hit me as we were coming back with Susan. Is that even possible?"

"Hmm, who would know? I think we'll keep that possibility strictly to the family. Don't you think?"

"Agreed. Do you need any help with dinner? I'm not feeling nauseous or anything."

"No, I've got Immi stirring her little ass off to make some caramelised onions, and that's all I need for now. Thanks, though," Annabel chirped. "You could call Hailey and Michelle for me and let them know it's about half an hour away if they want to be here while it's hot."

"Okay, and thanks, Annabel. I can't wait to return all the support you've given me when you're ready to have children."

"Haha, don't mention it." Annabel bumped hips with her friend. "Maybe we can time it right and share the experience."

"I think I'd like that," Claire smiled right back and was about to embellish when everyone in the large apartment was stirred to alertness by a loud, formal rapping on the front door.

No one knocked like that.

"Claire, Annabel, please sit with Susan." Chris was suddenly at their sides, his voice half growl as he strode determinedly toward the entrance. "It's time I got some damn answers."

Neither woman had the chance to object to his potentially rash attitude before he barged past, and one look into the room at Susan sent them scurrying to obey his request. The witch was a nervous wreck.

"I'm such a fool," Susans hissed, looking up to meet their worried gaze. "Please, don't let him get in trouble over my rashness, my... mistake."

"Don't worry," Claire reassured, taking an only slightly nervous seat beside her. She couldn't shake the imagined images of tough, coiling things, those things, dragging her down into musty leaf-litter, never to rise again. "See, it's just Reyla. I'm sure she's here to check up, to see you're okay. You've been quite the hot topic on Maginet this evening, you know?"

At the front door, Reyla, back in the graceful splendour of her elf form was dismissing her escort and inviting herself in. The apparent nonchalance she displayed must have come from some hidden testicular reserve, given the eye-daggers thrown her way by Chris. He tended to pose a somewhat intimidating figure these days.

Whatever the elf's reason, Susan wasn't consoled by the prospect of a visit from their beneficent leader.

"I don't care. Don't you see? I betrayed his trust, br... broke something, when I didn't come to him for protection." The witch was on the point of tears now and relieved to unburden her fears to a more understanding audience. "He touches me, he smiles, bu... but it doesn't reach his ey... eyes!"

Annabel stared down at the bleary-eyed woman she'd known and admired for several years now. She was trying to decide how best to respond, how best to snap Susan out of self-pity.

"Enough!" Annabel shot a hand forward, pushing a finger against Susan's lips as she huddled down to deliver a harsh, and hopefully fruitful truth. Claire joined their little powwow, a surreptitious glance over her shoulder assuring that the elf still had Chris distracted with some long-winded explanation. "You did betray his trust, Susan. You betrayed all our trust, bringing danger into our home for poorly thought out reasons."

Susan squeezed her eyes shut, lips moving to form the beginnings of an abject whimper.

"Ah ah ah, I'm not finished," Annabel scolded quietly, internally praying that she wasn't momentarily shish-kebabed by some ominous witch-wood tendril. "What you need to do now is not compound that mistake, but to own it. You need to show him, show all of us, that you, that this... sueth-azoah, are still worthy of our trust, that you're still the same Susan we all love."

"And we do love you," Claire added supportively. "We don't understand what this means for you, or us, yet, but we are here. That is how a brood must function."

"You need to try to move past this somehow before the rest of us can follow." Annabel removed her finger, searching her friend's teary eyes. "I know it will be difficult, but you have to try. Please, Susan?"

"Okay," Susan whispered hoarsely, gulped, nodded, and looked to each of her broodmates with an ember of renewed hope glowing within. "Can I have a few days to wallow at least? I mean it all seems pretty blurry and rage-headed when I think back and..."

"YOU LET THEM GET AWAY?!" Chris' roar rebounded from the living area into the bedroom with all the anger and volume of Belthelas' favourite album. That was impressive because the release got banned in seven countries.

"Chris, no!" Annabel rounded, voicing her horror as she watched his large hands twitch forward toward the elf with the instinct of violence. She was already rushing forward to restrain him without conscious thought. "Immi! Claire! Help me!" 

"You promised me protection," the dragon hissed in Reyla's face, his snarl of primal rage almost breaking her steely composure. "I cannot tolerate an attack like this. You know that!"

"I do," Reyla lifted her chin proudly. "But the Syndic..."

Her explanation halted as, seemingly out of nowhere, an enormously powerful hand closed around her throat. Her eyes darted from the bulging arm cutting off her air up to his rage-filled gaze, marvelling in her final moments at the depth of his feeling, his protectiveness, his anger. She should be struggling, fighting tooth, nail, and spell against his ill-considered assault. Shamefully, her arms lay limp at her sides. All she seemed to be able to muster as she was lifted effortlessly into the air was a hopeless, full-bodied shudder of arousal.

"Master will put the elf down this instant!" A blue streak shot out of the kitchen, flapping jauntily on ever-growing wings. She collided with his broad back, clawed up onto his shoulder, and proceeded to beat on the side of his thick skull with an onion-infused spatula.

"She's!"

Smack.

"Just!"

Thump.

"Enjoying it!

"Enough, Chris." Annabel tugged at his drow-suspending arm, adrenaline radiating through her rushing blood as she reached his side. "Think for a moment, Reyla didn't do any of this. Calm down, please?!"

"Please, it's my fault," Susan spoke shakily from the doorway to her bedroom, the redhead at her side for support.

Her words seemed to sap the dragon's unreasoning fury, and Reyla was dropped unceremoniously to stagger, catch her breath, and rub at her throat.

"It wasn't, Susan. How could it be?" Chris asked, hoarse-voiced as Immi's sticky attempts at discipline ceased. "I should have been there to protect you. Then you never..."

"No," Reyla interjected. She coughed, regained her breath, and continued. "The Syndicate is to blame for all of this, and the failing in Susan's protection is mine."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 17|
--------------------------------------------
"Good Lord. Can we just stop it with the stupid pity-party?" Annabel's exasperation dripped from every huffed syllable. "It doesn't change anything, and you lot sure as hell don't look like it's making anyone feel better about themselves."

The guilty parties glanced to Annabel, who seemed to radiate a stern aura of good sense. Chris shrugged shamefully, supposing that she was probably correct. He wasn't feeling any better for having tried to strangle Reyla, he felt wretched.

"I'm sorry, Reyla. The dragon... I am very angry and frustrated right now."

"And so you should be," Reyla nodded, accepting the sincerity of his words. Her body still felt weak and rebellious despite having sustained no lasting harm. Her instinct seemed to be flip-flopping alarmingly between the urge to fight and, well, fuck. No one had dared touch her like that in centuries, and it was telling that she, Lady Reyla Narlakis went limp as a kitten under a little of his rough handling. "I let the Syndicate slip away because it would only hurt us to seek vengeance openly. You cannot; we cannot afford another scene with magic in the open. It is a treacherous path to tread, but I promise I will help you get the retribution your dragon demands. The reward will be all the sweeter, even if it is months or years in the making. That is what I was trying to explain."

Ashamed, Chris slowly looked around the room to his brood, meeting their eyes. His draconic anger still simmered fitfully in his chest, but it had cooled from its dangerous boil. He watched the women he loved for assurance, for their approval that his impotence wouldn't somehow shame them, especially Susan, the one he had failed so thoroughly. Even little Immi was silently consulted, panting and splattered with brown onion-sauce where she straddled his shoulder. 

"We'll get the bastards eventually," Susan nodded determinedly. "And I'll be bringing a friend."

"You'll be bringing a whole dragon's brood," Claire grinned savagely beside her, teeth flashing.

Smiling a little to see their renewed spirit, Chris startled everyone by turning back to Reyla and sweeping the dark-skinned elf into a tight embrace. He ignored the warm scent of her lust, mustering all the feelings of repentant appreciation he could and pouring them her way. The hug hadn't lasted more than two seconds before Immi resumed her messy flogging with an indignant, high-pitched shriek.

The next few days settled back to contented normalcy for Claire and most of the brood. Of course, that wasn't the case for poor Susan. Understandably tired and emotional, she took several days off work, and they all chipped in as they could to support and keep her company.

The witch was distressed to find that her magic seemed diminished to the point of non-existence, fickle to access. Though she'd never been a particularly strong magic user, having the talent almost entirely revoked was a harsh change to stomach. Of course, the repeated and quite unpredictable emergence of the evil-looking vines didn't help assuage that loss. The sueth-azoah seemed to unconsciously act on her bidding in some very peculiar, startling ways. Despite their best efforts to hide it, it put most of the brood on edge around her. It was just so... unnatural.

Claire couldn't help feeling frightened whenever the dark tendrils shot up out of her skin without warning. It set her dragon's hackles up, reaching for the comfort of her beautiful fire to defend herself with scorching heat.

The first time it happened, they'd all been happily at breakfast. Susan swore it was subconscious, but when she'd pointed to the fruit bowl and asked Petra to pass a banana, they blossomed right out of her arm. Baleful, sturdy, and very fast, they twined weightlessly through the air across a gap of at least three meters to snatch the yellow fruit back to her hand. Stunned silence reigned in the aftermath, all eyes at the table fixed warily on the disbelieving witch. Susan looked up into a sea of mistrustful, frightened faces and fled to her room, mortified.

Chris was phenomenal, Claire thought. He couldn't spare much time away from his work, but it seemed that barely an hour went by without a quiet pop announcing his arrival by Ether. Only staying for a few soft words of reassurance, or a gentle touch before he was gone again. He coaxed her to show him her vines, to embrace and explore the strange new instincts that now bloomed within her. In his words, he was just as devoted as ever to loving her, to have her happy and healthy, weird tentacle shit and all. 

To the dragoness' and the rest of the brood, watching him pamper her in every way he could was like catnip to a bunch of frisky felines.

The smell of arousal was thick in the air, driving him to ever more epic feats of refractory superiority. Notably, Susan didn't receive any of that sort of attention. He seemed to be avoiding her bed for some reason. Claire thought that was a mistake. In combination with Susan's new condition, his reticence embarrassed the witch so that she wouldn't have dared voice any desires she might have had.

This was where his platitudes fell short. It was clear, to his brood at least, that for whatever reason he chose not to be sexually intimate with Susan, it didn't help her emotional recovery at all.

As Annabel had predicted though, he was on Claire like a maddened billygoat. For a few days at least, the fresh knowledge that two of his children grew inside her seemed to drive him into some sort of sex-fever. She actually had to turn him away into the arms of her other broodmates for fear of sparking a mutiny.

Though reluctant to admit it, for a while there, he was so enthusiastic that Claire was left sore by his visits to her bedroom. It was hard to believe he outstripped her ability to self-heal, but even a dragoness needed some respite. At times it seemed like she'd barely dozed off with his warm deposit still seeping lazily out of her before he was back, snuffling, and growling, and prodding at her in his lust. She'd always struggled a little with his size after that fateful transformation. It had been a quiet point of pride that her natural dragon physiology let her please him just the way she was, without an enchantment. She certainly wasn't about to admit that she needed one, when Petra could be heard screaming for more, and harder, through two solid walls. Her mother seemed to accommodate him so... vigorously.

Really, it would have been fine, he was usually so sweet and gentle with her in her human form, unless she asked for something else. Except that in the wake of their joyous discovery he was so damn happy and lustful. Clair found she didn't have the heart to turn him away nearly as much as perhaps she should have.

And it was joyous. Claire embraced the knowledge wholeheartedly now, her beautiful baby girls. They were half the reason he wouldn't leave her be to recover, that much was obvious. She could sense his urgency to flood the three of them, a mother dragon and two babes, with whatever magic they could possibly need to develop safely, perfectly.

His growls in her ear as she shuddered through waves of bliss all but demanded nothing less of her, spurting as he was, powerful and hot, and deep inside.

He was just overdoing it a little, and could she blame her mate for that? Her dragon certainly didn't think so.

After one such glorious bout of lovemaking, he made a surprising declaration. As Claire clutched a glowing crystal between her breasts, draining away some of the electrifying excess, he told her that he had a celebration planned for just the two of them. He wouldn't say more, other than that he wanted to do something special for her in return for doubling his happiness. It was maddening and sweet, typical of her Chris, her mate.

She did worry a little about how hard he was working though. He never complained, but if it wasn't Michelle or Lillian calling him to escort someone, or sit in on a briefing, or undergo training, he doggedly returned to the mysterious construction site.

Something had lit a fire under his cute ass about getting their home finished, and it didn't take a genius to figure out what. More than once though, she noted wryly that he couldn't be getting that much done if he found so many chances to rut with her. His reassurances that their home was very near to completion only increased the demands for information Hailey received, and Claire was as guilty as any other of his brood. Unfortunately, the little blond minx was stoically tight-lipped and hard to track down, deeply engrossed in her own projects.

Over the week, Clair spent much of her spare time researching everything she could about monozygotic pregnancy. Doctor Chang had been correct, she was fortunate her little girls had parted ways so early. Things got progressively more dangerous even after a few days. She went on to read about parenting twins and the challenges involved, a fascinating subject in its own right. Her work was certainly cut out for her as a first-time mom, that was for sure.

With Chris on the sexual warpath, she and Petra refilled a lot of crystals. Reyla's diamond was returned to her by the end of the second day, brimming with renewed, vital magic. Their regular clients were politely screaming for replacements. The days of delayed production from his time in Brazil and the losses to the Syndicate thugs were eventually made up. That was when they discovered another problem, where to stash their growing hoard of treasure? 

In exchange for filled crystals, they mostly accepted good old greenbacks. They were relatively easy to manage, spending at any human store and most magical establishments in the Being district. It was the assorted gold, silver, and precious stones that were starting to accumulate.

Up to that point, Susan had simply been dumping the inconvenient and heavy earnings in an old gym bag in the back of her closet. But with Susan at home, Claire and Petra took over the actual selling and collection down at Eddards, and promptly came across a problem.

Everyone was surprised when Susan directed them to the bag and they found they could barely lift the thing. It had ripped down one of its seams, the treasure within bulging as if to escape something lurking within. The witch admitted to not having looked inside for a while, but she swore up and down they couldn't have taken nearly that much in the short time they'd been selling crystals.

Ever the practical problem solvers, mother and daughter dragon went down to a big box store and purchased a weight scales and a lot of Tupperware, prepared to wade into the treasure in the valiant cause of organisation. In truth, two pregnant dragoness' needed no excuse to tackle the task. They were almost purring audibly at the proximity of such a quantity of precious stones and metals.

They spent a pleasant afternoon together with Susan, sorting, weighing, dividing, and labelling their treasure. It was delightful for the two dragonesses, who had never even come close to such a hoard let alone have it flow through their fingers. The gold especially seemed to sing and resonate to their magic. Petra even admitted, a little sheepishly, that touching it made her mouth water and other parts of her moisten too!

Near the bottom of the bag, they finally found the explanation for their unexpected wealth. Two black-velvet wrapped ounce-bars of dragon-gold had been hidden in there for months! It practically reeked of their mate's energy when separated from the other treasure's insulating, absorbing influence. It had been magically infusing, multiplying their wealth all that time. Petra, of course, had one of the little bars out in a flash, rubbing it against her bare skin with a low grumble of dragon satisfaction.

The culprit, when he showed up from work, was dragged into the other apartment by both dragonesses, and didn't emerge for hours. Given the simultaneous cries of feminine pleasure that emanated from within, his curious brood assumed Chris was being given a special, double-dragoness reward.

Ever the gentleman, Chris gifted his mates the two bars that had inflamed them so creatively. Then he meekly asked if it might be possible to sell some of their regular hoard because he was making himself bankrupt buying construction material and high-end fittings. Petra and Claire called him all sorts of endearing names that belittled his common sense, and of course, agreed.

The entire episode led to an interesting brood council meeting to discuss their finances over a roast lamb leg meal that evening. It was a complicated mess.

Almost everyone had their own bank accounts or small, hidden treasure troves. Chris, through Annabel, had all the while been paying the lion's share of the group's shared expenses such as food and entertainment from his BIA salary. He'd also traded a fair portion of his dragon-gold to Reyla in order to purchase supplies for their new home. That money was now running low again, even after Stephen agreed to work the remainder of the job on barter, in exchange for Chris' magical assistance with future projects.

Claire, Annabel, Petra, and Susan were all for a complete merger of assets. Hailey lent her support to that group when pushed, but said she didn't feel she deserved much say in the matter yet. Her inclusion as a brood member was yet to be consummated, and she had no appreciable assets to contribute. Immi noted cheekily that Hailey had inherited at two rather enviable impressive assets from her mother, much to the group's amusement.

Michelle wished to stay financially independent, quoting career and legal reasons.

The sprite princess didn't know what her standing was with the remaining royalty of her species and therefore didn't want to entangle them with any of that 'stupid fuss' by officially joining the growing movement for merged wealth.

Lillian enigmatically said she couldn't discuss the details of her finances at the moment, but to go ahead and do whatever without her. That got raised eyebrows from everyone. She elaborated, after much prodding, that she was filthy rich and would be open to being convinced to contribute to just about any reasonable outlays the brood required. Michelle took the bait and haggled away her next night with Chris for a tidy fifteen thousand dollars. As everyone else gawked, she laughed that never in her wildest dreams would she have imagined getting paid so much to NOT have sex with someone. Lillian had a similar moment, laughing heartily that she, of all people, would never have thought to pay for sex. Chris just shook his head.

Overall, the issue was left unresolved for the time being. Claire and Annabel agreed to seek advice from someone in the community who had experience in such matters.

That left them with a gym-bag trove to discuss, and its ownership. Chris admitted he had a use for some of it in his slowly progressing runecrafting project, especially the gemstones. He was adamant though that it didn't belong to him, and wasn't his to use or borrow without consent. Several attempts to change his perspective had to be stubbornly weathered before his point of view was grudgingly accepted.

The three crystaleers all thought that was stupid, and that Chris should use what he needed, whenever he wanted. At the least, he should sell whatever it took to finish the house. Lillian also agreed to provide financial aid for the building project, but Annabel put her foot down when the vampire angled toward getting the rights to 'break in the place.'

Susan generously demurred at that point, suggesting that since precious stones and metals were the purview of dragons, and Petra and Claire were so clearly enamoured by them, they should have whatever remained of the hoard.

Touched, the dragonesses accepted, promising Susan that her generosity would be returned two-fold.

Before now, Claire hadn't really developed much of her own hoard outside a nice collection of jewellery. Her father had kept a small chest full of ancient golden coins, she remembered playing amongst them with him as one of her earliest memories. They had been lost when he was killed though, fighting the hunters to secure her safe escape with Petra.

Certainly she'd never owned anything that felt so right, so warm and comforting to her dragon as the small bar of Chris' personal gold. Now she owned a half share in a bulging sports-bag's worth of real treasure, treasure she had helped earn with her mate and broodsisters.

Suddenly rich, happily fuck-tired, pregnant, and loved on all sides, the young dragoness had never felt so content. She gently toyed with the little bar he'd given her that afternoon, smiling softly as it pressed more firmly against her skin. It had found a new home recently, perhaps less productive, but no less appreciated, tucked down the side of her brazier against the softness of her right tit. She just loved the feel of it.

***

"Remind me again why I agreed to be your accomplice in breaking and entering, intimidation, and God knows what else you're going to cook up?" Lisa complained as Chris hopped around the BIA armoury locker room on one huge purple, clawed hybrid foot, trying to pull on a pair of reluctant red santa-pants.

"This is going to be fun. Don't be such a stick in the mud," Kat Jackson stifled a giggle as the dragon crashed sidelong into a locker with an enormous bang that seemed to reverberate around the room.

"Ouch, my wing," Chris groaned as he righted himself, the ruffled appendage twitching fitfully.

Both women burst out laughing, unable to help themselves.

"Come here you big lump," Kat said, ducking under the hazard of a purple wing to kneel beside him and tease his foot through first one leg and then another. "It's your toe-claws, they're catching on the fabric."

Kat stood, beaming a cheeky smile as she handed over the velvety red slacks for him to cinch above his boxer shorts. The fluffy white cuffs looked absolutely ridiculous where they ended, halfway on his bulging, purple calf muscles.

"It tickles." Chris shivered, unused to the sensation of such soft, baggy cloth against his skin. It almost felt like he wasn't wearing anything, then goosed him every time he moved.

"Big baby," Kat smiled, picking up the BIA's largest, custom made kevlar vest out of his locker and slapped it into his chest. "Think you can handle the rest or do you need help putting on all your clothes?"

"Well, of course I need help. It's the pants I thought I could handle," he sighed. "Wings ya' know? Otherwise known as dragon-flappers, sky-flippers, and in my special case, shirt's-bane."

"Fine, turn around." She had to duck under of one of said problematic wings, and its clawed fingertips as he did so. "Slowly! Careful with those things in here, you could take an eye out."

"Sorry! Sorry," Chris said sheepishly, knowing he needed to turn cautiously with his wings out.

"What's the hold up down here?" Michelle asked from the doorway, a little breathless from her hurried dash down three flights of stairs. "I heard a great big crash all the way up on the ground floor."

"The santa suit wasn't cooperating," Chris grinned over his shoulder as Kat began strapping up his vest. It was a tight fit for his wings, but once it was on, their densely muscled fore-limbs slotted into purpose-built holes in the vest's back.

"It was probably the spirit of Saint Nicholas reaching out from the grave to express his disgust," Lisa grumbled as she laced up a pair of sturdy black boots over dark fatigues. "Boss, do I have to wear the elf getup? It's bad enough with just him, do we really need to defile the spirit of Christmas any further with a pair of wicked, pistol-toting elves?"

"Absolutely," Michelle laughed. "It's the elf tunic and hat over your balaclava or I'll find you a pair of angel's wings to wear instead. It amuses me greatly."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 18|
--------------------------------------------
"Unnggrfff!" Lisa let out a wordless cry of frustration and stormed out of the room to collect her pistols.

"What's got her so riled up?" Chris asked furtively as once she was gone.

"Girl hasn't been getting laid since her FBI boyfriend dumped her last week," Kat suggested as she helped slip the loose red shirt around Chris' shoulders and wing joints. An army of safety pins would have to do, closing slits he'd cut for his wings.

"Oh. Who the hell would dump Lisa?"

"An idiot."

"Huh."

"Any problems with this on your end, Kat?" Michelle turned back to them after watching the short brunette storm off. "I know this little mission isn't exactly kosher but..."

"I'm squared away, boss. Haven't gone out for a while, and I understand there's a vampire nightclub involved? And it might actually be fun getting to see Santa here decide who's been naughty or nice."

"I'm afraid your targets have all been quite naughty. Think you can handle that, Santa? Get creative but please don't kill anyone or somehow traumatise any kids you come across."

Chris hurried to strap the fluffy white beard in place around his ears and tug on his floppy cap before turning to reply.

"Yes, Ma'am." He snapped his most comical salute yet, drawing a snicker from Lisa as she returned just in time to catch the absurd scene.

"Okay, that's sort of cute, but I hope you know we're all going straight to hell for this." She stifled her humour as they all smiled at her, attempting to hold onto her sour mood.

"Costumes, elves!" Chris barked commandingly at his two tactically black-clad companions for the evenings.

"A special hell," Lisa muttered rebelliously as she donned the forest green tunic over her body armour, covering any insignia from view.

Michelle smiled indulgently at the merry band. A year ago, if she'd been told she was going to organise something so ridiculous and illegal, she would have laughed. Now she laughed for those very same reasons, it was illegal, ridiculous, and unfortunately necessary.

"Good luck out there, team. I'll be monitoring your targets for any changes in disposition, and I'm always just a phone call away, remember. Be back by two am, or I'll have to suggest that Reyla turn you into pumpkins."

"But she..." Chris grinned at his newest mate's antics.

"Ah, ah, ah. Pumpkins."

"I guess we'd better make a start then."

Ready to depart, Chris held out draconian purple hands to Lisa and Kat. Both women had gotten over their wariness of his abilities by now, so there wasn't any hesitation.

His magic reached to envelop them as they vanished from that plane of existence and into the Ether. There was barely enough time for the women to register the change before they were racing incorporeally toward the northeast. With their patterns magically preserved, their bodies fractured into subatomics to stream toward the dragon's destination through his shadow-filled realm.

They fell through cold, thin air for only a moment. Merging back above a dark, snowy forest. Kat whooped as her stomach dropped away, but Lisa scrabbled to cling to his side. His intention shaped the Ether around them as they fell, the effect propagating into the Norm so their bodies slid safely down into the bottom of a barely perceptible sphere.

"Don't do that, Chris!" The brunette at his side beat at his arm once they were safely on their way out across Lake Michigan. "I need some warning."

Dragon eyes alert for obstacles, Chris brought them in low across the water, passing effortlessly through buffeting snow flurries in the dark. The lake's edge was well lit, homes blanketing the night-shrouded shores with tiny sparks. Chicago's hazy brilliance fell away to the south as they sped onward. Up and over Michigan they raced, skirting north of Detroit and briefly over the border into Canadian airspace before crossing back above Cleveland. They recrossed the water then, hugging the south shore of Lake Erie. Eastward bound now, they flew over land once more to avoid that whole Niagara Falls cluster of settlement. As he cut north once more and slowed, Kat took out her phone and began guiding him in on their destination with a military-grade GPS application.

Even at night, the view over the lake as they alighted atop the wooded-in mansion was exquisite. Crisp snow lay on the ground and perched on bare boughs in a thin sheet. It had stopped falling for now, but the clouds they'd passed on the way threatened more from the west.

The place must be amazing in the warmer months. Chris could wistfully imagine an idyllic summer spent lounging on expansive, perfectly manicured lawns and cooling off by the lake. Heck, if the lake wasn't good enough, there was an enormous pool out back. That was the sort of decadence their first target took for granted on a daily basis.

"There are fifteen damn chimneys," Kat whispered. "This place is fucking huge."

"I know. Michelle says these guys are like the one percent of one percenters," Chris acknowledged in a quiet rumble. "Okay balaclavas and elf hats on please ladies. The last thing we want is you two being identified, that could be a real career ender."

"What about your career?" Lisa frumped halfheartedly in a final attempt to derail the crazy mission.

"I feel sort of bad gloating about it, Lisa, but I've got options. Despite my current appearance, I'm sure I could land a gig at McDonald's, or maybe even a cushy mall security..."

His arm thumped meatily again as it was re-introduced to a small, but well-practised fist.

"Unggg! I hate you," Lisa whisper-hissed as Kat stifled a chuckle on his other side. "At least they'd never let you be Santa again."

"Ouch, workplace harassment. Kat, save me?"

"Okay you two, stop goofing around," the ex-Marine murmured. "Never thought I'd have to act the babysitter when I signed up for this job."

"Alright then," Chris sobered, focusing on the unsavoury task ahead. He didn't want to be out doing this when he could be snuggled up to a warm, soft body. Someone had to shoulder-check the Rikers though. "Follow my lead, I can see really well in the dark. It should just be a matter of standing there and looking menacing really. But I guess if you feel inspired or I'm botching the job, by all means, join the charade. Ready?"

"Yeah," Lisa grumbled quietly as she pulled the thin layer of finely woven dark wool over her face. The hated, pointed green hat went on top, completing the image like a maraschino on a sunday. "I can't believe it, but yeah. No wonder Kevin dumped me, there is too much sneaking around in my new job."

"Fuck him," Kat encouraged softly. "This is probably one of the biggest plates of justice you've served up in your entire career, even if it isn't through the courts. Let's do this."

Chris retook their hands, giving each a gentle squeeze before he pulled the three of them into the Ether once more.

With the harrowing experience at the White House fresh in his memory, he was wary of new territory. For several seconds, he stood stock still, assessing the surrounding landscape. His purple illumination cast the rooftops in an uncanny hue, throwing long half-shadows in the light that never seemed to illuminate as far as it should. Kat and Lisa were just starting to fidget before he was happy that they were more or less safe.

He pulled the three of them down, through the slight resistance of roof, insulation, attic, and ceiling until they stood in a no-doubt richly appointed hallway. Details lost their splendour in the grey scale and bleaching purple permeation.

"That's not right." Lisa was breathing heavily as they settled on their feet, a little yelp escaping her lips when they actually touched firmly rather than sinking through as they'd done before.

"It's all in your head," Chris reassured her. "Well, my head anyway. You're safe here with me, Lisa."

"I know that, but what if you decided we were going to sink into the earth?" She turned her black-masked face to him. "It's fucking weird, alright?"

"Alright," he grinned beneath his fake, fluffy beard, letting go of their hands to make a placating gesture. "I promise I will try to keep the weirdness to a minimum. Now, let's go drop in on Philip."

In a bedroom at the end of one of the mansion's wings, they found their target tucked snugly into bed beside a mature blonde beauty. On their journey through the house, they noted the presence of several other residents. Whether or not they were also members of the Riker family, they weren't sure, but there was no doubt that this was the head of the household. They came out of the Ether like silent, Christmas wraiths, ready to deliver dark tidings to the man on Michelle's naughty list.

The bedroom was vast, boasting a view of the lake on one side, and the sprawling garden and pool on the other. Chris took a few moments to stare down at the peacefully snoring old man before the show truly started. His subject was lean, grey hair seeming to somehow retain a dignified pose despite the down pillow's best efforts. 

As Chris stood over the bed, he heard his backup team quietly taking positions by the door, and overlooking the window which was providing most of their dim illumination. The blonde, he assumed Philip's wife, Vanessa, had a fetching grace about her features. She must have been stunning in her prime and was probably a good decade or more younger than her husband. Her sleeping brow was pinched into a fretful furrow, perhaps sensing the proximity of danger.

Chris wasn't thrilled about her presence, but if she heard the warning he was about to deliver too, maybe her husband would have a harder time ignoring it. That would be to both their benefits.

Indeed, Vanessa must have somehow sensed the scrutiny of the malevolent nighttime visitor because her eyelids slowly fluttered open. Confused for a moment, they grew wide as she saw the red and white clad giant looming above her, lit only by dim light spilling in from the dark window.

"I know I'm a little early, Vanesssssa," Chris channelled the dragon's deep rumble, doing nothing to fight the sibilance from his split tongue and sharpened teeth. "But I'm here to spread the season's tidingsss to your husband. We don't want him getting a switch from me this Chrissstmassss, do we?"

He saw the exact moment she realised he wasn't human. With the yellowish light trickling in from the garden fixtures outside, intent eyes darted to his wings, to the purple hands sticking out of his santa suit.

There was no scream, no hint of existential crisis on her quickly composed face. She knew. Chris was gratified that his senses let him see she wasn't entirely stone-cold. Her hand was trembling slightly as she reached to shake her husband awake. The scent reaching his nose becoming richer with fear and the first hints of sweat. She was scared alright, but she hid it well.

Her husband mumbled a wordless protest as she prodded him, turning his head deeper into the warmth of the pillow. Vanessa was loath to take her eyes of the huge creature-santa-thing to wake him, silently cursing whatever scheme he'd gotten involved in that brought something like this crawling out of the woodwork and into their bedroom in the middle of the night. Vanessa found her husband's ear and twisted vindictively.

"Wake up, Philip. You have a visitor."

"Ouch, woman!" Philip shot up with a cry of pain, unwittingly making the dragon take a step away from the bed so he wasn't headbutted in the chest. "A visitor? Who? What time is it?"

"Why don't you ask him?" she pointed, pulling her nightgown tighter around her as she shuffled back against the oak headboard.

"Why don't I... oh... fuck me," Philip's voice trailed off as he saw their bedroom guest.

"Hello, Philip," Chris smiled toothily, though the effect was probably lost in the tickly curls of his ridiculous white beard. He let his wings twitch, extending ominously to about half-width before settling with a dry, leathery rustle of tiny scales. "Tell me. Which of my lists do you think your name is on... naughty or nice?"

"Jesus Christ, you're one of them!" Philip scuttled backward on the bed, trying to organise his mind into something resembling composure. It settled on old, comfortable routines, drilled into permanent memory by years spent sparring across the negotiation table or the aisle of a courtroom. "I... I don't know who or what you think you are, breaking into my house in the middle of the night, but you're in a world of trouble, buddy. If you lay a hand on us there will be serious repercussions, I know some very powerful people. Besides, don't you folks have rules against showing yourselves to good, honest people?"

Chris chuckled, so he wasn't going to crumble easily.

"Philip, Philip, Philip," Chris turned and sat casually on the side of the bed, close enough to maintain the immediate threat. "You are neither good nor honest. This is disappointing. Why would I get in trouble for showing myself when you are obviously so well informed already? I'm just here to deliver a message, there's no need to..."

"Listen, Pal! If you want to get a message to me, pick up the damn phone," Philip was finding his breath now, channelling his indignation at being so rudely awoken. Channelling some fear too, if he was honest. "Break into my home dressed as Santa Clause, will you? Well, that's a big mistake, you don't want to mess with my family. We have the sort of connections you couldn't begin to comprehend! Hell, we're the fucking foundation of this nation, and we own a good chunk of it! I will personally see you locked up or buried unless you're out of my..."

"Philip, stop running your big mouth before you get us killed!" Vanessa was gobsmacked at her husband's temerity.

Couldn't he feel the danger this winged man represented? For starters he was huge. His purple hands looked like they could crush her skull like an egg if they didn't tear her to shreds with their short talons. It was all very well to plot or use those connections her husband spoke of if it was necessary, but not while they were actually at his mercy. Here was their first real encounter with a wild Being, capable of who-knew-what and her husband fell back on threats and bluster.

"I'd listen to your wife, Phil," Chris hid his awoken rage behind a steel-hardened, controlled voice. The man wasn't lying about his connections or wealth and willingness to use them. That was the problem. "I've already been on the receiving end of your family's morally bankrupt idea of acceptable behaviour, that's why I'm here. Did your brother, Patrick, tell you about how he hired thugs to kidnap me at gunpoint? How his men shot one of my mates in the head with a suppressed rifle? How he planned to keep me sedated indefinitely for his lab rats to gnaw at?"

"Oh God, you're... him," Vanessa's hands reached to cover her mouth, sure now that they were about to be executed.

"Who?" Chris sneered. "The one who finally raised enough red flags to shut you down? It's not like mine was an isolated case."

"Look... damn it. Look, I didn't agree with Patrick's actio..."

"You didn't stop him!" The dragon roared, lunging forward into the man's face. At a concerned throat clearing from Lisa, he lowered his voice.

Vanessa squeaked, realising for the first time that there were more people lurking in the shadows.

"Which jail do I find him in?" Chris continued more reservedly, but with no less venom in his voice. His fangs tingled in an entirely new way now, preparing a dose of life-ending toxins for this worm of a creature. "Where is he serving his multi-lifetime sentence for kidnapping and attempted murder, Philip? You're in charge of this substantial empire, did you at least cut his access to your family's funds and resources?"

"Well..." Philip's heart was pounding as the dragon's strange eyes bored into him at close range. He could have cursed his brother at that moment. "It's not that simple. I..."

"Save it," Chris sighed, leaning back. He stood and walking over to look out the big window in an attempt to calm down. He was too involved, they needed to bounce on out of here soon, especially after shouting like that. "Save your bullshit justifications and your privilege. I caught up with Patrick in Sardinia. After a little convincing, he agreed to disappear, to not cause any more trouble for your family or mine."

There was silence behind him, and Chris wondered if he'd overplayed his hand in front of Kat and Lisa. The implication of Patrick's murder was certainly there between the lines. He couldn't worry about that just now, perhaps they would understand. No, not Lisa anyway.

Momentarily distracted by that worry, his mind wandered to the scene below the window, the backyard garden and frigid pool. An interesting idea was born, drawing him back to the present situation. Outside, one of his dark orbs materialised effortlessly.

"Your brother was quite helpful actually," Chris turned back to his audience with renewed purpose. "Magic is such a wonderful thing, sometimes I really think we should all take a dose of truth syrup with breakfast every morning. The world would be a very different place. Anyway, I've gone and gotten distracted when I was really here to deliver a simple message."

"Which is?"

"I have my eye on your family and your rich friends, Philip Riker. My people are in your finances, in your emails and private servers. Patrick gave us everything. This is your one chance to clean up your act and back away from Beings peacefully."

"You're threatening me?" the old emperor growled when his domain was in jeopardy. "You've just admitted to enough to put you away for decades."

"That's the thing, Phil. You and your ilk aren't playing by the rules, are you? Why should you get to fall back to that protection when it suits? It boils down to this. If I catch another whiff of your family or companies stepping out, acting on knowledge they shouldn't have, or even general douche-baggery, I will rain magical hell down on it all. I will start dismantling industrial facilities. There will be mysterious, expensive accidents, equipment and industrial plant will vanish overnight. I'll damage property until your insurers run for the hills and your employees scream that they can't come into work. And most importantly, I will hold you personally responsible for it, Philip, for all of your substantial empire."

"Now hold on just a minute, I can't be held responsible for the actions of an incorporated company. That's just not how it works!"

"Try. Me," Chris spat disdainfully. "Who are you going to run crying to? What's more, after the Revelation I will do my best to make sure you don't get the access to the magic you've already started to plan for. I will start shouting how your brother kidnapped little werewolf kids to run sick experiments on under your watch. How many witches will agree to work with your pharmaceutical interest then?"

"Alright, I get the point, dammit," Philip ground out through his teeth, seething with impotent anger.

"I can see you're not getting the message. You probably think you're going to make a few phone calls after I'm gone and I'll cease being a problem." Chris shook his head sadly as a tick in the man's reddened cheek suggested that was exactly what he'd planned. "It's not a good idea. You've been moving your chess pieces around here and there, dipping your toes into the magical world and assuming it's all business as usual. It's not. It's a mistake to think you can hide behind lawyers and money when there's a vengeful pack of werewolves after your family. A vengeful pair of dragons, a vampire, a sprite, a witch, and an Annabel will be far worse. Talk some sense into him, would you Vanessa?"

"I'll... I'll try," the quiet woman nodded. She put a restraining hand on her husband's shoulder but it was shrugged away.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Oh, and stop shorting the stock market. The Revelation is going to be hard enough without you trying to profit on everyone else's chaos and upset." Chris knew he was getting carried away again now but he couldn't help it. "Spread the word amongst all your insider-trading circle-jerkers on that. Besides, it's just dumb to think people won't be looking for that shit afterwards. Pay your damn share of taxes while you're at it too, no wonder there's a huge deficit. For fuck's sake man, look around. You. Have. Enough. Money."

"You're done? Is that all?"

Chris' eyes narrowed dangerously. He wanted to tear off the stupid beard and hat and scream at the stubborn man.

"No actually, I was hoping you were smart enough to take a hint without needing a demonstration. I guess not." He glanced to Kat and Lisa, stoic as ever, and held out his hands. As they came to him in the dark, he pulled them close and extended his wings protectively above their heads.

With a rasping, creaking shriek of splintering wood and crumbling masonry, his orb bit into the side of the bedroom. Chris coaxed its bloated, two-meter diameter slowly into the room, not wanting to have the roof collapse or dangerous chunks go flying off in any direction. It also had the added benefit letting him watch the uncertainty on his audience's face grow to apprehension, and finally terror.

It floated ominously over the end of the bed, black and terrible to the uninitiated. Vanessa whimpered, glancing between it and the perfectly round hole in her bedroom wall that was now letting the bitterly cold night air tear at her nightgown.

Feeling vindictive, Chris let it trail through the bedding and mattress, consuming everything in its path. It advanced on them to the discordant sound of pinging springs. Worrying that they might try to bolt or touch the orb, Chris pulled it back a little, letting them see what it had done.

"What are you doing man! Stop it!" Philip's voice finally had a satisfying note of fright in it. "I'll do it! Jesus Christ, I'll do it!"

"I'll keep you to that, Philip. Just remember, next time it will be half the lake, from a few hundred feet up."

"W..What?!"

Chris dropped his hold on that locus of Ether in his mind's eye. A four-ton sphere of freezing pool water and the atomised remnants of a wall seemed to hang in mid-air for a timeless moment. Then it fell, crashing into the remnants of the bed and dispersing in a miniature tidal wave. The terrified pair were caught up and swept, spluttering and bedraggled onto the floor.

"Ho, ho, ho!" Chris bellowed for all the house to hear, pulling his elves into the Ether right before the frigid torrent could splash onto their feet.

Vanessa and Philip Riker were left gasping, shivering, and wiping their eyes clear in their flooded, ruined bedroom. Finding themselves inexplicably alone, they quickly broke into a heated argument until the cold wind blowing through the gaping hole drove them splashing to wake the household and find a warm shower.

Philip was, understandably in his mind but apparently not in his wife's, hopping mad. The confrontation with the Being left him uncharacteristically shaken, and disgusted for it. He was used to respect and deference from all sides, especially from those who actually understood his incalculable wealth. He was supposed to be untouchable, beyond rich and with the connections to do just about anything if he was smart. How dare some kid from Denver come into his house and pull a stunt like that.

Oh, he knew all about Christopher Baryst. It was too bad his brother had acted on that half-cooked tip before they'd gotten the full picture about the young dragon. He never would have agreed to that course of action if he'd know the risks, if he'd known the kid was already working with the government.

If Patrick had truly spilled the beans like the dragon claimed, it was bad, bad news. Come to think of it, he hadn't heard from his overly ambitious brother in a while.

It wasn't until he was once more dressed, overseeing his bleary-eyed staff as they attempted to mop up the flooding, that he realised the validity of the dragon's threat. It was their half curious, half fearful glances that did it. These were good, subservient people who had worked for his family for decades. Suddenly, they were looking at him for answers he couldn't rightly give. He would sound like he'd gone mad if he said a dragon broke in, threatened him, and somehow dumped half his pool through a perfect hole in the wall. 

Extrapolating, his frown deepened. He realised that in the back of his mind he been assuming he would call the local sheriff, whose campaign he donated very generously to, get him down here to look at the damage, and point him in Chris' direction. But that was dumb, only raising more unanswerable questions from people who wouldn't keep their mouths shut.

Shit, what were the contractors going to say when they came to patch up the wall? He would have to get a team of specialists out from New York to repair the damage, that would be expensive. You didn't get as rich as he was without inheriting a well-established dynasty or two, and then being miserly for most of your life.

Finally, he'd caught a glimpse of the dragon's threat and it was a doozy. His family's holdings were truly vast. There was no way he could hope to defend them from the sort of industrial sabotage he'd been threatened with. Factories, mines, and distribution centres were prohibitively expensive if they had to be shut down for repairs.

And who would he complain to? The AG? The President? His brother's actions and subsequent flight had already put him on the shit list with just about everyone who was politically invested in the Revelation. He might have the political clout to make the dragon's life somehow uncomfortable, but not without coming off as petty and vindictive. No, it would burn too many bridges and paint a bullseye on himself for more magical bullshit.

That left him essentially two options. Hire a few professionals to take care of the problem for good, or buckle down and make his family actually behave themselves. He knew which he wanted to choose, but it wasn't the smart choice. There was too much risk, too much exposure, and too much chance of failure. The other was essentially a slap on the wrist, and back to business as usual.

He smiled wickedly when he realised that. It was the same damn deal they always gave his ilk after misbehaving. Magic be damned, Philip Riker was still fucking untouchable.

Chris, Lisa, and Kat still planned to visit three other individuals of dubious character before they retired to avoid the pumpkin-curfew.

With the head of the Riker family behind them, Chris' concern was that their upcoming hunt in New York would upset some local Being. He was probably supposed to register his activity with the relevant territory lords or their representatives in the cities they visited, but that would have taken so long. Paperwork and meet-and-greets sounded like a terrible idea to Chris. Essentially announcing his business to everyone in the process seemed worse.

Better to ask forgiveness afterward. So the three of them slunk down-state toward the diffuse glow in the sky, relying on Chris' speed to keep them ahead of any prying magical eyes.

Katherine rode motorcycles, and it seemed that racing around the night sky in a magical construct fulfilled at least some of the same rush. She was almost as exuberant as a kid let out trick or treating for the first time. Lisa wasn't particularly happy with him after his little spat with the head of the Riker family, but she warmed back up during their second stop.

They caught up with Damian Goodall in his Upper East Side apartment. As the holder of one of Patrick's supposed insurance policies, Michelle was keen to keep him silent. The Riker family's fixer-lawyer was also their go-between for most things magical, that didn't come from their government connections anyway. Somehow, this resourceful lawyer had stumbled across Roman, a younger vampire who dabbled in high-end drug dealing and apparently a little info-brokering.

Damian didn't take much convincing to see the merits of their point of view. It might have had something to do with the two lines of Colombia's finest they found him inhaling on his kitchen bench, in preparation for an evening of clubbing.

It was so easy, Chris thought it was almost unsporting. With only a yuletide-themed implication of a good old-fashioned defenestration, he was a convert.

Perhaps his existing contact with Beings preconditioned him to quick acquiescence. Maybe it was the general insanity of Christmas cheer which accompanied every syllable of Chris' address this time, an attempt on the dragon's part to dispel the cloud hanging over Lisa's pointy green hat. 

Whatever the case, Damian declined to step into thin air for a ride in Santa's sleigh, despite assurances from the two helpful elves that it really was there and simply an invisible sleigh. Everyone knew that, didn't they? How else was good St. Nick supposed to get around in this day and age of cellphone cameras? Chris would be grading Kat's performance down for the evil snicker she couldn't contain toward the end.

Almost as an afterthought, they mentioned the tens of millions of dollars owed to the IRS that Michelle had uncovered. The man had a gift with tax evasion, and neither he nor the Rikers were squeamish about the morality of his skillset. Combined with the threat to refer his suspect finances and lifestyle to the relevant authorities, it made for a compelling argument. Damian Goodall was left a reformed and very confused man.

Through one of Lillian's contacts, they next caught up with Roman at a private party barely more than ten blocks away. Business must have been booming for the vampire, the evidence of rich youngsters icing their noses was scattered all around the huge penthouse suite. Some were obviously underage and drinking, or smoking, or dancing the night away under the influence of something.

Chris felt suddenly very mature in the presence of his age-peers. They dabbled their little brains away, but here he was at nineteen, out tracking down high-end low-lives for his evening fun. He worried about Susan all the while, but they partied on like the sun wasn't going to come up in a few short hours. Perhaps it was his sheltered country upbringing or his imminent fatherhood, but he realised the world was forcing him to grow up quickly.

These kids clearly lived in a different magical world to his. It was a world where they were kept sheltered from the serious worries of everyday life by vast sums and family lawyers. He had to admit, with its nubile bodies, thumping music, and carefree spirit, this party had its own certain enticing charm.

It was the most potentially dangerous of their meetings for Lisa and Kat, so they were cautious. Together, the three observed the goings on of the party from the safety of the Ether. There was some sort of unusual arrangement with Roman, the dealer. He seemed to be holding, handling, and dispensing to the revellers on demand. There wasn't an exchange of money, he just rolled joints or produced pills and gave them away. Lisa seemed to think it must be some sort of drugs as a service scheme, where the vampire was paid in advance to show up with a cocktail of illegal delights. It was quite clever actually, none of the party-goers ever had to handle quantities or exchange currency.

Roman's services were in demand, so it was a while before they found their chance. He exited a bedroom where he'd been administering some sort of hedonistic ritual of intoxicated debauchery. Pungent smoke billowed out when the door opened to disgorge him and his satchel of party favours. In the temporarily deserted hallway, the vampire actually squeaked when a heavy hand landed on his neck from behind. His startled cry was cut short as he was dragged into the Ether.

Lisa was standing back, ready to support with drawn pistol if necessary. Kat almost bounced at Chris' side with her nightstick in one hand and a small silver ingot gripped tightly in her other fist. Chris was prepared to fight a Lillian-strong opponent into submission.

Roman did put up a few seconds of valiant squirming but Chris was astonished by the difference a few extra centuries made to a vampire's strength. Despite his sinuous, wiry physique the guy was a comparative pipsqueak next to what the dragon was used to from his undead mate. That was a lesson well learned if he ever squared off against a vampire older than Lillian. He would hate to have to fight Vlad, or heaven forbid, ancient Asha.

Chris sort of felt bad for the pleading vampire as he phased the four of them to another, even more exclusive part of the city. This time, they didn't have to worry about skulking in the Ether to hide his appearance. The place was protected by the most powerful normalising-charms he'd come across. Even out on the sidewalk, they hung thick in the chill night air, suggesting to the non-magical passersby that they rationalize away any dragons, fake elves, or kidnapped vampires. He banged loudly on a thick steel door and they were admitted downstairs into the den of one of Lillian's 'friends.'

From the picture Lillian had painted, New York was some sort of vampire haven. The abundant nightlife and condensed population made for ample hunting grounds. But it was like an estuary full of young spawn. Lillian said that anyone with more than a few centuries under their belt would be driven mad by the constant squabbling and move elsewhere for some peace and quiet. 

She'd also made some sort of jibe in her endearing accent about recognising a kindred spirit in her friend Jason, who was one of the older of her kind in the city. Naturally, that maddening comment had gone unexplained.

Chris almost had to get intimate with the burly werecat doorman for them to squeeze past each other in the tight, dark hallway. The wings didn't help, but they ended up exchanging friendly grunts and even a little nod of solidarity. Just two muscle-bound magic-dudes out to make an honest living, like ships passing in the night.

After a brief renewal of struggling at the entrance, their prisoner went quiet as they walked toward the red light and languid notes oozing around the corner next to the coat-check. Lisa reluctantly handed over her pistols to another bouncer. Kat couldn't keep her silver, for her own safety, but was strangely allowed the baton.

Their party was soon ushered inside, to a little world of debauchery, blood, and sex no regular citizen would ever suspect was harboured under their feet. The lights inside were very dim, casting everything in cliche tones of deep red.

"What was it with vampires and clubs?" Chris wondered, muttering to himself as he frog-marched their captive to meet his new host.

There were a few patrons standing around a huge, well-appointed bar that wrapped all the way around the back of the intimate space. Chris suspected the structure might have once been a small movie theatre in the days before screen size became the end all and be all. Down two side-aisles of stairs, four descending tiers of screened booths faced a curtained stage. Currently empty for the moment, it was the clear focus of the amphitheatre-like structure.

On closer inspection, the folks at the bar were sipping something red from crystal goblets. Yep, real blood, real goblets, and they were looking his way with keen interest. For a fearful moment, he wondered if Lillian had accidentally led him to the slaughter in trusting her friend. But there were humans here too, he could smell them. Most of the clientele appeared to already be seated in the screened booths. By the anticipatory note of the merged conversation that reached him above sensuous background music, they were excited about something.

It was some sort of sex club he realised. The approaching dominatrix-waitress in skintight red leather gave it away as she carried a tray of empty glasses up the stairs from a lower tier. Her masked outfit would have been an indecent display of her lush charms even if it wasn't for the cutouts for her eyes, nose, mouth, and crotch. She was small, curvy, and completely shorn downstairs.

Her confident saunter slowed as she reached their level. An initially speculative scenting of the air currents turned downright predatory as she caught wind of him.

"Mmmhhh, one of you smells just divine," the seductress husked, flashing a pair of very real white fangs as she sat her tray down on the bar. "Is that you, Santa? Why don't you ditch these two? I'll be the naughtiest little elf you've ever dreamed of."

Chris was in trouble. Behind the curvy vampire, he saw two more of her kind take notice of their fellow waitress' new toy. With preternatural hearing, their heads shot up out of booths where they'd been taking care of customers. To his surprise it was Kat who came to his rescue, boldly stepping between him and the diminutive, red-clad daemonette.

"Sister, I've seen what Santa here is carrying around in his sack," she sneered knowingly. "Trust me, it's more than you can handle. So why don't you run along and find us a seat and some drinks while you're at it, we're here to see someone named Jason."

Chris' eyes went wide, he almost released Roman in preparation to defend Kat, but the vampire snorted after a few shocked seconds. It transformed into a hearty laugh, which turned a few heads around the joint.

"Oh, you're good, yes indeed. But I'm afraid everyone's here to see Jason, sweetheart, you'll have to wait until the show's all finished. You're in luck though, it's almost time and we've got just the booth set aside. Come find me in a few years when the wrinkles start setting in, elfy, I might just consider letting you join our little club. Certainly got the attitude for it. And as for you, Santa, the offer stands, but I know better than to take a nibble of someone else's lunch without permission. Especially Lillian's. You can call me Red."

"Ahh... okay. Thanks, Red," Chris managed, all the while wondering what the hell Lillian had set him up for. He became suspicious when they were led to a roped-off booth that must have had the best view in the house.

The fight had truly gone out of their drug-dealing captive, Roman seemed resigned to his fate now. He sulked on the other side of the circular booth from the three. Red came back to serve them drinks in a few moments, on the house of course.

Chris and Lisa didn't want anything but Kat ordered their finest scotch, just to be contrary. Roman finally spoke up and told Red to bring the bottle to the table. The unabashed vampire shot him a disgusted, hateful look. The bottle did show up though, and it certainly had enough stags, rocky, windswept outcrops, and other Scottish cliches to count itself fine.

The two other waitresses lurked, making excuses to strut past their booth or linger nearby until Red scolded them. If Chris needed to guess, he would have wagered their names were Black and Pink by their outfits. They weren't anything similar to Red's other than being monochromatic, masked, and incredibly saucy.

Black was a tall, pale goddess with flowing midnight hair and a slightly stern mouth. She wore a contraption of dark gauze which screened, but ultimately hid nothing of her slim beauty. Her only true concealment seemed to come from the feather mask which covered the top half of her face.

Compared to the other two, Pink was displaying herself quite bashfully where it counted. Her lithe body and modest curves were adorned with only a string bikini set. It was very skimpy, the colour matching her namesake, but at least her privates weren't on display. Caramel skinned and athletic, she seemed the most youthful of the trio.

Clearly susceptible to the draw of his blood, her fanglets smeared dark lipstick in anticipation as hungry eyes repeatedly lingered longingly in his direction. The danger of her losing control must have been real, because whenever she flounced past or stuck her chin over the top of their booth to stare down, Red seemed to tense.

As they sat nervously waiting, Chris' keen senses took in more details of the strange establishment. The back wall displayed all sorts of harnesses, ropes, and sexual aids. There was also a door down by the stage from which people would sometimes issue or enter. The trickle of people was mostly made up of couples. They tended to be coming out tired yet flushed with whatever activity went on down there.

"We like to call it the playground," Red simpered in his ear, noticing his interest. "All sorts of wicked things could be going on down there. Who knows? I understand we'll be trying to find a role down there for your miscreant friend, keep him out of trouble for a while?"

Roman seemed to perk up a little at that, his second helping of whiskey pausing on its way to his lips.

"Something like that," Chris said, doing his damnedest not to let the strange vampire's proximity to his neck unsettle him too visibly. Lillian had been reluctant to divulge details other than a reassurance that he wouldn't be summarily executed once he was handed over.

"I suppose he might have some potential," Black chimed in on the conversation. "A diet of bored, high society New York housewife and a little education on the proper ways of vampirism could do wonders for the little traitor."

"I'm no traitor," Roman growled back.

"Is that so, my little rat?" Red's purr was dangerous. "And what would you call skittering around collecting whispers about Santa here to sell to your rich human friends? Hmm? Let's not even mention that poor, strung out psyker you've been feeding poison to. You very nearly got our dear friend Lillian killed. She's been very generous to refer you to us instead of pegging you out to greet the dawn."

"Squeak up," Black teased from the sidelines.

Roman didn't have a reply, his silence and downcast eyes were probably a wise choice.

The little reminder about his costume now made Chris feel ridiculous. What had started as a joke between he and Michelle now had him sitting in a sex dungeon dressed as Santa. The damn beard itched and tickled his skin too. He didn't have time to ponder it longer though because the music swelled and then ebbed into the background. All of a sudden, the stage's black curtain was drawing back.

"Now you'll get to see Jason play," the leatherbound vampire said as the audience hushed. "I almost wish it was my turn tonight but I wouldn't pass up the honour of hosting you. Enjoy the show."

A slowly rotating bedspread was revealed as powerful lights brightened to illuminate the four occupants. Two more colour-coded seductresses, Blue and White, lay on either side of their young plaything. She was a beauty, lean and ripe with the perky bloom of womanhood. Her skin was snowy-pale, freckled here and there, and pink with arousal in all the right places. Long blonde hair splayed around her and the teasing vampires like a golden braided river, a healthy patch adorning the top of her engorged mons.

Beside the low bed, a tall African American man looked down approvingly as Blue kissed at the young woman's neck and toyed with a dawn-tinted nipple. Amplified by a boom microphone lowered from the rigging, the woman's ragged moan made Chris' cock twitch as the platform rotated her already-glistening sex into view.

It appeared he wasn't the only one who appreciated the sight. The dark, sculpted man, Chris assumed Jason, was swelling into his full and considerable endowment. White reached out a paradoxically dark-skinned hand to test the waters of their toy's arousal. She collected a sample, drawing out a few more lustful cries before rolling over to introduce the glisting fluid to the throbbing crown of Jason's proud erection.

Beside them at the booth, Black seemed to quiver with barely contained excitement as the man prowled across the bed to mount the young woman. Something about her reaction clicked for Chris, and he finally understood Lillian's little joke. The colours weren't just sultry waitresses, they were all Jason's.

"I really wasn't prepared for anything like this," Lisa breathed, the thin balaclava was suddenly stifling despite the comfortably cool air. It was like a sexy car-wreck, she felt she shouldn't be watching, but at the same time couldn't look away. There was nowhere else for her eyes to reasonably wander.

"Best night ever," Kat watched avidly beside her as the young woman was worked to a state of tortured readiness.

"She's human you know," Red taunted the marine. "That could be you and me up there with him."

With a showman's skill, Jason slid his thick knob between her puffy folds. At just the right moment for the audience to get the best view of their tight coupling, he groaned and sank deep into the saddle of her upturned hips.

What followed was twenty enlightening minutes of debauchery. There was no doubt that it was a show. Like pornography, the three vampires positioned their bodies for maximum visibility and showmanship rather than optimal experience. That didn't seem to put Jason off his game. He coaxed all three women to shuddering, full-bodied pleasure with effortless mastery, openly sampling their blood in the process.

Sitting there with a dry mouth and an uncomfortably erect problem to restrain, Chris thought he picked out at least half a dozen new tricks to take home. Perhaps that was what Lillian intended.

As the lights finally dimmed and the curtain obscured the sharing of three cum-streaked pairs of marvellous breasts, the audience began clapping enthusiastically.

Chris was left wondering how much of what he'd seen was orchestrated for him. It seemed unlikely that the show was set to occur minutes after their arrival, and that a prime booth was set aside. Was it some sort of vampire power play? He was left off balance, and his lingering erection only heightened his discomfort.

"I'm so sorry, I truly had no idea we were in for anything like this," Chris turned to a smiling Kat and saucer-eyed Lisa, concealed behind their elf getups. At least they shared that humiliation, he thought belatedly. "I'm going to throttle Lillian when I get home."

"You could try, but she might enjoy it," a deep voice approached from over his shoulder. It was the man from the stage, of course, dressed in nothing but a black silk robe and a self-satisfied grin. He stuck out a hand to shake as he reached their booth, a hand whose fingers had been thoroughly ensconced in Blue's womanhood just minutes ago. "Jason. It's nice to finally meet the man behind the rumours, Chris."

Chris' eyes narrowed as he realised he was being forced to stand in order to accept the man's introduction. His hesitation only seemed to make the vampire's grin widen, so Chris threw his dignity to the wind and stood. His state of obvious arousal drew a shocked gasp from Lisa, but more worryingly a throaty growl from Black.

"Yeah, nice to meet you too, Jason. That was quite some performance," Chris shook firmly, ignoring the red, Christmas-themed tent pointing up between them. Damn those velvety pants, they did absolutely nothing to mitigate his problem. Right then, he could have killed for a pair of denims. "All good rumours, I hope."

"Thank you, I'm glad you found it so... invigorating."

Chris chuckled darkly, he was in a vampire's dick measuring contest alright. Well, when in Rome. He stood straighter, forcing his hips out a little to make Jason take a half-step back or risk a prodding.

"You're a lucky man, Jason, there's no doubt." Chris was unreasonably satisfied to note that he was at least a few inches taller, not counting his towering wings. The rainbow of vampires had all somehow assembled themselves, watching avidly as the master of their harem faced down the hulking dragon. Chris was more than a little annoyed now. He hadn't signed on for any of this but knew just the thing to barb them in return.

"Listen, that was all very educational, but I can't really stay to chat. We've got more stops to make, bad guys to quash. Lillian told you the story, right?"

"Indeed. We'll see that this lost little sheep doesn't cause any more trouble before the Revelation," Jason's smile faltered as he glanced past Chris to the others at the table. "My those are some sweet-smelling helpers you have there, they seem very excited. Are you sure we can't convince you to stay a little longer? Pink is just dying to play."

"I'm afraid not," Chris clapped a companionable hand on the man's shoulder as if nothing about this situation was out of the norm for him. He glanced around, briefly meeting the masked eyes of each member of Jason's harem as he constructed his excuse. "Lillian is waiting up at home for me. She demands a lot of attention, I think it's something to do with the pregnancy you know? Imagine beautiful Red here, twice as amorous and three times as hungry as her tummy swells. That would be something, wouldn't it? I'll tell you though, Jason, it's all worth it. There's nothing quite like the feeling of sharing something so special, so intimate with a loved one."

Not all of them reacted as he might have hoped, but Blue's yearning sigh and scent or Red's spiking arousal were enough for Chris' vindictive streak.

"Mmm, that does sound enjoyable. The mind boggles," Jason replied, his wistful tone making Chris suddenly feel like a cad for pointing out the deficiency of their vampirism. "Well, if you have to run away, please take our regards to Lillian. You two must stop by for a night or two after the Revelation. The girls have been hatching all sorts of plans for when we don't have to hide ourselves. A performance from the two of you would be the event of the year in our little circle."

"A performance?! Like that one we just..." All his bravado was undone in a stammering second. "I'm not sure I... I hadn't even considered something like that. Sorry, you surprised me. I'm not sure, Jason, I'd have to give it some serious thought."

"You do that, Christopher." Jason's smile was back in full force as he ushered them toward the exit.

"And bring the fun elf with you," Red called melodically behind them as five beautiful vampires closed in on Roman, their new plaything.

As they retrieved Lisa's weapons and walked back up the corridor out onto the deserted sidewalk, Chris was pensive. He understood that his elaborate intervention with Roman was orchestrated the way it was for political reasons. Something to do with stepping on the fewest number of local toes according to Lillian. What he couldn't get was what her game was in sending him to a place like that without prior warning. With Lisa and Kat under his care, and factoring in exposure to young and unpredictable vampires, it seemed risky.

"I really am sorry," he explained to his pair of minders as they reached the deserted sidewalk. "That whole thing was so strange I can barely believe it happened at all. I'd be eternally grateful if it wasn't brought up around the office at work, but I guess I'd have to understand if it surfaced."

"It's going to be pretty hard to contain," Kat smiled. "I mean, I'm pretty sure I got offered immortality and a position in a vampire stud's stable of hoes. And damn, he was put together right! That thing he did where his..."

"That's enough!" Lisa rounded on her. "I know you're new at this but you need to work on your professionalism. It was a very unusual situation in there, but you were way too carefree. This isn't a night out on the town, Kat. In some ways, I think we were lucky to make it out of there unscathed. That pink one especially was a hair's breadth from going off the rails and the place was absolutely packed with bloodsuckers."

Chris noticed that Kat seemed to unconsciously slip into a stiff posture during the reprimand, hands crossed behind her back with eyes locked dead ahead. Perhaps the whiskey had gone to her head because after Lisa was finishing, she struggled to withhold a giggle.

"What's so funny!"

"Paahahaha!" Kat burst. "Jason can scathe me however he wants after watching that! Besides, I don't think we were in much real danger. Chris could have dragoned-out if things went goat-fuck. "

Lisa looked up at Chris, shrugging with outstretched arms as if to say that she'd tried her best.

He took their hands again, hoping to forestall any taking of sides by delivering them to their last target for the evening.

They jumped to Harrisburg as a shortcut on their way to Baltimore. Chris could still picture the sight of Radek's attack on the NSA facility well enough to teleport them safely. It brought back memories that he hadn't revisited in a while, his trip to Scotland, meeting Michelle for the first time. Come to think of it, he'd performed his first jump from this exact site, driven by fear and the need to escape the corrupted wizard. He'd come a long way since then.

All the night's magical exertion was definitely catching up to him as they flew low toward the lights of the city. Chris didn't know if he was up for another rollercoaster ride tonight. Thankfully, he needn't have worried.

Despite the late hour, Benjamin Riker was up and reading a financial report in a leather armchair. Part of a younger generation than Patrick or Philip, Michelle said he was being groomed to be the successor of the dynasty. As such, he most definitely knew about Beings.

Thankfully, merit was taken into account when selecting for such a position. He was only Philip's cousin, but his aptitude in management, law, and most importantly politics put him ahead of the pack. As such, he was in the loop on all the strategic decisions involved in running the empire he was destined to inherit. Much of his time these days was spent wrangling their various political interests and lobbying efforts around D.C. into something resembling an organised muster.

There was little drama when they appeared out of thin air in his living room. Ben gave a small start of shock, but he was half-expecting the possibility of a visit from dragon-santa in the next few days. Philip had called to warn him, but he hadn't thought it would come so soon. He adapted admirably.

"Christopher, hello. Good god man, I have a doorbell," Ben put a hand over his heart and adopted his best winning attitude. "A trick like that is a good way to give someone a heart attack. No need for putting holes in my wall either, I don't imagine we're going to argue much. Please, have a seat you three."

"You talked to Philip," Chris nodded in understanding but refused the offered seat. "It ruins much of my jolly charm when you're prepared. I hope the message got through at least."

"I wouldn't exactly say I ran down to the store for milk and cookies, Chris," Benjamin chuckled amiably. "But yes, I got your message loud and clear. I'd actually like to apologize to you on behalf of my family. Some of them get caught up in their wealth and scheming. Then they start taking our privilege for granted and forget that they're human, that their actions have human impact. What Patrick did to you and others was terribly wrong, and it was wrong of us to help shield him from the consequences."

"That's all well and good. And thank you, Ben. Can I call you that?" Chris accepted his nod and ran his eyes around the modest room with interest. It wasn't nearly as ostentatious as he would have expected from a Riker. "It's the first time anyone actually fessed up and said sorry. You'd think that would be the first thing on anyone's lips. Phil could have saved himself the hassle of a new carpet if he'd realised that."

"He can be a stubborn one," the younger Riker nodded. "Blame his background in law if you like, rule number seventeen, never admit liability."

"I'd be more inclined to blame it on his lack of a soul, but that's just my opinion."

"Nice one," Kat encouraged out of the blue as she passed behind him on her own whiskey-inspired inspection of the room. She blessed Chris with a sassy hip bump as she did so. It drew Benjamin's attention like an owl to a mouse.

"Who are your helpers on this busy evening, Chris?"

"Anonymous." Chris put a dash of menace in his voice to discourage any notions of further investigation. "They're here for your protection mostly, in case I start getting carried away."

Benjamin stiffened in his chair. Unlike Philip, he understood the potential fragility of his own life. This young man, this dragon, was a killer. His gut told him that they wouldn't be hearing from cousin Patrick ever again. Though that wasn't too great a loss, and actually released the family from any ongoing obligation to him, it was a wakeup call to his self-preservation.

"Now there's no need for anything like that," he tried with open palms. "I'm a reasonable man. Say what's on your chest and I'll see what I can do to put you at ease."

"That's nice, but you're also a politician, so I'll take a wheelbarrow full of salt along with any promises." Chris found himself pacing across a rug and stopped, turning to look right at the guy. He just wanted to get this over with and go home now. "It boils down to actions, Benjamin. Philip probably told you all about my mad threats. Okay, back at you. How will you and your family act to convince me you know how to play by the rules? Are you members of society, or a bunch of entitled, kidnapping psychopaths? I don't care about how much money you make, I just want you to do right."

"I don't mean offence, but right by who, Chris? To what standard and letter of the law?"

"If you have to ask yourself those questions, you're doing it wrong," Chris growled in frustration. "You put yourselves on my radar, not the other way around. Just because your wealth and power have let you self-govern for decades doesn't mean it was ever right to do so."

"I see." Ben's tone soured despite himself. "So you would appoint yourself our judge and executioner if necessary."

"I don't fucking want to, man! I'd much rather be at home in bed, never knowing you existed. Instead, I find your type running amok, all the D.A.'s are too scared to touch you, the real judges and lawmakers in your pockets. If there's no one else around willing to call you out for your bullshit, I'll step up to the god-damn plate. That's just how I was raised."

"A fair point. You know, I used to feel the same way when I was your age. Would you believe that?" the older man smiled wistfully. "I wonder what went wrong along the way. It was a gradual slide into megalomania, I think."

"Well then pull yourself back out. Who knows, it might be satisfying. Anyway, it's late and I'm tired. I've said my part so we'll head off now."

"Sure thing."

"Open your eyes, Ben. There's a dragon dressed as Santa in your lounge room and we are racing headlong for an existential cliff. People like you could actually do some good in keeping the wheels from falling off this ride if you grew back your conscience. I don't care if you're making money hand over fist in the process, so long as you're pulling your weight. I'll be trying my best to do exactly that. Just... I don't know, hire some better ethics advisors. Something."

"Message received, I'll do what I can. Good evening, Chris. I hope if we meet again it will be in more friendly circumstances."

"So do I, dude," Chris nodded tiredly as Lisa and Kat converged to his sides. "So do I."

After they were gone, Benjamin sat up for several more hours until his eyelids started to rebel. He considered what the dragon had said honestly and fairly, brainstorming potential ideas down in a trusty notebook. There had been some valid points raised. He'd found himself having to look the other way in the family's dealings more and more over the last decade. Also, he was pretty sure no one had called him 'dude' in at least as many years. It actually brought him a little smile.

<em>Chris and Hailey go to visit the President and his advisors to explain the moon incident and help educate about the possibilities of magic. Their message is not well received, and it appears there will be problems, backstabbing, and delays on both sides of the Revelation. Nyx is on the move. The brood deals with the aftermath of the incident with Radek and settles into their new domestic situation. Susan is assaulted on her way to work and robbed. In an emotional, helpless moment, she turns to a dark family secret and enters a bargain with an ancient magical plant. Meanwhile the culprits escape, and Reyla begs Chris not to go on another rampage of vengeance lest the Synod is forced to act against him. The new house is progressing, and so are the dragoness' pregnancies. With legal avenues unavailable, Michelle is forced to use Chris in a wild night of extortion, imprisonment, and intimidation against bad actors in the ongoing fallout of Being kidnappings.</em>

***

Chris was bumped out of a deep slumber with a muffled groan, roused by the restless stirrings of the small, warm figure in his arms. Wonderfully drowsy moments followed as he pulled the naked sprite closer under the covers. Eyes closed, it felt amazing to just lie there, warm and content. Unfortunately, his own tired body soon began to protest. It hadn't moved lately either, and overworked muscles across his shoulders, back, and arms now demanded a proper stretching.

That's what happened after Lillian wanted an evening sparring session to 'work out some stress'. He paid the price in stiffness the next day. Damn, she was worth it though. Other parts of him that weren't currently stiff, and had nothing to do with combat training, were also tender after their vigorous, passionate 'cooldown'.

"Unggh, ouch," Chris grunted as Immi shuffled again, this time thrusting an obstreperous blue wing-joint right into his lips. He was decidedly awake now, turning his abused face into the comfort of a cooler expanse of pillow, smacking his smarting lips experimentally. His movement set off a chain reaction of sleepy protests from both mates. Chris smiled guiltily, tempted to do it again just to hear them grumble so cutely.

From behind, Annabel snaked a hand across his abdomen, burrowing her nose into his shoulder blade. He sighed ruefully, grinning as he blinked his eyes open. Such were the delights and trials of having two lovely companions in bed. It both lived up to his wildest fantasies and robbed him of much-needed sleep.

With an enormous yawn, he carefully extracted his arm from underneath Immi's head to rub at his mouth. His body couldn't be ignored now, moving just felt too good. Flexing into an enormous stretch, he unleashed an inarticulate growl of lazy pleasure. Delicious tension eased from his muscles, triggering a cascade of shivers all the way down to his toes. Of course, this disruption drew even more murmured protests, even a reprisal slap on his naked tummy.

"Oof," he grunted at the unexpected discipline, but she was already rubbing it better.

"You're the worst middle spoon in history," Annabel murmured groggily, butting her head gently against the base of his neck.

"Sorry," Chris rumbled, focusing sleepy eyes through a gap in the dark bedroom curtains. "Immi poked me with a wing again."

By the diffuse light from street lamps below their apartment, he could just make out the flurry of hazy flakes flailing past in the predawn night. The wind howled spookily, tugging at the building in a credible attempt to uproot their cozy little bedroom.

"'S no excuse."

"Is that so?" he challenged, stretching once again. His throaty noises morphed into an elongated moan of satisfaction as nerves all through his body accepted signals of gratitude from re-awakening muscles. His bladder took the opportunity to make its needs felt, not urgently, but headed firmly in that direction. "Well, I'm awake now."

"Chris?" Immi frowned adorably up at him in the dim light, finally woken by all the jostling as he reached over her to drink from his water bottle on the nightstand.

"It's okay, pet," Chris assured as he settled back down between them. "Go back to sleep."

"Your fault," Annabel groaned, reaching across him to vindictively pinch at a perfect blue globe of Immianthe's plush little butt.

"Aieee!" the sprite jolted under the blankets, rolling away from the unprovoked attack into the colder portion of their large bed. "What was that for!"

"Geez, Annabel, you're a cranky customer this morning," Chris intervened, pinning the marauding arm firmly with one of his own. Consolingly, he reached toward the confused sprite with the other. "Sorry Immi, I woke her up after you bumped me and now she's being a grouch. Come here, and I'll give you a head-rub for a bit before I have to get up?"

"Mhhh..." Immi scowled warily, curling into a ball against the chill. She watched for any further attacks sallying over the other side of the dragon-wall as she contemplated the offer before finally agreeing. "Okay, I do love a good head-rub."

"What about mine?" Annabel complained drowsily.

"If you get one, that's subject to good behaviour," Chris warned, releasing her hand on parole to collect Immi's long, loose braid of midnight-blue hair as she scuttled gratefully back into his warmth.

She scooted in close, eye to eye this time as his big hand trailed down her back, finding and releasing the silken scrunchie that kept all her beautiful tresses manageable at night. She was growing fast, but he could still cup her head in a single hand. That always made her seem fragile to him, breakable, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary.

"Mmm ... Mmmaster," Immi shuddered out a quiet breath as he lazily teased out her hair on the pillows, running fingers delightfully across her scalp. Her head nestled perfectly on his warm bicep, his skillful digits followed the river of deep blue down her neck, combing across her back and between her folded wings. His other hand played up and down her side, cupping, caressing. Sometimes, as the fancy took him, he brought it all the way up and forward to ghost across the swell of her breasts. He taunted her awakening nipples maddeningly with feather-light brushes.

"Such a tease, kiss me," the sprite purred.

So they kissed, languid and drowsy. Under the covers they hid, sharing the warmth of lovers as outside, the heart of winter prowled ever-closer on freezing gusts. Behind them, Annabel only managed a few moments of sleepy sulking before she sank back into the lapping waves of slumber.

Predictably, it didn't take much of that sort of nooky to get two such lusty creatures irrepressibly aroused. Kissing Immi these days was a far more practical, enjoyable affair with her growing dimensions. Her loving coos and nimble little hands soon had him rising to the occasion. Once his erection made itself known by bumping into her calves, the lusty nymphet employed a skillful battle strategy, teasing him into a frenzy with delicate caresses of her dainty feet and the smooth heat of her legs.

Chris groaned, his growing need to relieve himself only seemed to amplify his cock's sensitivity to her touch. He found her warm, perfect little slit in retaliation, reaching between her thighs to stroke and tease her dewy labia.

"Immi, stop," he finally hissed, tearing himself away from molesting the sweet-smelling blue skin of her neck with his lips. He didn't, however, remove his finger from the molten little crevice between her legs. The relaxing scalp rub was long forgotten. "I don't want to make a mess in the covers."

"I'll ... I'll clean up," she promised shakily. "No, please, let me have it. Yeah, don't stop ... ooohhhh!" Wings shuddering, she cried out sweetly as his fingers found and danced across her stiff, fiery little nubbin. Her nails scratched across his chest as a healthy wave of pleasure rolled up her spine like a cresting swell, then crashed thunderously down to her curling azure toes. "Master, I swear you're not leaving this bed for a week once I stuff this beautiful cock in me. Give it to me, please? Now!"

"Immi!" He pulled his hips backward as she tried to finish him with a quick rhythm between the softness of her calves. His excited cockhead throbbed, spurting a slippery warning up across blue, silken thighs.

"Fine! Ung ... I hate this! Hurry up and make me grow faster, it's not fair." The little princess pounded her fists against his arm to drive the injustice home. Reluctantly she relinquished her throbbing prize from between her legs. She smiled suddenly, a wicked idea blossoming inside her. "Annabel, wake up! Time to get to work."

"What?" Chris wondered, squeezing his cock below the helmet to release some sensitivity. "It's still early..."

But Immi was already pushing, rolling him over toward Annabel, clambering on top of him as he went.

"Hold her arms up!" the sprite bossed, muffled by the covers. She pounced on the groggy brunette before Annabel knew what was coming.

"Immi!" it was Annabel's turn to protest now as the sprite twined around her, attached like a lusty limpet.

Intrigued, Chris captured his First's hands in his own before she could rally a defence. He was excited by the indignant shrieks, tousled bed-hair, and hinted, wrestling shapes under the covers.

"Let me go, Chris! Don't you dare -" she cut off, struggling mightily as Immi did god-knows-what out of sight beneath the rapidly overheating bedding.

"I think I'll allow it," he chuckled evilly from behind, teasing his teeth over the pale, soft skin of her scrumptiously feminine tricep. "Seems to me like payback is only fair."

"She's pawing at me, Chris! I swear to God I'll - oh," Annabel's hissing cut off as Immi's little toes poked up out of the covers by their chins. The indignant young woman stopped struggling, and a contemplative smile crossed her lips. "Hmm ... mmnn ... I guess that's not so bad."

"What's going on under there?" Chris smirked, freeing one of her hands to lift the blankets. He couldn't really see the details, but his imagination filled in the blanks. Warm, pungent woman hit his sensitive nose. "She has an industrious little tongue, doesn't she?"

"Uh-huh." Annabel's eyelids fluttered, and her body relaxed in his grip. "She knows just how to use it, too."

"Is that a dig?" he frowned slightly, concerned that he might have been neglecting his oral duties. That simply wouldn't do, not a dragon. "You know I like going down -"

"Hush," she moaned, turning her head to kiss him as her free hand worked its way down to the enormous, almost-erect cock that was draping itself across her backside. She squeezed gently at his spongy knob, rhythmically, just the way he liked. It responded predictably. "You do just fine, babe, but your true talent is right here. Sometimes a girl wants a good rug munching, and sometimes she just wants a dick, ya know?"

"All the time," he challenged cockily, sawing his rampant penis between the firm, creamy buns of his fiance's spectacular behind.

"Why choose?" Annabel giggled, opening her legs for him as Immi tugged gently on her pubic hair and gently kissed her exposed, sensitive sex. She huffed under the sprite's assault as a drumbeat of achy need began thumping somewhere deep in her tummy. Her inner muscles were squeezing down in anticipation, her vagina was still unbearably empty.

"Spoken like a dragon," Chris nibbled teasingly at the base of her neck.

Annabel arched her back under the covers, pushing his girthy meat downward to meet her pink, juicy furrow.

"Fuck me already."

Immi did the honours, raising Annabel's upper leg high, holding his daunting hardness in place as he nudged his way inside her. She smiled, hearing her Mistress groan whorishly through the muffling covers as she was spread wide, hips bucking backward for more. Her Master was gentle, slowly feeding more and more of his magnificent cock into her Mistress as Immi played hands and tongue strategically over their tight, pungent coupling. Her Mistress took him so easily. It really wasn't fair, and she punished Annabel with merciless attention to her lust-throbbing clit.

Immi was about to finally stuff her face into the musky heat of his slowly rocking balls when a big hand reached up her leg and insinuated itself boldly between her thighs. The sprite moaned her appreciation against the sawing root of his shaft as a finger probed at her own neglected, wet little box. Her plans for testicular suffocation were momentarily put on hold as she arched and shivered in the moment of thick penetration. Then she shrieked as a second, slimmer digit wormed its way undeniably inside her up against the first. It was much more than she was accustomed to, but she was thrilled that they were both inside her. Her Mistress's thumb found her too, and it was suddenly all too much for Immi as Annabel returned the favour, swirling gently but relentlessly over Immi's wet little love-button.

"Listen to her come," Annabel giggled as the sprite thrashed and squeaked under the comforter. "It's fucking adorable how sexy-tough she plays, but then she comes apart on a hair-trigger."

"She's not the only one on a hair-trigger right now," Chris protested, doing his best not to explode, his dick bathed lavishly in liquid vaginal bliss. Ensconced deep in the snug warmth of Annabel's creamy pussy, he was having a deliciously hard time holding off. They weren't moving all that much, but she was milking him on purpose, slowly clamping and releasing inner muscles with wondrous hidden strength. "I'm going to ... Dee, slow down, stop!"

"That's the whole point!" came her singsong reply as her hand slid possessively onto his butt, encouraging him to churn his way to bliss in her moist, hot folds. Biting her lip at him over her shoulder, Annabel thrust backward even as she pulled him deeper, inching undeniably toward her thirsty womb.

"All the way, babe. Don't you dare stop. Yes, ahhh fuck, you're a fucking machine! Do it, do it, that's it! I want every last drop, Chris."

His whole body shook, cock swelling, hot and heavy as molten iron. There was no way to resist, her nubile cunt was humping him in perfect rhythm, and her words were just the sort of shit he knew he shouldn't love so much, but did anyway. In a guttural exhalation, he swelled, pulsing mightily inside her. Abdomen shuddering, his full bladder added its own brand of pleasurable torture as viscous seed began racing up his cock in wonderful spasms. With a gasp, he felt it belch forth, thick, hot, and full of potent magic.

"Yes! Huunnhhhhh ... Chris, oh, Jesus, yes!" Annabel moaned, shivering in delight as his warmth bloomed within. Her own unstoppable orgasm flowed lazily over her, sweat dewing across her skin under the suddenly-stifling duvet. Her legs kicked, almost cramping. Bartholomew was going crazy on her tummy, but she had only one thought as he throbbed out more and more chunky, sticky ropes against her magically enhanced cervix.

Dragon and mate thought alike, pressing firmly together, all primal grunts and grasping hands. Their spooned position wasn't the best, but they made it happen. He took her hips harshly, she spurred her nails into his behind and shoved backward, flattening her own buttocks against his hips. The sprite was dislodged, momentarily forgotten as his spewing cock slipped effortlessly, wonderfully, deeper. Magically made possible, the dragon claimed the scalding crucible of her fertile womb.

Annabel screamed wordlessly, seeing stars as he filled and flooded her like one of his dragonesses. She could feel every throb of that fat, peach-like helmet, so deep and hot inside her. He took her, affirming their bond in the most primitive, undeniable, and extraordinarily enjoyable way.

Chris growled in turn, hips churning into her like a wild dog on a farmer's prize bitch. His cock seethed with every gout of successfully delivered seed, orgasmic impulses racing up and down his length.

He couldn't help himself, suddenly rolling on top of her, crushing her slim body into the bed as he grabbed her shoulders and just started lunging at her upturned bottom with everything he had. Blood rushed in his ears, drowning out Annabel's obscene demand that he fill her good little pussy right-the-fuck-up. His eyes squeezed tight as ecstasy and release throbbed through every cell, he really didn't need the encouragement. It was all he could do not to breed her then and there, to the musical, unintelligible notes of her pleasure mingling with the bass grunts of his own.

Reproductive instinct gradually faded with his orgasm, but his abused bladder began screaming all the louder. He was still panting, clinging desperately to Annabel as he felt Immi impatiently nudging his legs apart. The hungry little fiend tried to worm her tongue under his balls, eager to claim the sticky, magic-rich treat that was already leaking from their pulsing coupling. He smiled, after setting him up like this, how could he begrudge her ravenous ways. Besides, lovely as it might be to stay ensconced inside Annabel as they recovered together, nature really was calling now.

With a kiss and a whisper of thanks against her rosy neck, Chris carefully extracted his throbbing, cream-streaked cock and left his two ladies to their sapphic debauchery. He rushed for the bathroom, barely making it before his bladder gave way. The release found there wasn't quite as profound, but it was profoundly appreciated nonetheless.

When he'd cleaned himself up, and the tiles surrounding the toilet, he prepared a fresh, warm washcloth and returned to bed. Annabel welcomed him back, taking the cloth appreciatively but holding off on its use. She was on her back, and under the covers, Immi was hard at work, the shape of her ass wiggling back and forth happily as she took her fill.

"I hope there's some left for Bartholomew," Chris joked as he tucked a sweat-damp lock behind Annabel's ear, nibbling teasingly on her pale lobe. "Immi seemed especially frisky."

"I'd be more worried about Susan if I were you," Annabel shifted on her back, adjusting her legs slightly wider to let the sprite work. "It's been what, a week and a half now?"

He didn't reply, stiffening as he sensed trouble.

"You're avoiding her, Chris. I think I'd go crazy if you refused to, well ... hump me, for that long. I barely managed a few days when you put that enchantment on me."

"It's complicated."

"That's BS. I'm here for you, babe, it's me. Uncomplicate it, and together we figure out how to move on."

He sighed, trying to rally his thoughts on an issue he'd been dodging. He would rather not talk about it because he wasn't entirely comfortable, nor sure of his own reasoning.

"It's hard to ... Susan's different now, Annabel. Magically, emotionally I think. My dragon is uneasy around her, plus there's the fact that my enchantments are gone completely. I don't even know if we could, you know ... have sex properly. How exactly am I meant to bring that up non-awkwardly."

"Gone, Master?" Immi wriggled up Annabel's front to join the conversation, her long hair now messy and adorably bedraggled. Annabel captured her chin and wiped it clean with the washcloth before she let Immi collapse on her.

"Yeah," Chris reached over, tracing his hand up and down the curve of the sprite's back as she settled her head contentedly in the crook of Annabell's neck. "Whatever that thing is, it gobbles up magic like nobody's business. You've got some competition there, little one."
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"I will face any challenge," Immi purred, a sleepy smile on her little lips. "In a few hours."

"Talk to her, Chris," Annabel implored, locking eyes to drive home her request. "She's too ashamed to say anything, but I know she's pining for you. It must be eating her up inside, the intimacy you two had is a hard thing to lose all of a sudden."

"I will," he promised. "I will, it's just that I've been so busy."

"About humping specifically, Chris. You've been ploughing Claire like a farmer's best potato field, so you're not that busy. No wheedling out, it's very unbecoming for a dragon."

"I ... shit. I've been supportive, haven't I? I didn't want to rush into things after such a ... Well, you know what I mean, right? That plant is mega-creepy."

"Yes, Babe, it is. And everyone agrees you've been great in every way but one."

"The one that counts," Immi sniggered.

"Quiet you," Annabel had to suppress a smile at her lover's antics, this was serious brood-business. "Chris, we're all here to help any way we can, but you can't avoid this. You need to show her she's still loved, still part of your brood, evil-wooden-tentacle-thingys and all."

"I know, Dee. I just ... okay, today. I'll talk to her today, that's a promise."

"Thank you." She leaned into him, kissing his lips softly. It was a gesture full of heartfelt affection. That kiss of hers had something about it that made him feel like he was a hot stack of pancakes, and she the delicious butter melting all over him. It was wholesome, it was great. "Now, I'll give you five more minutes of cuddle time, then you'd better get going. No point in wasting your valuable time if you're already up."

"Only five minutes?" he complained. "It's so early. I suppose you'll be getting up too? More magic practice?"

"Hmm, too cold. Besides, we need our beauty sleep." Annabel shook her head, smiling teasingly at him across the pillow. Her beautiful brown eyes looked so playful in the dim bedroom that Chris was tempted to try his luck and crawl on top of her again.

"Yeah," Immi agreed, patting her tummy under the covers. "I'm a growing sprite, and I need my rest. Go build us a house or something."

"Ppbbpbpbbb," Chris exhaled through his lips like an exasperated equine. "What do you think I've been doing all Autumn? You'd think a hard-working dragon would get some appreciation here and there."

"You can't complain if you insist on keeping it some big mystery," Annabel rebutted.

"Fine, fine!" he admitted good-naturedly, giving them each one last peck before swinging his legs out of bed and sitting up. "Be ready, though, the big reveal is only days away."

"I wonder," his First purred leadingly, rolling lazily to watch as he headed for the bathroom again.

"What's that?" he asked.

"I was thinking that the brood will have to put our heads together and come up with a suitable celebration, a private housewarming?"

He paused, looking wistfully back at the two bed-haired beauties grinning enticingly at him. Annabel wriggled her eyebrows jauntily, mischief, love, and sex peeking up at him under the covers from lovely brown eyes. Right then he wanted nothing more than to snuggle back in beside them and let his responsibilities fade away for a day or two. Unfortunately, it just couldn't be.

In the steamy embrace of an invigorating shower, his imagination churned. What intriguing rewards might Annabel and the girls come up with? Would they love the new house as much as he hoped? These and other thoughts delayed him, so that much of the household was up and about by the time he emerged.

It seemed everyone was rising earlier these days. Chris suspected that it was a show of solidarity, at least on behalf of Claire, Petra, and Hailey, whose schedules weren't nearly as full or regimented as his own. They certainly didn't need to be up at this early hour, but when he emerged, clothed and ready for the day, there they were, waiting to pounce.

Chris held his breath as a pyjama-clad, grabby dragoness snared him on the couch and tried to turn simple good-morning-kisses into much more. Petra wasn't above using small wafts of her pheromones to overcome his resistance, but for now, he had firm control on his desires. There was the unspoken taste of competition hanging in the air. Sure enough, Claire tried her own tricks to keep him on the sofa with her too.

Hailey, he used as a brief respite, a safe shelter before he dove headlong into the midst of hurricane Michelle-Lillian. The studious young woman was up early, a mug of fragrant chocolate clutched in both hands as she re-read the figures and equations she'd been working on the previous evening. Chris thought she looked simply adorable sitting there in a pink towelling robe, a stern frown of concentration on her brow. Dogeared papers, scribbled flow diagrams, and a sketch or two clearly declared a section of the large dining room table hers. She held reign there in no uncertain terms whenever she stayed over. Chris couldn't wait to at least get her her own room, it was the very least she deserved.

"How's it going?" He whispered near her ear, draping himself over her chair from behind.

Smiling, Hailey eagerly guided his arms around her, leaning up for a soft kiss as they hugged.

"I think I've cracked it," she enthused quietly. "At least it's good enough to send away for review. Isabella said she knows some folks she can consult without giving away, you know, our magical goose."

"Miss Sibon," he protested jokingly, nuzzling aside the robe to get at the tender flesh above her irresistible collar bone. "I'll have you know that as a dragon, I resent the unfavourable comparison to a honking barnyard bully."

She began giggling and squirming at the ticklishness of his whisper-soft kisses and warm puffs of air.

"Chris, eeek ... stop! Stop," Hailey gasped breathlessly, chest just starting to heave. Her next words were quiet, almost conspiratorial. "I'm full, you'll make me let down."

"Mhhhh," he growled low. "You smell delicious. Let me greet the others, and then we'll go take care of that. Can you hold on?"

"Uh-huh. But Chris, before you go off making plans for the day, can we please go over some of the math for my equations tonight? If you're going to be manipulating the orbs like this, I think you'll have to understand the underlying calculations and parameters on a very detailed level."

"Sure, Mini Moo, how about after dinner? You'll have to be patient with me though, math was never my strong suit."

"It's okay." Hailey leaned her head back against his shoulder, hands reaching up to trail through his shower-damp hair. "I managed to teach you a little particle physics, so there's hope yet. But remember, we need gold, it's going to take a lot."

"Already on it. Okay, I'm going in, how are the waters this morning?" Chris glanced up to the other end of the table where Michelle sat, diligently typing away on her laptop. His eyes tracked over to Lillian, who sat at the kitchen bar, glancing daggers at Michelle with all her voluptuous glory. When she caught him looking, the vampiress quickly went back to scrolling through something on her phone, guilty as could be.

"Warmer today, I think," whispered Hailey as she glanced from one woman to the other. "The icebergs are melting."

"Well, shit. Wish me luck."

Chris felt Lillian watching him with those dark, hungry eyes as he left Hailey and headed toward the kitchen. His path to the coffee-making supplies took him between the vampire and his human Familiar, and he rightly sensed that it would be a mistake to greet either of them and thus invite a perceived favour.

In a possibly foolhardy show of neutrality, he breezed past the both of them, collected the parts of the espresso maker from a cupboard, and began assembling the little stovetop device. He forced himself to ignore his dragon's instincts, the warning tingle on his neck as he exposed his back to a moody bloodsucker.

If she did pounce on him, it would probably be to devour him with kisses and 'love bites'. Probably. There would still be an excruciating half-second of limbo, as she lunged through the air, where he wouldn't be able to tell.

Lillian was deep in the midst of a vamp-sulk that had already lasted two days. In an unfortunate turn of events, she'd been kept from claiming him on the evening she'd somewhat jokingly purchased from Michelle at great expense. Though the money apparently did change hands.

He was still struggling with Lillian's wealth. Tithe wasn't in his vocabulary six months ago, let alone a few weeks.

But it was Lillian's mounting shifts with Reyla that set them down this path, in Chris' opinion anyway. For amongst the recent inflow of migrants to Reyla's territory, a pair of unruly werecat brothers were attempting to set up an ambitious little protection racket. The more vulnerable Being merchants and crafts folk had initially yielded to the sly new bullies, which only served to make them bolder. Other, more recently immigrated Beings were easy targets too, unsure of the local customs and low on social connections to fall back on. But when Lillian came calling to adjust their attitudes on Reyla's behalf, they'd foolishly tried their luck at giving her a thumping. When cornered and without options, perhaps they saw it as an opportunity to raise their standing in the underground hierarchy.

Lillian was forced to employ the controlled wrath of a five-hundred-year-old vampiress. Though their teamwork and lightning-fast reflexes had been an invigorating test of her abilities, she'd left two huge leopards yowling and bruised in the basement of some construction site. She was impressed by the fight they'd put up. They were to inquire with Reyla's second, Timothy, for jobs, or get the hell out of town. After all, rival protection crews didn't tolerate trespass or competition well.

If the two felines could crack heads so ambitiously to line their pockets, perhaps they could be convinced to do so more legitimately for Reyla.

So, when Lillian returned home after midnight to find Michelle capitalising on her absence, she'd flipped out a little. Okay, she'd lost it.

Perhaps Chris could have used better judgement. But it turned out that Michelle could be remarkably persuasive in a sexy, hard to argue-with way. She almost came at him like a prosecutor, eroding away his defence from every angle with logic and evidence. They'd been mating furiously against a doorframe in Michelle's bedroom when they were caught red-handed.

Of course, in seducing him in Lillian's continued absence at eleven pm that fateful evening, Michelle hadn't done anything that Lillian wouldn't have done in a heartbeat, were they to exchange shoes. Lillian even admitted so afterwards, promising that she wasn't truly upset. However, her aggressive vampirism over the last few days told a slightly different story.

At least Lillian's newly encouraged vampiric side had targeted him to vent the worst of her feelings and not Michelle, at least not physically. If it weren't for being a dragon, he would be sporting more than a few stiff muscle groups after their savage love making last night. That wasn't even counting the sparring which came beforehand. This new Lillian was frightfully strong. He could handle that, barely, but he worried that the incident was derailing his progress with her vampiric side.

So now he weathered the storm of Lillian's possessive brand of ire.

By rote, he reached for a new foil packet of coffee grounds, ripping the top clean off. Rich, earthy coffee hit his senses like a moist, oncoming sea breeze. He inhaled deeply, thoughts of Lillian banished by olfactory overload. With his acute, draconic sense of smell, a fresh pack of coffee was a whole-body experience to be enjoyed.

It was almost a physical thing, as though someone had poured an entire hessian sack full of fresh-roasted beans into a wood-chipper and aimed the chute at his face. He could taste hints of a hundred flavours, from delicate hidden chocolate all the way through the pallet to deep, satisfying bitterness. It was hard to resist. He brought it to his nose and drew in another breath, enjoying the sensory immersion.

Lillian chose her moment correctly.

"Aaeeekk!" Chris yelped rather unmanfully as she slid her arms silently around his torso. From behind, her every curve moulded warm against his back. She hugged him with arms seemingly made of steel cable. He tried to salvage his dignity by trailing off in a deep, throaty rumble, but who was he kidding really? She'd struck, and from their time sparring, he knew he was at her mercy in this position. Telekinesis would hold her feet to the floor, and there would be no throwing her at all.

"You let your guard down, young one," she tsked softly, putting her chin on his shoulder, embracing him almost exactly as he'd done with Hailey moments ago. None of his brood but her could match his height like that, his beautifully dangerous warrior woman.

"I guess that means I must trust you," he chuckled, pressing back into her tall, lush figure. Now was no time to be nervous, and moving away would be a mistake. By the way she held her hands carefully but firmly on his tummy, he suspected that her sharp, dark claws were out. That also meant that her fangs were probably poised near his skin, her eyes unnerving pools of darkness. He was definitely dealing with the vampiress.

"Foolish," she chided without sting, pressing herself closer still, smooshing sweater-covered breasts against him, warm and resistant.

"Well I'm not about to apologise for that, Lillian," Chris turned his head, kissing her chin briefly, trying for nonchalance as he got back to preparing Susan's morning brew. "Besides, I have you to be eternally vigilant for me. And seeing as our existence together could be neigh-eternal, I figure I'll pass off that responsibility early on in the piece, perhaps to someone with more experience? I mean, if I can't relax at home with you, what's the point in any of this?"

"You should be ready to defend yourself at any moment. I'm training your body, but your mindset still holds you back," the vampire paused, thinking over his words. "I should not care for such things, but thank you. It is a touching sentiment even if -"

"Lillian," he spoke firmly, interrupting her. He turned slowly, forcefully inside her arms. She let him, pulling back only slightly, watching warily until they were nose to nose. Those pitch-black eyes stared right back at him, seemingly soulless, though he knew that couldn't be further from the truth. "No buts. I love you, crazy vampire baggage and all. I'm glad that you and this dark-eyed ancient parasite of yours are coming to terms, even if you are a homicidal, possessive pain in my ass sometimes. We are going to spend happy centuries together if I get my way. Please don't feel insecure about what happened with Michelle the other night."

"Chris, I ... we are...," she faltered, eyes swirling to a mottled brown for a moment before the black closed in again, darker than ever. "I ... I am possessive, untrusting, a wicked creature. I don't know if that will ever change."

"And that's okay," he assured, taking one of her hands from his side and gently pulling it to his lips. Carefully, he kissed the backs of each deadly, obsidian talon that had grown from her nail beds. "I just want to make sure you're okay. I'll be your rough-sex, punching-bag, blood-box dragon forever and ever if that's what it takes because you're a friend."

They were silent for a long, stretching moment filled with questing black eyes. Finally, the beast sighed, relaxing as she laid her head on his shoulder.

"Can I feel it again? Please?"

"Of course," he smiled softly.

By dragon instinct, Chris reached outward with his power, closing his eyes to visualise the traces of himself, of his magic that swirled nearby. His itch was still lurking in her, diluted into almost every cell, mingling with the parasitic things that animated them like skilled puppet masters.

He inhaled slowly, deeply, and as he let the breath go, Chris poured out all the warmth, love, desire, and acceptance he felt for all of his mates. Concentrating, he poured these emotions and more outward to Lillian, to all his growing children and their beautiful mothers, connected by his dragon's magic.

Channelling the effect like that was quite draining, but worth it to feel her quiver and relax, to hear the quiet hitch of stalled breath. He managed a good few seconds, but as always, his focus began to degrade by the moment. His hold on it slipped through his loosening mental grasp like an oiled eel, single-minded focus replaced ever more rapidly by incongruous fancy, then frustration at his own failure. Chris cut the effect before he passed his weak-willed disappointment down their link. He opened his eyes.

"I want you," the vampiress husked deep, her accent thick and adorable. Her forehead bumped into his, their noses brushing. "Now."

"Lillian," he protested wryly. "We can't. You know I -"

"I know, I know." She flicked her head tempestuously, filling the air with the warm, honeyed scent of her hair as she reluctantly let him out of their embrace. "Go, before I rip these stupid clothes off and gobble you all up."

"Well, actually I was the one in the kitchen so...."

"Go," she purred dangerously. Her eyes darkened again, and she placed warding hands against his chest.

It was time to retreat. Chris hastily filled the coffee pot with water, screwed it together and put it on the stove at medium heat. The vampiress didn't move, playing out some internal struggle between human and base instinct as he bustled to get out of her way.

Logically, Lillian knew that she couldn't have him whenever the desire struck her. They both had busy schedules, vital work to do to keep both this strange, growing family and the magical world outside on-track. She needed to share him, not monopolise his time and affection. These notions, however, were foreign to the awakened entity lurking within. Facing a multitude of challenging and human impressions on a daily basis was hard for it. So was trusting, after being wrestled into subservience and magical incarceration for so long. That previously beaten-down creature hadn't had to care for social niceties before, nor decencies and morals. They were both learning, both growing, human and vampire together ... and the tiny bundle of precious life deep inside her.

"Chris," she spoke softly as he turned to leave. "Thanks."

"Any time, gorgeous," he winked back.

It was unfair, she thought, far more knowing than a boy of nineteen had any right to be.

With twenty minutes or so until the coffee would be ready, and banned from the near vicinity of Lillian on pain of ravishment, Chris went to pay his dues to Michelle. Only, she was in no mood to be pestered, however lovingly. She was muttering under her breath, shaking her head as she blitzed out a politely scathing email. Apparently, the upcoming UN summit was being stalled again by some faction of the government.

So, Claire and Petra lured him back to their sofa, and he was soon happily ensconced between two loving dragonesses, watching a documentary of some sort about Madagascar on TV. Petra was radiating lust, cooing in his ear exactly how it felt when he'd launched his loving feelings out through his itch. Apparently he'd overdone that a little. His mating-venom inside the two dragonesses had picked up his signal overflow readily enough.

Eventually, the mature dragoness wore away his resistance, and he was pulled down into her embrace. The lemurs and chameleons on-screen were a poor distraction as she confidently pulled his hand into her pyjama pants, all the while kissing and nibbling at his throat, chin, and ear. They probably would have spilled onto the floor in a sweaty tangle of sex if he hadn't heard the coffee boiling.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
Lillian was already gone for the day when Chris reluctantly extracted himself to attend to it. Therefore he was free to pour the robust, hot brew into two mugs and doctor it up without fear of vampiric molestation.

She had been busy for a week of mornings, away attending strategy and logistics meetings. Word was out, there was a demon on the loose. The rumour seemed to drive the Being populace for shelter in a way the threat of the Revelation never had. Or perhaps, Chris considered, it was a case of camels and straw. The Synod's limp response hadn't helped.

The Being community was finally awakening to their tremulous situation, contracting, turning inward for support.

On every continent save the coldest, where only a lonely vampire ruled, Beings flooded back to the safety of their territorial overlords and officials. It was quite the turn-around from the disgruntled and surly complaints about the Revelation of weeks before.

Coffee in hand, Chris slipped quietly into Susan's dark bedroom.

She was asleep, but by the dim light seeping around the curtains, it was clear that she'd had a restless night. The bedding was tangled around her legs, a pillow on the floor, and her hair a complete disaster. None of these signs were the most obvious, nor the most ominous. Dark tendrils branched across the sheets around her, twitching as if alert to his intrusion.

The things emerged from the sleeves of her flannel nightwear, jutting out at her wrists, throat, and waist. It was an instinctively unsettling sight, those gnarled, twisting roots emerging seamlessly from creamy skin. Chris couldn't help the shudder that rose up in him as something in his magical senses was lightly revolted in its proximity. Looking at the sueth-azoah was like staring into pieces of yawning darkness to his magic, and more unnerving by the second. They seemed to sink hooks into his eyes, enticing him down toward a bed of soft loam despite his impulse to flee.

This was the woman who had loved and cared for him for years, but he couldn't bring himself to see past the thing that now cohabited her body. Dragon instinct wouldn't allow it. In fact, his reaction was very similar to the instinctive unease of watching a spider scurry nearby, only on an intangible magical level. He wasn't alone in that feeling either. Others raised their energistic hackles around her too, Lillian, his dragonesses, even Reyla. Immi seemed pretty unphased, but sprites were old, with racial memories or tales reaching back to times when sueth-azoah weren't long-forgotten oddities.

Chris' heart jumped painfully in his chest to see the set of her sleeping lips, the pained frown locked on her brow. It wasn't a peaceful expression at all, she looked scared.

"Susan," he spoke softly, placing the steaming mugs down on the bedside table. "Susan."

He stepped closer, careful to avoid one of the tendrils that had spilled onto the carpeted floor during the night. She murmured something inaudible, so he reached for her shoulder. His hand never made it, mere inches before contact, it was intercepted by a coiling, springlike shoot.

The thing wrapped cooly around his wrist in a moment, imparting a sense of delicate, yet somehow undeniable strength. Dragon instinct kicked in. For an adrenaline-infused second, he felt himself drawing breath and magic, preparing to lash out.

Susan's eyes flew open as the touch registered. With a gasp, the tendril was suddenly falling away.

Chris was left struggling to hold still, ghosting sensations of the cool, alien touch of the sueth-azoah replaying up and down his nerves. His hand was clenching slowly open and closed, almost as if recovering from a mild case of pins and needles.

"I'm sorry, I ... oh, Chris!" Susan burst into tears as she saw his expression of shocked revulsion, the beginnings of a snarl on his lips. She yanked back all the unintended extensions of herself, feeling them slither quickly across the bedding and back into her as if they'd never existed.

The slow awareness at the back of her mind seemed puzzled by the stab of anger she shot at it. It had only been searching out their surroundings for places to put down roots after all. It had even found a vibrant, living source of energy from which to sup. What was so repulsive about that?

It must have been trying to drink from his warmth and magic. Susan could see it written on his face, though he tried to hide it a moment later. She couldn't face him after seeing it. Couldn't face the sympathy, the pity, and sorrow she saw kindling in his eyes. They used to be so wonderfully full of genuine love, even lust. Now, this?

She rolled away from him, curling into a ball, trying to swallow down wretched sobs that wanted to rip their way up out of her. It was going to be a bad day.

"Just please, Chris, just leave me be."

Everyone looked at her like that now, even old Eddard.

He didn't, of course. Susan found herself both relieved, and a little annoyed as she felt his weight shift the bed behind her. Soon his arm wrapped around her, pulling himself against her.

"I love you, Susan," Chris breathed against the back of her head. "I don't understand why you chose to implant that thing, but I love you. We will be okay."

They didn't say anything else, just held each other in tentative closeness as the room filled with the scent of their forgotten coffee. Beyond the bedroom door, the sounds of the household grew louder as Annabel and Immi set about breakfast.

"It is regretful, but after this attack, I must take measures to ensure both my sovereignty and my subject's safety," Reyla spoke to the camera rig, projecting her little performance thousands of miles around the world.

More than a hundred stared back, leaders all, the most influential of the magical underworld. These were Lords and Ladies their own territories, clan chiefs, or top representatives of prominent organisations. The preeminent of the magical world were gathered for their monthly congress. Now for a moment, nearing the end of an already lengthy session sharing important inter-territorial business, the stage was hers.

The dark elf held her lips pursed tight, lest they betray her with a treacherous smirk.

"Syndicate members burglarise my citizens in broad daylight under the pretence of trade negotiations? My hand is forced, I hereby bar the free export of magical crystal or such ready currency from my territory. All future interdomain trade of this kind will come directly to my desk."

Reyla could see the representative of House Lefayd agitating in his seat already as she throttled any ambition of trading through their network of intermediaries. The replacement for the disgraced Lord Eramir was a bit of a hothead, a comically unforgivable trait for any leader of their kind. Their former Lord was currently imprisoned somewhere deep under the Atlantic. She baited a pause, and to her delighted astonishment the fool actually bit.

"Speak plainly, by all means, Lady Narlakis. You seek to hoard and tax your newfound wealth of crystal. Riches purchased, I might add, by your willingness to protect an unhinged and dangerous beast."

Hidden under her skirts, Reyla frigged herself a little harder as the fool said almost exactly what she'd known he would. Taut muscles in her thighs and rump balanced on a delicious knife-edge of pleasure as she fantasised on the wickedness of having the young dragon in question devour her needy foo-foo at a time like this.

"Oh please, tell us again of your noble house's innocence," Reyla spat back, portraying a picture of disdain to the camera. Practised venom dripped off every syllable she spoke. She could still play her part even with the great-big, thrumming dragon-crystal pressing against her sex. "My ears have yet to drop off, but not for lack of effort by your questionably qualified tongue. Tell us, would you please? No doubt your predecessor had only the most selfless interests at heart when he tried to have the dragon's pregnant mate murdered under my own roof, correct?"

"He all but destroyed our ancestral keep!" The elf hissed back, goaded and unmindful of their digital audience. "Thousands of years of heritage gon -"

"Order!" John Guthrie barked from his cozy office, halfway across the globe in Scotland. "There is serious business yet to address. Time is precious, I will not allow this meeting to devolve any further toward bickering. House Lefayd has already waived their right for Synod arbitration on the matter in question, quite wisely I might add, so let us move on. Reyla?"

Reyla struggled to withhold laughter as the old dragon slowly chewed the Lefayd upstart, politically speaking, and spat him back out like a troublesome, gristly morsel.

She might be overindulging a little, almost giddy with the thrill of politicking from a newfound position of economic might. What was happening between her thighs was delicious and scandalous, adding to the thrill. Chris' gift felt hot stuffed against her nethers as she slowly rocked her slender hips around and around on top of it. The large, egg-sized diamond was just absurd, formed so impossibly from a fallen conifer. Reyla almost lost her composure as she remembered his huge hand, so passionately gripping her throat.

However, the force that had her so intoxicated that she diddled herself in front of her peers, the real exceptional power, was his magic. It did unspeakable things to her and her elfin libido. To feel his basic essence throb close against her sex, pressing, opening her, but never entirely slipping inside...

Reyla shuddered visibly, snapping her awareness back to the screens before some of the noises that wanted to escape her bubbled up past her lips. She'd nearly missed Lord Guthrie's cue for her to continue. This was simply wicked.

"Ahem, yes. I did express my concerns to you all some months ago about the need for this dragon to be left in peace to start a family. The temptation has clearly proven too much for some of you to resist. Almost daily, I receive reports of the attempted coercion of my citizens by foreign parties. In short, if you want any part of what little crystal is available, you'd best come through official channels. My patience for thievery and espionage has officially expired."

"That is well, Lady Reyla," spoke a powerful leader from the coast of Eastern Africa. "But I am yet to hear a satisfactory explanation for the purported abilities of this young dragon of yours. Surely you do not begrudge our curiosity? The rumours regarding the young man are, how do I put this, sensational? There are precedents for the management of individuals of such extraordinary power, precedents designed to prevent the establishment of tyrants, warmongers, and dangerous monopolies. Your warning has only served to pique my interest and concern, as I'm sure many of our esteemed colleagues will agree."

"I would respect the young dragon's wishes to be left alone if I were you. The last thing I want on my conscience is a repetition of the events my dear cousin was just snivelling about," Reyla cautioned sweetly. However, her tone and silken smile left ample opportunity for the implicit threat.

She couldn't fault the man's logic, he was perilously close to the truth of the matter. Chris was extraordinary, wonderfully so, if the gemstone thrumming against her slippery, midnight-dark labia had any say in the matter. His link to the Old Gods couldn't be uncovered, not before he was firmly and undeniably hers.

They would undoubtedly try to take him from her then. Disconcerting as that thought was, she smiled. Let them try, she doubted very much the dragon would put up with such political interference in his life ever again. It would be fun to watch him dismantle a few other self-important busybodies. House Lefayd had not fared well at all. That was an overindulgent fantasy though, she really was trying to steer them down a more temperate, long-term path after all.

"Peace, Lords and Ladies, peace," the old Scott rumbled, getting his say before anyone else decided to add their opinion and things devolved any further. "I would point out that enacting such measures has almost always ended poorly for the Being in question, and regret amongst the disputing parties. For the sake of my species, I urge us all not to repeat the mistakes of the past, especially in light of the larger challenges we face with the Revelation."

"I agree with Lord Guthrie," Queen Magdalen finally spoke, soft and high-pitched with her saccharine tone. For such a tiny creature, the powerful fairy had inherited the most significant part of Lord Eramir's support block amongst the Synod. She effectively held the reins of this runaway chariot now, though her grip was not nearly as secure as the disgraced elf house had once enjoyed. "There will be time to squabble over our prize subjects if we are still around next year. In the meantime, I have no doubt those who support Lady Reyla will be afforded a taste of her newfound prosperity."

"Yes, of course, Queen Magdalen, thank you," Reyla allowed herself a simpering chuckle at that, transmitted to her fellows around the globe. She would have to find an appropriate bribe to send the crafty fairy, nothing too impressive though.

"Excellent," continued the fairy. "If that is the end of the territorial business, let us move quickly on to other concerns. The humans are still dithering about proposals regarding our judicial authorities, and defensive powers. They're saying it's just a matter of finding an acceptable vocabulary, but it boils down to this. They want us to police ourselves, and help them police their own, whilst retaining almost all judicial and executive authority for themselves within the existing institutions of their lands, even expanding their reach into the magical. Let me assure you we will not agree to such terms. This is probably a negotiation tactic designed to..."

"What about the demon!" interrupted a young leader from South America. "Will no one else speak? My city is bursting at the seams with Beings scared in from the wild. More and more come out of the woodwork every day, Beings we have never seen before, or thought long dead. They stir trouble and demand action, and I have to say that I agree with their sentiment. What good are we if all we do is sit around and talk? I urge you all to take action. You have told us that this demon is largely responsible for the mess with the humans? I say the memory charm is still on the table! Every one of us, every human that falls prey to ... have none of you read the histories? There are billions of them now, all fuel for that twisted sorcery."

Magdalen, queen of all fairy-kind glared silently, watching their transmitted faces. She ignored the uncomfortable looks, the sideways glances off-screen to peers or underlings. The youngster spoke out of turn, but she waited until he ran out of wind, then a little more for dramatic poise.

"It is already done," she finally spoke. "Do you not see that? Truly it was too late from the beginning for such action. I thought much like you when I first heard of Radek, that is on record. Now heed this, I was wrong. Whatever the demon does now, the humans must be with us. Without them on our side, we will tear each other apart just as surely. The monster has tied our fates most cunningly. It is more pressing to secure peace first, to gird ourselves for whatever may come. Then we can devote all our resources to dealing with the loathsome creature."

"A comforting sentiment, when the fiend isn't lurking unchecked in your own backyard."

Reyla's thoughts, now occupied rather more entertainingly in keeping expressions of pleasure off her face, were roused to full attention by the reedy, unfamiliar voice. It was the old Peruvian blood-mage, lending support to the young dissenter. He rarely spoke at all during such meetings, this was a noteworthy development.

"Striking hastily will doom us just the same," Magdalen snapped back, her composure fracturing slightly out of frustration. "Don't you see that? The Synod has voted, must we make more examples? You are all duty-bound, by your oaths, by your lives-forfeit! Dissent, among us at a time like this? We do the demon's work for it."

"We aren't asking you to sit idly," Lord Guthrie came to her aid, ever the soother of such situations. "In fact we encourage you to marshall your forces, prepare defences for your people and infrastructure. The demon has been amongst us a long while now, with any luck a little longer won't prove our undoing. However, another incident like what happened in Argentina will almost certainly do the trick."

"I understand your concern, I do," Magdalen took up the baton, her composure restored. She looked directly at the camera, speaking to each one of them, not their faces on her own screen. "It eluded Stemari, one of our most skilled hunters, if nothing else, proving the severity of the situation. That is why we must make the next strike count, committing every resource and magic we have. It will be impossible to do so with our hands tied, magically speaking, so the Revelation must come first. Now, let us please move on. Lord Harcot?"

"Yes, your eminence?" The vampire lord's smile contained perhaps a little too much honest humour at the entire incident. It earned him a furrow of her tiny, regal brow and an annoyed twitch of a shimmering dragonfly wing.

"Your report on the situation in Indonesia? Perhaps that will keep the hounds off my heels for a few moments."

The youngster looked a bit abashed, but the old blood-mage just nodded solemnly. He understood. This was bigger than he or his people, the Synod would not jeopardise the safety of Beings as a whole for the peace of mind of a few underpopulated territories.

Reyla's attention was drifting again. These meetings could get so dreadfully tedious sometimes, and there was plenty else to occupy her thoughts these days.

"Well ... yes, of course," Lord Harcot broke the pause. "To get to the thick of the matter, I tasked a few useful chaps, humans mind, to get to the islands and infiltrate at the edges of the magical community. Yesterday, I got a message that at least two of them made it out. They think they know what we're dealing with."

"My wayward children again?" Vlad, asked mockingly, expecting another round of blame and accusation. There had been more and more pointed his way as vampire youngsters around the globe continued to cause friction under the new restrictions.

"Not this time, my good man. It's gargoyles."

"Gargoyles?" The ancient vampire started up in his velvet-lined reclining chair. "That doesn't make any sense."

"I thought so too," Harcot nodded. "But from what my man managed to tease out of the locals, they just waltzed out the high jungle in their thousands. Also, there's some connection to an ancient cannibalism cult, so that's just peachy."

"I thought we got rid of that abhorrence."

"I'm not aware of any gargoyles amongst us," Queen Magdalen tsked thoughtfully. "They don't tend to seek positions of responsibility after the conflicts. Do any of you have someone we might consult on this development?"

Reyla let the meeting drone out, the diamond had worked its way perilously, deliciously close to...

"Ahhaaa," the elf burbled quietly, clawing at the armrests of her ornate throne. It had finally slipped inside, warm and hard and thick. Her vagina tensed, squeezing harshly at the smooth intruder, unsure if it wanted him in or out.

"Lady Narlakis?"

Shit.

"I ... ah, I will ask one of my subjects, but I am not hopeful."

"Most unhelpful," Queen Magdalen sounded annoyed at the frivolous interruption, and the elf had been wielding her political rapier so skillfully until now.

In. Reyla decided she definitely wanted it inside her. Tingles of lust ran up her back and to the tips of her breasts and across her scalp . Little beads of sweat broke out instantly on her upper lip, her neck, even her forehead. His magic was inside, and it felt like she was unravelling at the seams. What a delightfully torturous sensation, she mused, flexing her inner muscles experimentally. The rest of her tedious bureaucratic morning was looking up as the flow of the council meeting moved thankfully on around her blunder.

***

A bitter chill had taken residence in the dark depths of his new house. Chris' breath steamed powerfully in the harsh light of his LED work lamp. His exposed fingertips were just starting to feel puffy, but the cold had never bothered him overmuch. Even back on the alpine flat-land Jethy called home, Chris had always been made of stern stuff.

Before him, hovering in perfect array, tiny black Ether-constructs shed long, neat shadows as he worked. Despite the task, his mind absently pondered the logic of his tolerance to the winter's chill.

Shouldn't a reptilian, dragon or otherwise, be extra sensitive to the cold? Shouldn't he feel sluggish and want nothing more than curl up in front of a roaring fire to wait out the bitter season?

Prideful, the dragon within him reared its indignant head, lecturing Chris even as he ran his magical touch briefly over every hovering sphere.

Apparently, dragons had the fire of magic, the very stuff of creation itself burning within them. They were not so limited, so primitive as to require hours of sunbathing merely to move about or digest a meal. Comparison with common lizards was unflattering, Chris should have known.

The young man smiled wryly, pointing out to the preening beast that it had been dozing lazily moments ago. His eye for spotting hypocrisy wasn't appreciated, and he was urged, rather sullenly, to get back to work on their mate's nest. The draconic thought patterns slowed again, lulled by thoughts of curling up beside his mates in this very room.

It was a tempting notion. For a moment, Chris was drawn into the dragon's contented fugue, imagining Petra's warm scales against his back, hearing soft breath by his ear, the quiet little hitch she sometimes made as her lungs swelled full. He could smell Claire nearby and imagined the flickering light the little firebox would shed through its grate.

It lasted only a single, sweet moment, before reality exerted itself. He was back fumbling about in the cold and dark, alone.

In its current state, the grotto wasn't nearly the welcoming sight he hoped to present to Claire and Petra in a few days. It should be warm, softly lit with the small fireplace crackling, not cold and by the harsh tones of his portable lamp. Certainly not until he had a nest of jewels and gold fit for his queens.

Each of the hovering globes before him was tasked to rectify this oversight. There were exactly a thousand of them now, little balls of astounding pressure and temperature held stable by his iron grip on the very fabric of that unseen dimension.

His power over the Ether continued to astonish. Exploring, tinkering, he'd grown ever bolder and more confident since his little extraterrestrial adventure with Hailey. More than anything else, the scale of his manipulations had grown by leaps. He was finally putting his gifts to practical use. If that first use was a little dragon-minded or becoming a touch overused, who was he to naysay?

Eyes closed, Chris reached out, his awareness brushing against orb after tiny orb. He could sense them all abstractly if he concentrated, a neat array of glowing, writhing dots. Sometimes he envisioned them as disruptions, ripple-points in an otherwise placid sea of grey immaterial fabric. Daily his skill at sensing out into the Ether improved under his practice. In his mind's eye, his orbs were as lighthouse beacons compared even to living, breathing things. It was a subtle art, 'dabbling a toe' as Arvil liked to put it.

Every sphere, every one of his Ether manipulations big or small, was connected to him. He felt them all, lurking unobtrusively in the background of his awareness until he paid them direct attention. It was as if he were a fat spider, fingers on every strand of a nascent, interdimensional web. As crazy as that sounded, the network grew every other day as he or Hailey thought up an ever-expanding list of potentially useful experiments. His confidence grew too, his manipulations spreading in secluded places around the country and further afield.

At his mental imperative, three of the dimensional pockets before him rose above the others, traversing effortlessly through thin air to hover over a chipped mug set on the floor nearby. Then as one, all thousand of them opened momentarily, releasing the one element they were otherwise ordered to imprison in solar heat and crushing pressure. Out of each sphere, a tiny, scalding-hot blob of carbon fell into the icy Denver air. They pattered pleasingly, rolling down the growing pile of their siblings that occupied the central depression of the grotto. His dragonesses would soon sleep atop a sea of gold, with diamond-sand shores. Or perhaps he could combine the properties of both somehow.

Chris tracked one gem as it raced down the twinkling mound, skittering to a smouldering stop on the reddish stone just before the toe of his boot. He squatted down, poking curiously with a fingernail until the nasty scent of burning keratin dissuaded him. This batch was just over three millimetres across, nicely smoothed, and contained perhaps the tiniest hint of a yellow tone.

He would have to wait to confirm that after they cooled, but for now he dialled back the temperature inside his little diamond factories by a small mental increment, and then set them back to work.

The three singled-out ones flew back to their positions empty. The mug was a quarter full of reject diamond slivers, glasslike and sharp enough to easily cut his smaller scales. Sometimes they just grew like that, he hadn't figured out why, and he might never. It was sort of comforting, little mysteries like that popping up every now and then to confound him. Whatever the reason, those sharp gems wouldn't do at all for the sort of activity he envisioned.

For a few more moments, he was still, sensing out to the orbs as they set back to work. He received an intimate sense of something trickling in. He knew it was fresh carbon dioxide, but the spheres didn't tell him so in words. That was his own knowledge, instilled by Hailey's lessons. Every CO2 molecule that struck the dark, semi-permeable membranes of their curved surfaces sank through and was trapped. Others, nitrogen, oxygen, and a thousand traces or particulates bounced off like water on a waxed bumper. There wasn't much going in second by second, but over time he would get another batch. If he waited a while, he might feel the temperature-liberated oxygen start to escape the orbs, but he didn't have the time or patience for that.

Content with his creations, Chris sat back on his ever denim-clad behind and began to gather his focus. Mental clarity was vital to his magic, and discipline was key on this scale.

One intense moment of visualisation, a flash of power, and Chris was gone from the grotto, racing through the Ether at the subatomic level. It was time to tend the larger cousins of his little diamond garden.

He hadn't come up with the bed of diamonds on his own; indeed, the notion was a spinoff of one of Hailey's projects. The real project turned out to be one of the easiest and by far the largest, boldest use of his magic that they were getting away with to date.

Arctic wind wrapped freezing fingers around him the instant he phased back, tugging at his clothes, putting Denver to shame. Disorientation and fatigue greeted him too, as it tended to on long jumps. Chris squatted, looking heavenward to breathe deeply of the fresh, icy air. The discomfort passed as his sense of awareness and self re-aligned. A few moments of incorporeality would do that to you. Actually, it was a small price to pay, considering a fundamental breakdown and reassembly by magic and willpower alone.

Overhead, sullen grey skies issued tiny wisps of ice that the wind maliciously flung about to sting his eyes. He took another steadying breath and got cautiously to his feet. Short, robust greenery crunched with soggy snow under his boots. It was just a few cautious steps up to the edge of the majestic bluff, but an extended tumble down to the desolate, rocky shoreline and crashing waves below. He had no intention of ever making the second part of that journey, though once or twice a treacherous dragon-thought revelled in soaring the impressive updraft.

No one with common sense would swim near that jagged, deadly shore. Dark, pounding surf heaved itself endlessly at the stone. The thick, cold smell of it carried to him up the cliff. Out on the choppy swell of the Labrador Sea, a strong current lurked in an uncomfortably close drop-off.

It was a bleak little tip of land overall, and one of thousands just like it. Jagged coast stretched beyond the sea-spray horizon on either side, umpteen miles of it. All narrow islands or twisting fjord. Greenland was a strange, starkly beautiful place. It was the perfect backdrop for a dragon's magical laboratory, and fitting too, at least this particular experiment. What Hailey told him about lagging sea-level changes scared the shit out of him just thinking about. Behind him on the vast landmass, a frighteningly large ice cube was starting to rapidly adjust to the new atmospheric situation.

Arms spread wide, Chris reached out into the Ether, caressing the orbs that hovered near-invisibly over foaming whitecaps. This time at his command, tonnes of beyond-scalding diamonds dropped seaward, seemingly out of thin air. Twenty or more, each the size of small cars, ker-thunked a deep, resounding tone as they hit.

White trails of steam sizzled instantly into existence, bursting skyward with fluffy spray. Despite the violence of the performance, it all was over in moments, and the extraordinary disposal went mostly unremarked.

A stray seabird riding the brisk updraft off the bluffs ruffled a feather in annoyance, circling closer to the disturbance in faint hopes of discovering an easy morsel.

Much later, in the pitch black of the seafloor, a pair of squabbling crustaceans were nearly crushed as one of the wonky carbon lumps rumbled to rest on the muddy bottom. Surrounded by titanic pressure and a slowly settling marine snow, it finally lay still, oblivious to its incarceration. Locked away from the bustle of atmospheric dynamics, with any luck it would stay imprisoned for a few thousand years, perhaps much longer.

Despite the savage beauty of the scene, Chris didn't intend to linger in elements even fouler than what was on offer back home. This was his fourth visit now, the novelty was wearing off. There was just one last orb to check, and it lurked far offshore in the strongest part of the Atlantic-bound current.

This one was a vast sphere, deep underwater and complicated to boot. Chris had to put a lot of thought into how to plan and phrase his conditions. Submarines and their crew aside, there were a host of sea creatures he didn't want to hurt or disrupt in the satisfaction of his lust for gold. But with Hailey reminding him, not to mention the effect new treasures had upon his dragonesses, the opportunity proved tempting.

He'd heard somewhere in the past that the world's oceans contain a vast quantity of dissolved gold. A little research turned up that the figures he'd heard were exaggerated, to say the least. Under normal rules, the trace amounts of gold in seawater were far from economic to extract. In this respect, Chris had some advantages, and so the rulebook was thrown away.

Seawater passed through this orb by the hundred thousand gallons, got mugged of every unbound gold ion, and was kicked back into the current all the poorer. As Chris sensed remotely through his connection to the giant Ether orb, he thought he could finally feel something there. It was faint, but the contents of his largest Ether meddling felt slightly warm to his mental touch, almost comforting in a way that frigid seawater alone most certainly should not. It was working, he'd built an impossibly huge gold-gillnet.

Buoyed by the success, Chris was now keen to get back and see what Stephen was up to with the electricity off. The house had been decidedly warmer and lighter when he'd left yesterday. The goblin trio had promised that the bathroom fixtures and carpeting were nearly done and he wanted to check out how they looked.

Moments later, he was back in the grotto, steadying himself against the domed mural-wall with one outstretched hand. Back to back like that, two long jumps really took it out of him for a few hours, magically speaking. Too much of that would give him a cracking headache.

Leaning near the door as his senses cleared, Chris marked down the morning's events in the spreadsheet program Hailey had shared with his phone. According to his patient, wonderfully endowed instructor, though his actions were just a drop in the bucket on a global scale, it was still good scientific form to keep track of such things.

"And to be clear, Mr. Sibon," the dragon murmured stupidly to himself, smiling as he tapped away at the screen. "I was, of course, referring to your daughter's wonderful gift of intelligence, what else?"

Magical chores ticked off for the morning, Chris collected the lamp and started back through the narrow corridor into his bedroom and busier parts of his new house. He was excited to reveal his work to the brood. Yet, so much expectation had grown around this project now that anxiety swelled in his chest too.

He found Stephen, feet poking out from underneath a shelf in the utility room. Near the end of one long hallway, the room was host to much of the house's plumbing and circulation infrastructure, including a series of tanks containing several days worth of reserve water.

"This HVAC stuff really isn't my forte," the werebison explained as he emerged, only a little bedraggled, to greet Chris. "Yesterday I figured I must have miswired one of the sensors when the damn thing kept turning on and off like that. Couldn't tell which one though, so I'm reconnecting the lot. That's why the power's still out."

"Better you than me," Chris acknowledged his obliviousness to the intricate worlds of circuitry, thermal comfort, and indoor air quality. He'd never imagined how much air movement was healthy for a building this size, nor did he really care to, he was just trying to control the mounting emotion curling inside him. Today might finally be the day, but he still wanted to play it cool in front of Stephen. "Hey, did you hear anything back about the panels for the new fridge?"

"They're speeding their way here on the back of a truck. As fast as money can buy," Stephen grinned at Chris' palpable enthusiasm, his attempts at appearing nonchalant given away as he rocked on the balls of his feet. Clapping a friendly hand on his shoulder, Stephen decided to set the poor lad free and force the issue. "If they arrive today, it will be late."

"Damn. So ... tomorrow?"

"Not necessarily," Stephen added, only a little slyly. "It's basically finished, Chris. Apart from the last of the magical systems, and this crazy walk-in fridge, we're done. The goblins are putting the finishing touches on the bolt-hole as we speak. You could have sprung your big reveal any day this week as far as I'm concerned. The place isn't furnished, so what does a half-installed fridge-room matter?"

"You've met Annabel, haven't you?"

"Heck, I know she wouldn't care less. Don't put it off for that, do it this evening. If the panels arrive, I'll stay late to work on it. It'll give me an excuse to be here when they all see."

"Today?! Are you sure?" Chris frowned, in a way it had been a relief to hear that he could put it off until tomorrow, cowardly as that seemed. "I don't know if I'm ready."

Stephen smirked at the dragon's change of tune, some of the youngster's nerves coming to the surface.

"What's the matter? I'll have this cantankerous thing licked by then." He rapped loudly on the ventilation duct that brought a supply of fresh, pre-filtered air down from the surface. "If I don't, we've got bigger problems anyway."

"I think I'm freaking out a little bit," Chris admitted, taking a purposeful breath as he marshalled an explanation. "I've been looking forward to it for what feels like forever, but if it's done then I have to.... What if they don't like it, Stephen?"

"Then you build another one!" the werebison laughed, turning Chris and starting to lead him back down the hallway. "But look at it all. Think about all the work and time and effort we've put in. All those loads of rock you carted away."

"Please don't remind me," Chris groaned, sticking his head behind the bookshelf in the diamond-shaped-geode-room as he was gently strong-armed by. He could hear goblins up there somewhere in the twisting, narrow stairwell they were carving. It was supposed to be a secret escape hatch, but he was going to have to crab-step the whole way up the damn thing if he ever had to get out that way.

They walked up the protective drop-cloth road, through the expansive living room, straight by the kitchen, headed for the front door. In the entrance room, the burly pair passed the goblin's latest work of exquisite sculpture. Most of the arresting effect was lost because they were headed in the wrong direction, but Chris thought that it might just be his favourite yet.

"My point is," Stephen continued. "There's been a lot of thought, effort, and money put in to accomplishing this. It shows, for anyone who cares to think further than the lack of windows, or perhaps a few of the cheaper fittings. This is a wonderful first home for your strange family, Chris, I'm sure they'll all agree."

"Okay," Chris bobbed his head, still unsure why Stephan was guiding him out. "Thanks, I needed that."

"You're welcome. Now go on, off to your fancy office job and get out of my hair," the werebison laughed. "I don't want to see you again before you show up with the ladies."

"Wha ... when?"

"How about seven? I'll pick up some champagne and bring a few glasses from home. You don't mind if my Better Half tags along?"

"Of course not," Chris was left in a bit of a daze, heart thumping with trepidation and mostly, thankfully, anticipation. "Today? Really?"

"Yes! Now go. Have fun, drag my daughter out of a book. Find a snowman someone else made and take credit for it on the internet. Post a hundred pictures of yourself with it, or whatever it is you kids do for fun these days."

The bank-vault-esque outer door clicked softly locked, and so it was that Chris found himself expelled, temporarily at least, from his own home.

He puttered around upstairs in the warehouse for a while, cleaning and tidying. What the heck were they supposed to do with all that unheated space?

At the very far corner of his property, the escape hatch exit warranted his final inspection before it was covered over amongst the last mounds of magically carved rock. So disguised, and awaiting magical security mechanisms, it should go unnoticed to all but the most determined invaders.

Chris couldn't help looking at the surviving evidence of his toils fondly now. The last few piles of crushed rock created a triangle of neat little mountains in his gravel yard. Without them, who would remember the weeks of back-straining lugging, hours spent damp with sweat and short of breath? Those memories seemed something of the ancient past for him now, other events in his life moving as quickly as they were. Fatherhood especially was never far from his thoughts these days. Susan's dilemma occupied him too, though he distracted himself from confronting it head-on.

Claire had dominated his attention recently, perhaps unfairly, but he just couldn't get over the fact of her remarkable pregnancy. Scientifically, Chris knew that he had nothing to do with making the twins. It was all down to freak chance, a rare and sometimes disastrous occurrence. But a dragon's ego was not an entirely rational thing, and now the propitiously early sundering of those precious cell clusters was being attributed to his draconic advantages. Regardless, all the time spent with his mate let him know her better, and now Chris wanted her even more because of it.

--------------------------------------------
Eventually, after picking a few pieces of windblown trash from his fence, he decided to stop procrastinating around the property and go do something productive. Michelle could be relied on to find something to keep him busy, and if not, there was his stalling rune project to bang his head against.

Chris almost went to Susan, but he wanted a bit more time to get his head straight about what happened that morning. It was on his schedule to pick her up from work that evening anyway. Instead, he braved the windy streets and headed for the Compound, mindful of icy sidewalks.

Phasing would probably have been wise, but the idea of a brisk walk in the elements was now appealing. After two larger jumps like that, it was good to have a bit of a break and some honest physical activity.

He made for the cafe with the little garden that Annabel loved, it had grown on him too now. By the time he arrived, with sodden feet and a reddened nose, he was ready for a warm drink and a snack.

Two waitresses recognised, then fussed to seat him. The proprietor even came out of the kitchen to present the specials, turning the whole situation a bit cringe-worthy in Chris' opinion. He chose a creamy pumpkin soup with dipping bread, as well as a rich, real-chocolate mocha.

The notoriety and special treatment he received was awkward. Glancing around at the other patrons, it was clear he'd been noticed. Eyes lingered in his direction, conversations hushed to whispers as he became the topic of speculation. It seemed everyone in Reyla's territory had seen or at least heard of him by now, the dragon who pooped out magic faster than a unicorn with a bad case of diarrhoea.

He knew now that responding negatively to such attention would almost always go badly for him. Michelle had been trying to explain the psychology of it to him the other day. Chris just couldn't accept the unnervingly subservient looks in some of their eyes. On the other hand, when he thought too long about it, he tended to come to the conclusion that he sounded like a complete dickhead, whining about a few minor drawbacks to his otherwise blessed existence.

Surreptitiously, Chris pulled a tiny, intricately-stoppered vial from his pocket, tapped a few drops of concentrated anti-pheromone potion onto the varnished oak table in front of him. He didn't want to encourage anyone. Celebrity already did strange things to people, and that aspect of his physiology could sometimes blow up into more than a minor drawback.

It just amazed him how some individuals would come right up and start chatting away as if they were lifetime friends. Others seemed to turn meek in his presence, blushing, dithering, or refusing to meet his eyes even during regular interaction, like holding a door or brushing past each other in a shop. It threw him sometimes, and his dragon was no help at all. Having never been particularly outgoing or socially confident, Chris tended to turn inward, attempting to present a calm, rebuffing exterior.

The mocha arrived first, complete with fluttered eyelashes from his victorious waitress. As he enjoyed the first creamy, frothy sips, Chris took out his phone to message the brood. Annabel and Claire had set up a group for them all through Maginet, and he nervously sent out the news that the house would be ready for inspection that very evening.

Moments later, his phone began chirping the receipt of excited replies, and he relaxed to see that they were so enthusiastic. His worries were quite silly, but they felt real enough as they were washed away under a downpour of happy emoticons and digital over-exclamations. The girls fired back messages to each other until his soup arrived, by which time it was agreed that everyone's schedules could bend for the occasion and no one would be left out.

As he ate, he switched to browsing for news of forest fires. He had something special in mind for Claire. With his abilities maturing and experience stacking up, this plan wasn't out of reach if he could catch wind of the right circumstances. While it might be approaching full winter in Denver, in the southern hemisphere, one of the driest, warmest springs on record was simmering quickly into summer. Something was bound to catch ablaze, probably Australia or Argentina, if historical data was anything to go by. The western States were mostly out of danger for now, but next year, after the Revelation, Claire might find her hunger for flame put to the test if California had anything to say about it. For now, though, he just wanted to find her a modest, romantic wildfire getaway.

As if on cue that his time was up, Chris' phone chimed the moment he turned his attention toward fitting soup-spoon to mouth. The distraction proved disastrous, and it took a while to recover from the embarrassment of dribbling creamy-pumpkin down his chin. His cheeks burned as his fellow Beings caught every moment of his hasty cleanup. When Chris finally read the message and learned that his latest order from Reyla's new blacksmith was ready, he wolfed down the rest of his food, paid, tipped, and beat a hurried retreat.

At the back of the cafe, Chris was pleasantly surprised to find the rear garden just as warm and vibrant as it had been that summer. Suddenly he was regretful he hadn't thought to ask about sitting out here. Annabel would be delighted by this, and he was impressed by the glasshouse roof that had been skillfully installed to cover the walled-in area. A curious inspection told him that there was indeed concealed magic involved, but who would notice, human or otherwise, if they could enjoy their breaks in such a lush, peaceful surrounding.

Above, through the heavily slanted planes of glass and subtle spell, he could just glimpse a brightening sky through the windswept snow. The weather was turning in typical Colorado fashion, no doubt the sun would be blindingly bright before long.

The concealed entrance to Reyla's subterranean domain was disguised as an equipment shed at the end of the cafe's decorative gravel pathway. To the side of a quietly burbling fountain, Chris brushed past a veil of hanging ivy and slipped behind a false stone wall. The path narrowed, small bushes and wall-creepers thick around him now, as well as the tingling sense of magic at work.

Chris froze as he pushed aside a low-hanging branch of unseasonably blooming apple that leaned over the concealing fence. There was the dilapidated weatherboard shed and sitting beside it on a wrought iron bench, was the young vampiress, Amanda.

Neither moved for several heartbeats, the vampiress sitting stock-still, not even breathing. The surprise of their meeting was written on her face just as plainly as his own. Chris finally broke the stalemate by relaxing. Memories of their meeting were some of the more haunting from his first days as a dragon, but he was more confident now. A new vampire like her didn't pose a real threat to him any more, not on her own at least. How he would escape this chance meeting socially intact was another matter entirely.

"Hunh, I guess they've got you security types on all the doors and windows these days," Chris finally commented, trying his best to keep things non-awkward and failing wonderfully. He did manage to stop himself from scratching the back of his neck as he looked at her, but only after his hand twitched half-way to complete the treacherous motion. "I guess that makes sense."

"I enjoy this posting," Amanda took a careful breath to reply, the first maddening tickles of his scent invading her nostrils. She could handle this. The darkness inside her stirred, hungry, an involuntary shudder running over her tongue and down her throat. "It lets me get outside in the daytime. Well, mostly. Under the glass is better than nothing."

Thick saliva quickened in Amanda's mouth, and a tightness grew in her muscles, all the way down her neck and across her arms. It wasn't so bad, and she was freshly fed on harvested human blood.

"No invisibility yet? That must be tough," Chris nodded understanding. He was the one building an underground house, but that didn't mean he would ever want to be cut off entirely from the daytime like younger vampires were. "Oh well, I guess I'll be getting along. Things to see, and people to do, ya know? Shit ... I mean things to do and people to...."

Amanda couldn't help it, she actually chortled, an abortive attempt to swallow her own laughter. It was too much to see the giant of a man, all-powerful dragon of growing legend, reduced to this. He was a daily topic in her security briefings, his movements traced and his home constantly under covert guard. She'd felt the immensity of his magical presence more than once, though it was bottled away tightly at the moment. And yet, in an unguarded moment, he was still barely more than a stumbling teenager.

"Damn it," Chris sighed in defeat.

"I'm sorry, that was too funny," Amanda stood but didn't step forward. All she really wanted to do was make sure she hadn't upset him. It would be horrible to make fun of him for the presumably innocent slip-up, but the innuendo couldn't go ignored. "Go on in, please, I didn't mean any offence, but that was too much."

"Yeah, okay, sorry, I guess." Her smile was pretty, eyes crinkled in genuine mirth. It was consoling that someone at least got a little joy from his tongue-trip.

"Don't apologise, Chris," she called out behind him as he squeezed himself through the narrow doorway. "And please warn Lillian off, I fear she'd beat me to a bloody pulp if she smelled dragon on me."

That gave him pause, what would Lillian do in such a situation? He nodded thoughtfully, not yet trusting his ability with words, and began descending the dimly lit stairwell down into the magical heart of the city.

It was funny. Chris was okay with people he knew or had met several times. He was easily intimate with his mates. But in a new or awkward situation, he sometimes just locked up. There were no cues to read, no previous topics to draw on. Sometimes it felt as if he just started spouting nonsense, his tongue on autopilot and barely connected to his brain. Or names slipped by him seconds after introduction. Other times, especially when he was passionate about something, he felt confident, and people usually listened.

Down echoing stairwells, and along spartan well-lit corridors, Chris emerged onto the main concourse. This sprawling underground burrow was Reyla's true domain, and the market section her lifeblood in coin. It was noisy and vibrant with the sounds and smells of people going about their errands.

Something small zipped out from behind a nearby shopper and latched itself to his leg. Chris looked down, amusement mixing with mild alarm, and found a boy looking up at him. Wonder glimmered in those bright, youthful eyes. For a few stunned moments, Chris' thoughts chased themselves in shortening circles.

"Thomas?"

Enthusiastic nodding confirmed it. Chris' recognition met with fervent bouncing from the boy with the barely remembered features.

"You look ... well, better. Not nearly so thin, that's good. Are you howling at the moon these days?"

"Yes, Master Dragon, thank you," the boy spoke, giving Chris a slightly gap-toothed smile. "Thank you, thank you, thank -"

"It's alright, Thomas, seriously. Call me, Chris, remember?" Chris looked around fretfully as shoppers and stall owners alike stopped their commerce to watch. A veritable gaggle was forming, complete with extended necks and bobbing heads. Everyone down here was a Being, or at least an initiated Familiar. They all knew who and what he was, and were eager to gawk, or it certainly seemed that way. "I'm glad I could help so just don't worry about it. You're welcome."

"I promise I'll repay you one day," the boy continued unfazed, eyes worshipful of his towering hero. "I'll help people just like you helped me."

People were staring all right, expectant and waiting to see what the dragon would do. The boy's mother hovered nervously just inside the forming ring of onlookers. She looked like she was stuck between the choice of snatching her emboldened child away for discipline, or prostrating herself before the dragon as she'd done when first appealing for his help months ago. Chris prayed she wouldn't do either.

"Well, Thomas," Chris gently pried the child free of his jeans and slowly squatted so they could talk face to face. "I'm happy you feel that way, and I look forward to hearing all about your good deeds eventually. For now, how about looking after your Mom, alright? You can practice being a little hero for her before you sink your teeth into the rest of the world."

"Okay," Thomas glanced back over his shoulder at her, smiling and utterly oblivious of any wrongdoing.

"That starts with not running away from your mother in a crowd." Mom came forward and placed a calming hand on her child's shoulder. "He's a good boy really, just a little excited to see you again, Master Dragon. It's dragon this and dragon that all the time at home. Sorry."

"Yeah!" Thomas bounced under her hand. "And I can change with the rest of the pack now, it's so cool! You'll have to come with us one time."

"We'll see," Chris cajoled as he stood back up. The crowd bobbed and twittered, smiling nervously at him. It was like Thomas' worshipful eyes were infectious, and though his dragon seemed unphased, Chris just wanted to channel his inner cockroach and scurry off into the shadows.

"I meant to say ... I ... thank you, Dragon," Thomas' mother reached out and brushed a finger against the back of his hand. Big, glistening tears were brimming in her eyes. "It means so much to have Thomas whole again."

"Please, it's fine!" Chris was more forceful now, he really didn't want a repeat performance from her, with added tears. "Look, I've got to get going, but I'm really glad Thomas is okay. Let me know if you need help with anything in the future."

The words were out of his mouth before he realised what he might be committing himself to do. It was just a reflex, a placation to keep them calm and let him escape. Wasn't it?

"You mean it? Truly?" the woman latched on to his public declaration, awestruck by his casual offer of unspecified future aid. The spectators and shopkeepers murmured to each other in agreement, the young dragon's almost legendary generosity given even more credence in their eyes.

"I ... yes." Chris straightened, aborting a sigh as he realised there was nothing reasonable to do but push forward with his hasty promise. His gifts were there to be used after all, not squandered. Burning away Thomas' strange curse was nothing to be ashamed of, helping others was a constructive use of his magic. That was the goal he'd set himself. "Yes. Now, sorry, I really have to go."

"Oh ... I, okay, sorry to hold you. Thank you, Dragon."

"Thank you!" Thomas belted, waving madly from his mother's side.

"It's fine, you're welcome," Chris parroted again, backing awkwardly away down the underground lane of stalls and colourfully pageanted shops. He waved back, he couldn't leave the kid hanging. "See you."

Chris allowed himself a sigh once his escape was secured. He was deep in magical territory now. Down here, amongst the most blatantly undisguisable, Chris felt like a figurehead on the prow of some great ship. Beings parted before him, but he left a churning wake of whispers and curiosity in the flow of magical folk he passed.

These days there seemed to be a surge of new faces and extra bustle every time he walked through the compact mercantile quarter.

The outlandish abounded here, for until recently, no uninitiated humans who ventured into the Compound left with their memories intact. Down here, no one bothered to keep up their disguises unless they felt particularly modest or were just passing through. Whole families of some denizens lived most of their lives in these warm tunnels, rarely venturing out into the human city at all.

Turning left down a side-branch locally referred to as, 'Gnome Alley', Chris passed Reyla's exchange and valuation authority. His understanding was that the people working there filled a similar role to port or customs officials. On the right was the establishment that passed for a bank and post office, complete with a pair of bored security ogres. Their enormous wooden cudgels and magic-nullifying round-shields would make any but the most determined thieves think twice.

The trade of magical goods was regulated, documented, and of course, taxed. There was a whole tier system involved in classifying magical tidbits for trade or barter. It was designed to help keep track of the most dangerous or human-risky items and regulate just about every other conceivable exchange of goods according to Reyla's policies. Chris hadn't yet had time to delve deeper, his direct access to Reyla circumvented most of her protective bureaucratic padding. That was probably one benefit of this strange, near-feudal society. If you were on good terms with the head honcho, the usual red tape barriers tended to fall away.

Chris steamed onward, sliding by goblins, a sleekly furred panther-person, and a hovering trio of fairy folk, to list only the most notable. There was even a comically stereotypical orc, leaning arms crossed against a wall with a fearsome scowl on his blunt, underbitten features. Her features?

A blacksmith was hard to disguise in any city centre these days, let alone a genuine dwarven smith. So was an honest-to-goodness tannery and leatherworks, complete with staggeringly awful smells. But down here, in the heart of the Compound, person or profession need not hide.

The distinct ping of anvil and hammer could have guided his steps if he didn't already know the way. Chris felt that he might be slightly abusing his status with the newly arrived dwarves. Sure, they'd come all the way there in the hope of obtaining cheap crystals. He didn't think they'd planned on him pouncing and filling their docket with work the instant they opened shop.

That was precisely what he'd done, too. Their skills were just too handy not to monopolise right now. His first attempt at even basic forging of metals had convinced him not to stick his nose into yet another undiscovered world dominated by specialised knowledge, skill, and years or even centuries of experience. Therefore the newly gilded smith bore the brunt of his latest foray into the realm of practical magic.

Ever since Reyla had pointed him toward runes, Chris had been searching for ways to compensate for his abysmal grasp of spells requiring concerted concentration. The specific focus of mind, and measured application of magic required for manifesting most spell-fields by mental intent still far outstripped his discipline. Even basic shields and magical barriers were mostly beyond him. Though for the few moments he could maintain his concentration to raise one, they were potent.

Reyla had hinted it might take millennia to achieve the desired effect with his usual casting method, so he was determined to find another way.

He owed it to himself, to Annabel, Immi, and the rest of the brood to come up with a way to better defend himself. He also felt he owed some security to his colleagues at the fledgeling BIA who were already venturing deeper into magically dangerous situations.

He'd never forgive himself if little Amy was forced to deal with her mother's loss, even injury, by magic. Not if he hadn't yet tried to help provide some sort of protection. That was his job, after all, to provide magical support and advice. Who would tease him at work if something happened to Kat or Lisa? He owed the attempt to his brood, and to Susan after what she'd been through.

Therefore, with the help of his newfound economic might, two highly trained magical metalworkers were conscripted toward solving the first aspect of his runic problem, material. The second aspect, the occult aspect, was unfortunately still pending a success of some sort.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
As promised, Chris' orders were waiting when he arrived at the smithy. Wrapped plainly but neatly in brown waxed paper, most would never suspect the wealth of precious metal within.

The blacksmith and his cousin were always very careful to account for every milligram of his gold lost in each re-forging process. It wasn't even pure dragon gold, just a blend, but they still professed it a great honour to be entrusted to its work and care.

Each time Chris returned with his melted failures, ready to be liquified and cast again, they brought out a ledger and measuring scales. Meticulous care was taken to weigh every magically slagged scrap of his experiments. Apparently, their two species had some bad blood a while back, and the two dwarves were desperate to prove their trustworthiness.

Along with his package of blank, golden, scrabble pieces, he received three tiny spools of dainty jewellery chain, gold, mithril, and copper. Those were the painstaking work of Esma the Busty, who fussed happily over the two freshly juiced-up crystals he exchanged in payment for her meticulous craft.

"Will ya be needing the same again, Master Dragon?" The journeyman smith, Kyle, asked. His singed beard was being pulled absently through a massive, calloused fist as he pondered his next words carefully. "It's just, well, you've been at it for a while now. Perhaps runecraft isn't for you, and I feel bad taking your crystal each time. I mean no disrespect, of course."

"You might be right," Chris admitted, pausing as he collected his weighty little handful and prepared to depart for a brief stint of research in Reyla's library. "If I knew why I was failing, it might be easier to give it up and move on. I don't, though. I mean, I'm no expert on runes, but I'm playing things mostly by the book. The symbols and the metal seem to channel magic just fine. It's activating a completed phrase that mostly gives me an expensive, hot puddle."

"Your magic is wild and powerful," the dwarf nodded thoughtfully. "Could be fight'n to stay free, rather than bound to a rune. Keep your runes simple, and I'll wager you'll find success soon enough."

"Free?" Chris' eyebrow rose.

"Aye, free. Powerful magics don't always appreciate being locked away in a chunk of gold, dragon or no dragon. Especially when that dragon doesn't truly know his runes."

"Huh. But it's <em>my</em> magic," Chris half complained. "I'm not doing anything groundbreaking, just ... complicated. Anyway, thanks for the advice, I'll see you later, Kyle."

"Well, you know best, I'm sure. I'll be starting on the next batch then." The smith smiled and shook his bushy head almost fondly. He hopped off the wooden crate behind his counter and rounded toward the depths of his hot, noisy workspace.

Kyle had always been forward amongst his clan, never hesitating to speak his mind. However, it wouldn't do to go pointing out too bluntly that the young lump was butting his great magical skull against a wall. If the dragon couldn't take a hint and wanted to keep strutting into his shop every other day, let him. It was doing wonders for his fledgeling business reputation, not to mention the gemstones. Great forge below, the beautiful, verdant gemstones. Working with such plenty of eager, new magic was a wonder. For the first time in his life, Kyle appreciated the sorrowful tones of the clans' eldest forge masters when they spoke or sang of times long past, when magic abounded.

It was nearing midday when Chris eventually popped out into the 'real world' again, leaving Reyla's little subterranean kingdom behind. An exit conveniently close to the BIA headquarters was becoming one of his regular haunts, allowing him to emerge in an old bookstore run by an elderly wizard and witch. He planned to run upstairs to his desk, drop off his paper-wrapped cargo, and see if anyone could be persuaded away for lunch.

As it happened, there was no need for any persuasion. By the second floor stairwell, Chris could hear the team coming down. By the footfalls and rebounding tones of their conversation, it might even be the whole crew. He decided to be a little dorky as he waited, mostly for Michelle's benefit, and struck an exaggerated pose leaning against a wall.

Michelle stopped abruptly as she rounded the third-floor landing, catching sight of Chris below, half-splayed against the back wall in a rediculous photoshoot-pose, a stupid grin on his face. She felt the others bump to a halt behind her, already beginning to laugh at the sight of him.

"You ladies looking for company?" Chris tried in his best sleazy-smooth-guy, flicking his head up ridiculously to stare right at the leader of the little group; his beautiful, cunning, intelligent, sexy Michelle. He saw her nostrils flare just slightly, her eyes widening in what he hoped was a combination of desire and mirth. That was his goal anyway.

Lisa couldn't contain her cackle at the sight of him. Beside Michelle, Kat gripped the rail as her shoulders shook. Michelle would have laughed at him too, but his eyes skewered her to the spot. Her heart thumped jauntily, and the rest of her body warmed with a flood of endorphins and anticipation.

No one was prepared for Amy. The youngster bowled through their legs from the back of the group and literally flew down the stairs.

"Chrrrriiiis?!!" the young girl squealed in unrestrained excitement, the sound echoing up and down the entire stairwell as a discordant shriek. Launching herself off the fourth to last stair, Amy went truly airborne as Samantha let out a cry of alarm from above.

Chris saw the Amy-missile coming and dropped his cargo in time to make the catch. She was so lightweight that it was near-effortless, and so he spun her upside down once for good measure. She was a feather compared to Lillian vaulting off the walls at him in training.

"What are you doing here, Munchkin?" Chris asked as her giggles subsided, genuinely confused as to why she was out of school at this particular time, or here at the BIA building.

"It's Saturday, silly," Amy beamed back, settling herself happily against his hip. "We're going out for lunch!"

"Huh, Saturday, really? So it is. Guess I lost track," Chris mused. "It's been a hectic week, ya know?"

"Amy don't do that," Samantha scolded her way down the steps, followed more subduedly by the others. Lisa and Kat were still snickering, Pamella and Michelle quietly bringing up the rear.

"It's okay, I don't ... mind?" Chris started, sensing by Sam's deepening frown that it wasn't the right response.

"I'm worried about her falling down the stairs and breaking her neck, Chris," Amy's mom fussed back, a little more sharply than she'd intended. "Sorry, I don't mean to bite off your head, Chris, but ... Amy, you scared me when you pulled away like that. You can't go doing that or Mom is going to go grey early!"

"But it's Chris," Amy protested as she was gently put down, as if his involvement explained everything away.

"Must be assault the dragon with minors day, or something," Chris muttered to himself as the others closed in and Amy got a gentle, yet firm talking to.

"I know you're excited, sweetie, but don't let it get away on you. If you'd done that in the street you might get hit by a car or something, okay?"

It looked like a little stormcloud formed over the youngsters head, her eyebrows scrunched in an adorable scowl.

"I know, Mom, I'm seven now. Okay?!"

The sheer sass of it stunned everyone, Amy was usually so demure and well-behaved.

"Preach it little-sister," Kat smirked as Chris began chuckling nervously.

"Kat, enough," Michelle warned softly.

"We'll talk about this later, young lady," Samantha eyed her daughter warningly for a long moment.

Amy still looked peeved but took her mother's offered hand to hold.

"And what have we got here?" Kat moved on, ignoring the awkward parenting episode entirely as she picked up the packaged lump that had made such a thud when Chris dropped it. It resisted unexpectedly, and she tightened her grip for a second try. "Jesus, it's heavy."

"Don't unwrap ... fine do whatever, I guess," Chris shook his head as a small flip-blade materialised in Kat's fingers. Ignored, it's point slit through the layers of paper wrapping with a single rasping flick.

"More gold? Are you fu..." Lisa gawped to a halt, glancing guiltily at Sam and Amy before continuing. "Are you serious, man?"

"Mostly the same gold, actually," Chris watched as Kat passed the neat stack of thin gold tiles over for inspection. Lisa hadn't wrapped her head around the seemingly casual use of precious gemstones and metals in the broader magical community, let alone Chris' own lavish tendencies.

At barely more than fifteen millimetres across and four thick, his squares weren't too exorbitant on their own. Piled up in a three by six by six cuboid stack, they represented a lot of wealth, with a satisfying heft. That valuation didn't factor his unique magic either, blended as the gold was with approximately one in ten parts dragon-gold.

"You just ... just walked over here with that, didn't you? Again?" Lisa accused with a jabbing finger to his bicep, glancing between him and his magical ingredients, half amazed, half disgusted. "You really should have one of us as an escort, there are people out there that wouldn't think twice about stabb -"

"Keep it PG, Lisa," Pamela pointed out at the back of the group, noting that Amy listened, ever intent.

"Right, I mean ... hugging you up, and booking you into a five-star dumpster. You get the point?"

"Yes. It was a bit long-winded, but it sounds as though I'll just have to come to lunch with you, that way you can maintain the appropriate chain of custody for such potent, rare, magical artifacts. Safety first and all that, I accept," Chris grinned mischievously at the group, darting his attention to the chastened youngster as she peeked at him from behind Samantha's hip. It was good to see her mood was already recovering.

Lisa almost snorted in exasperation at his almost simpering delivery and thrust his blank rune tablets back into his hands. The slitted paper made them unruly to carry now, as well as heavy.

"We were actually just headed out for a bite. Want to come along?" Michelle asked, receiving nods of approval from the rest of her team.

"Of course, you know me."

"Yay!" Amy chirped, emerging from behind her mother, reaching to claim Chris' freed hand.

"Bottomless Baryst," Lisa harrumphed, though no one was fooled that she was honestly in a bad mood. "I'm sure glad I don't have to feed him."

"Let's try to keep things at least marginally professional," Samantha sighed as if resigned to the antics of her younger colleagues and her suddenly back-talking daughter.

"Okay, let's move, people," Michelle agreed, starting their descent again.

Michelle knew she wasn't really kidding anyone in this little group. She was 'getting boned good and regular' as Kat might have put it. They all knew it, but anyone in the building could walk in on them here in the stairwell. She was reluctant to provoke fate any further with unrestrained chitchat. Kat didn't know any better or just couldn't help herself with the teasing. So far though, she'd been loyally discrete whenever it really counted. Everyone had, and Michelle couldn't ask for more.

Behind her, the rest of the team took up positions and resumed their progress down the stairwell. Amy began pleading for a shoulder ride, then squealed as in counter-offer, Chris instead threatened to hold her over the railing. He never made good on that, thank goodness, but apparently, his attempts were credible and quite exhilarating. Michelle glanced back to Lisa as they rounded the balcony below, noticing her brooding expression.

"Seriously Lisa, relax. I've tried that one with him before, and he won't have it. He doesn't want to be herded around when he's off the job. But I think we don't have to worry too much, you've seen him in action. He's progressed a lot, he learns quickly."

"Yeah, I guess I know what you mean," Lisa admitted, glancing to Pamela to see if she was supported. "It's hard to know what to do, how to protect someone who is quite capable on their own, and in ways I don't understand ... I just, hmmm."

"It's like being told to guard a lion or a tank, or something," Kat agreed, piling down the stairs in a hurry to join the conversation as Chris, Sam and Amy brought up the rear in their own bubble. "In that vehicle evacuation drill yesterday, he just picked Lisa and me up under each arm and sprinted for the safe zone like a runaway linebacker. It's not really in the spirit of things."

"That's a good way of thinking about it, actually," Pamela said, looking down to her amazingly healed leg, a constant reminder that she now moved in a crazy world of magic and fey possibility. In the span of a few weeks, she'd experienced first hand how magic flawlessly mended a life-changing injury. "His needs and weaknesses are unique, we have to acknowledge and work with them."

"Yeah, but I still say he's a prime target for a mugging," Lisa groused as they piled out of the stairs onto the ground floor. "One of his weaknesses is that he's such an airhead sometimes."

"It might be fun to watch someone try mugging him," grinned Pamela wickedly. Though the expression was somewhat sinister, it still brightened her freckled, sun-touched features immeasurably. "He's been steaming for a fight since Susan got robbed."

"The guys upstairs are dying to see him in action," Kat enthused. "Our body-cam footage from Brazil was the hottest shit for a while there."

"Really?" Michelle wondered, a little surprised by the sentiment. She caught a dangerous glint in the younger woman's eye and spoke to preemptively snuff out the kindling spark of mischief. "And you will in no way, shape, or form orchestrate a fake mugging, Kat. In case that actually needed to be said."

"Ha, it was only an idea," The younger woman admitted with a half-shrug of powerfully-built shoulders. "I bet Carlos would be up for it. He says we're hogging all the fun assignments."

"Not many others are actually seeing much magic yet, not the big stuff anyway. None of what they do see is on our side either," Lisa added.

"I'm always getting asked for stories about our dragon," Pamela agreed as they continued downstairs, almost to the lobby now. "He's like the office mascot, the other branches are a little jealous."

"They'll get a chance. With the way things are shaping up, we'll have to loan him out in the future," admitted Michelle. In an ideal world, she would have more time to familiarise him with the staff and workings of the new government agency. "But that's why I hired four full-time dragon-sitters, isn't it? To lubricate his integration and deployment."

Lisa groaned, remembering her last episode of dragon-sitting.

"Yes! Bring on the midnight extortion and vamp-strippers!" Kat laughed low, holding her fists high but keeping her voice from reaching the guards on duty at the front desk.

"It's my turn next," insisted the freckled markswoman, surprising the others with her enthusiasm. "What? The last time sounded like a blast, even Lisa had a good time."

"I did not!"

On the spacious lobby floor, their joking quieted. Final preparations of coats, hats, glasses, and gloves were mandatory to venture out into the cold, yet suddenly dazzling sunshine. Fresh snow crunched, and the old stuff slushed under their feet. Foot traffic was light, so they had full reign of the sidewalk. An impromptu snow fight almost broke out between Amy, Kat, and Chris, but the wiser of the group reined them in.

Chris outdid himself at lunch, eating his way to the bottom of a massive bowl of creamy broccoli soup. The bowl itself was made from a hollowed-out loaf of bread, so that disappeared too. Then he finished a garlic-butter-drowned rib eye steak, because when the waiter walked by with one for another table, he couldn't resist the smell.

"My body is a furnace," he protested guiltily under the half commending, half jealous glances of Samantha and Lisa.

Only later did he partially regret the steak. The garlic came back for a second visit, pungent burps as he sat at his desk in the mostly-deserted BIA office that afternoon.

Copying precise runic symbols onto his gold tiles with an engraving tool was an exacting process, and being ambushed by garlic burps wasn't ideal. But he judged it was worthwhile, that steak had been done just right.

With some big morning meeting out of the way, a lot of the regulars at the BIA had gone home to enjoy their well deserved time off. That suited Chris, and it meant he could work on his project with less distraction. Kat and Michelle were around somewhere, busy keeping an eye on a developing situation involving a suspected arms deal or some such.

Chris etched away tile by tile, his desk protected by a sheet of rough ply-board and illuminated by a construction lamp he'd borrowed from Stephen. Two of Reyla's borrowed books sat propped open against his cubicle wall, depicting the exact characters and proportions he was attempting to inscribe to the miniature golden tablets.

His tool caught in the soft gold as he tried to complete the curved loop of an elf-derived wind-rune. A muttered string of garlicky curses followed as he attempted to cover his mistake with extra scratches. Eventually, Chris discarded the tile as a failure and began afresh on a new one.

Runes weren't turning out to be the easy solution he'd hoped they might be. They may as well have been a language of their own, complete with semi-pictographic letters, grammar nuances, and experts who loved to put their own slant on everything.

The air rune he'd just botched, for instance, was supposed to be a derivation of the ancient elven symbol for howling wind. However, his two reference books disagreed on how to draw it, what use it should be best put to, and what material and magics it would best work with.

All Chris wanted to accomplish today was a magical function that could recognise an approaching force or pressure. For example, the blast force someone might be exposed to in close proximity to an explosion.

That shouldn't have been so hard, but back in yonder year when great-granddaddy elf and pappy dwarf were arguing about such things and writing their books, they had only the dimmest understanding of anything resembling modern physics or chemistry. They certainly hadn't had any experience with plastic explosives.

They might have known about other such substances Chris assumed, black powder or perhaps nitroglycerine. Magically triggered or powered bombs weren't exactly new on the scene from his research. However, the author's understanding of the forces and physics involved weren't anything close to modern standards.

For example, instead of a symbol for blocking kinetic energy, the books contained hundreds of separate runes designed to protect against thrown rocks, arrows, darts, even sword strokes. There were just as many if not more entries documenting how best to launch said missiles at one's enemies, too.

Worse, when runes were combined into phrases, every rule seemed to fly out the window as far as Chris could tell. Rune combinations which accomplished mostly the same thing might look nothing alike in different applications. The rune combination on a ring purported to slow incoming arrows looked nothing like the pictographic phrase on a bracelet that let the wearer fall gently from great heights. It was essentially the same thing, the exact same forces involved, and yet the suggested runes were utterly different.

Chris couldn't understand why.

It was as if Hailey's efforts to enlighten him to the world of science were now a barrier to his comprehension of this semi-artistic branch of spellcraft. He couldn't see a system, and so he rebelled against the seeming lack of regularity, the illogic of the magical.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 7|
--------------------------------------------
Understanding something on a fundamental level fueled his mind to open to new ways of thinking, spawning new ideas and solutions. In this instance, he had plenty of ideas that might eventually bloom into practical spells. However, translating those ideas into workable rune-phrases was becoming increasingly frustrating as his efforts were met with failure after failure.

Chris had had successes. He'd handled something easy, like stopping bullets, already. But that wasn't all he was trying to protect against.

One of his only working creations, the pride of his meagre successes was, in fact, a functioning bullet deflector. All it took was three correctly-inscribed rune-tiles, threaded together by tiny chains. A small gem could be attached to provide magical energy, enough for a few bullets anyway.

He'd already hung the sparkly little device at the back of the firing range and told Kat to do her best. It was impossible to hit. Bullets shied away to either side, literally by magic. It was pretty efficient too because it didn't try to directly slow the projectiles, only nudge them aside. It was cool, but actually quite limited in its usefulness when a Kevlar vest could accomplish a similar end result. It was also potentially very dangerous for anyone to either side of the device.

He'd had a few successes with some other basic shielding too, he could make a rune phrase to deflect weak light, absorb heat from the surrounding air, or generate heat in return. That last one amounted to the world's most expensive, arcanely convoluted hand warmer, so Chris was understandably disappointed.

Basically, if he kept the intended functions simple, and copied them right out of the book, his attempts would mostly work as expected.

Problem was, he didn't want simple, and he didn't want hand warmers. Even vivid illustrations of a suped-up, fire-proof, arrow stopping battle-carriage from half a millennia ago were of dubious value.

Chris imagined something elegant, sophisticated, and most importantly, practical.

Kat or Lisa couldn't carry around huge jangling satchels of bulky rune devices wherever they went into the field. Magical or mundane, danger wouldn't wait patiently for them to sift about and find the right bracelet or ring to mount a defence. He needed to come up with something multifunctional, something that was as close to an all-in-one protection system as he could make.

Actually putting any of those ideas into practice was turning out to be far trickier than he'd hoped. Not only was his runic alphabet lacking, but his nomenclature was also probably laughable. Every time he activated more than four or so runes at once, his painstaking efforts usually turned to slag and nasty smoke.

That was sort of a huge stumbling block in his attempt to make what amounted to a runic logic engine, or circuit board, complete with magical sensory input and pre-programmed responses.

"Perhaps this is all too ambitious," he mused to no one, putting down the scoring tool to rest his achy fingers. Gold was soft, but it wasn't that soft.

Around him, the office area purred away quietly. Dogged even on a Saturday afternoon, Agent Racema was over at the water-cooler, making it glug as he took a break from his screens and satellite imagery. Chris had been in the BIA office long enough now that all its sounds were becoming familiar, fading into the background while he worked.

This second attempt at the air rune was much better. His work with the tools was smooth and neat after a few minutes to relax. The magic he imparted to the gold tile now held an imprint, a pattern or idea ready to act when powered.

Satisfied with a final look over, Chris began threading it onto the rune-phrase he'd been working on for the best part of the last hour.

For thread, a fine strand each of gold, mithril, and copper jewellery-chain linked the little rune tablets in a magical trifecta.

Each metal added its own channel or aspect of connection, and each tile was linked by two of these tri-strands for redundancy. With special holes drilled lengthwise underneath the inscribed face at either side, all he did was shake the little chains down each hole and tie them off. The drilling and chain-making itself was delicate work, worthy of expert Dwarven hands.

Chris pushed the golden tile along the two mini-triple-chains until it clacked gently into place against the others. The inscribed magical information on that tile could now, in theory, be read, powered, transferred, then magicked? Acted-on ... manifested? That's how he pictured it might work anyway. He wasn't all that sure.

With six runes in this phrase, hopefully, he had a novel shield function on his hands. According to his research and subsequent planning, this combination might solidify an aligned triangular column of air molecules around the bearer.

Such 'air-freezing' was a relatively common technique in the magical community, but he hoped to vastly improve upon its efficiency. Outright absorbing the impact of a magical blast or conventional explosion was incredibly costly. Magically or mundanely speaking, there was just a lot of force involved.

His idea was based around deflecting much of that energy to either side, just as with the bullets. By presenting a shaped field of magically solidified air toward the source, instead of a flat plane or bubble, less of that force would have to be directly countered. In theory, it should be a far more efficient way to approach the situation. He had absolutely no idea if it would work. Given that the phrase was more than four runes long, his odds weren't good.

However, even if he got it right, this was still just a 'dumb' shield sigil. The wearer still had to carry it, recognise the right situation to use it, and most importantly, activate it in a timely manner. For one of his non-magical colleagues, it would be next to useless. Without other complementary charms, and most importantly, some way to magically coordinate, they would have no hope of activating it in time to help.

The elevator doors pinged softly, and Chris paused mid-thought. Instinct kicked in, and he rose in his seat as the skin on the back of his neck started to tingle. If he were a dragon, he supposed his crest spines would have been standing on end.

His nose told him who had come to visit before he got a chance to look over the cubicles.

It wouldn't have done him any good. The honeyed scent of lusty vampire was thick on the proverbial wind. Chris grinned, he felt a lurch downstairs. Apparently, the thrashing he'd received yesterday was forgiven, though he suspected he was just a glutton for that sort of punishment.

Lillian's approach was near-silent, experienced by Chris more as a familiar tickle against his preternatural senses. Only someone listening very carefully could pinpoint her by the light scuff of her boots on the carpet, or the swish of fabric against swaying hips.

They were both still for a long moment when she rounded into his cubicle. Chris' smile broadened as he sat there with his back to the invisible monster, knowing precisely what she desired. It would be fun seeing what angle she took to achieve her carnal goals today.

Resistance was ultimately futile, but it might prove fun in the short term.

A faint rustle, a few light steps, and then her warm lips were feathering the base of his neck. There was a happy sigh of hot breath against his skin, and sly, invisible hands looped down onto his chest, caressing delicately, scratching.

Concurrently, his head was buoyed forward, suddenly afloat in an overflowing bounty of wonderful, naked, invisible, breast-flesh. A stiff, pebbly nipple brushed past his ear, whisking across his jaw. Held invisibly in such an unexpected and epic boob-lock, Chris' breath rushed between his teeth in a low, almost pained groan of arousal.

"Mhhhh, yes, indeed," Lillian purred in response, resting her chin in his hair. "Hard at work, aren't we, my sweet, studly dragon. Is that my trouser-friend I see down there? Is he ready for playtime?"

"Tits!" Chris croaked back, his mouth suddenly salivating as he was pulled deeper into warm voluptuousness on all sides. "My only weakness, how did you know?"

"I suppose there have been clues for a while," she teased back, leaning further over him to watch as her hand trailed slowly, torturously down his tummy toward her prize. "It must have clicked last night when you tried to bite my poor nipples right off."

"Well, you did ask for it."

"Yes, young one, I certainly did. Now, if you could oblige, dispense with the pants and fuck me until I can't see straight?"

Chris' poor penis throbbed, weeping silky pre-fluids to hear such a forthright proposition. To make matters worse, her telekinetic touch settled on the fabric of his bulging pants, dancing upward toward the root of his tumescent shaft. When she got like this, he knew she could happily torture him up and down toward the brink of climax almost indefinitely.

"I don't know," Chris fought valiantly to resist her allure, to keep some sort of upper hand in this spiralling little mating dance. "I'm sort of in the middle of something here."

"If silly runes are all that's in the way of my ravishment, I suppose I could be persuaded to provide some insight."

It felt so good, so warm, he could quite happily jiggle away into the sunset on such a sea of breasts. He could feel Lillian's voice through her chest, ears smothered as they moulded to her warm, pale skin. They were in the middle of his BIA cubicle for god's sake, but if Lillian could genuinely help with runes, he needed to hear it.

"Wait, wait, wait ... hold on with the tits, Lillian, be serious. What do you know about runes? I thought vampires weren't good with magic?"

"We aren't, generally," the vampiress pouted as Chris pulled himself partially out of her unseen grasp. "But I don't understand why you're struggling on and on with the basics. There's a perfectly eager little sprite who could be doing the runework for you. It might free up more of your time for ... other pursuits."

His cock was treated to another poignant magical caress, in case the sledgehammer of her innuendo hadn't already broken through. Chris put aside the shiver of pleasure aroused by her expert touch, momentarily stumped that he'd never considered recruiting Immi on this project.

"Hmm, I thought she leaned more toward incantation? Though I suppose she did teach Annabel and Bartholomew using a few runes."

"You never thought a fey princess might have received a thorough education in both written and spoken aspects of magical language?"

"No, I guess I didn't," Chris confessed, relaxing back into her arms as his mind teased at the rush of new possibilities blossoming within it. "It's not bad etiquette to put a sprite to work or anything, is it?"

"Only unwillingly," Lillian laughed. "Besides, that mad she-bat would do just about anything to please you. She's not going to complain about long, sweaty hours together, slowly drawing out your magic again, and again. You seem more than proficient at magical transfer. I've got a few hours free right now, we could practice if you like."

"Oh, really?" Chris leaned back against Lillian's naked torso, feeling the power and strength caged within, as well as every inch of soft tit.

"Call it my fee for a magical consultation," the big vampiress almost purred.

"Maybe," Chris continued their game just a little longer. With Lillian of all his mates, he tended to exalt in the unrestrained once the dam of sexual tension finally burst. They were racing headlong down the familiar path that led right to loud, rampant sex, the moaning and pounding variety. "I mean I should probably go find Immi and ask her about all this, shouldn't I?"

The vampiress hissed dangerously.

"Young one, I didn't want to pull out the big guns. You're just intractable, aren't you?" Lillian tsked, ghostly fingers playing teasing shapes on his navel through his shirt. "But, very well ... the real reason I interrupted your vital work this afternoon is that we have a developing security situation on our hands. You see it's quite embarrassing, but a rather large, rather greasy, hunk of silicone seems to have taken up residence in my bottom. I should think a respectable, upstanding dragon might have something to say about that sort of blatant encroachment on his territory."

Chris' head jostled excitedly between her boobs, he needed to remember to breathe and did so shakily. Her telekinetic finger just eased off on tickling the underside of his rampant cock. He was a glutton alright, and happy with the fact. There was nowhere he'd rather be right now than worshipping Lillian's big, busty body in ways Annabel's mother would definitely disapprove of.

"Yes, I see, in that case, it would be my pleasure to evict this scoundrel myself. How on earth did this occur?"

Lillian's lips nibbled the shell of his ear victoriously. She was just as worked up as he was for the real play that was about to begin.

"You've got fifteen seconds to get us to my bedroom, then I'll show you."

***

The bleak, snow-blown parking lot in front of Eddard's Apothecary made Susan shiver just looking at it. It was her turn to man the counter in the last shift before closing today. From where she sat behind the glass top display cases, she was in for a freezing, soggy journey home. The winter sun from earlier that afternoon was gone now, taking with it any chance of her mood lightening. As if making the walk didn't hold enough emotional torment on its own, being forced to confront the scene of her humiliation.

Life as a sueth-azoah host was a daunting prospect, and being stuck inside a gloomy shop surrounded by wind and winter felt like icy, leaf-curling imprisonment. It felt like barely more than a week since she was mugged and made her impulsive pact with that strange seed. Susan and the ancient semi-parasitic jungle creeper were still blundering through introductions, unfamiliar with each other and their new, shared existence.

Never in her wildest dreams could Susan have imagined sunlight, or the lack thereof, suddenly playing such a massive role in her life. Being trapped inside behind the counter while its beautiful rays drizzled down outside was torturous. Like now, when it was gone for the day, she sometimes caught herself falling into the sueth-azoah's background moping. It had its own sluggish feelings and dislikes, and they bled through into her unless she was consciously mindful. Denver's chilly days recently were hardly fun, but now she abhorred the cold almost as a physical pain.

Stranger was her new body, and she was only just scratching the surface there. Digging too far and finding something unpleasant was at the bottom of her list right now. She'd already found out that she no longer bled, just wept a slightly milky fluid for a few moments until the wound closed over. Combined with creepy vines and the episode where she'd literally sprouted roots and burst into bloom, it was enough weirdness for the moment without going hunting for more.

The wisps of sluggish, alien thought that sometimes brushed the back of her consciousness were the strangest. Her dreams were single-minded, all dank, mouldy humus, thick leaf litter, and moist, rich soil. The sun, the swaying trees around her, she dreamed of sucking it all down. Woe to any forest creature who strayed too close under the weeping branches of the host, their corpses would fertilise her roots.

"Let's swap, Susan. Go on out the back, I'll finish the day out here." Rowan shuffled into the front room with a cup of warm tea cradled between knobbly fingers. "You were staring off into nowhere again, go do something that will keep your mind ticking over. How are those two little rascal bulbs anyway?"

"Oh, Rowan, thank you. The ditríff are doing well, I think. Slow progress is good progress." Susan smiled softly as he shuffled around behind the counter with her. "You know it's funny, I was just musing on how this whole mess has changed me, fundamentally I mean. I barely feel like the same me any more."

"Absolute hogwash." The old fellow rattled his cup down on the countertop and gave her chair leg a little kick with one of his slippers. "Now get out of my nice warm seat unless you want to stay here and listen while I dissect this latest nugget of self-pity in detail. I'll debunk it all over again, you'll see!"

"No, I don't think I'd survive another round of that," Susan considered ruefully as she relinquished the seat. "Thank you, Rowan, for everything."

He grumbled something gruff and appreciative as she exited, swishing through the bead-curtain leading back into the herbarium.

If her bargain with the sueth-azoah had an upside at all, it was in her green thumbs. Her plants almost sang to her now. Their needs and wants seemed painfully evident with even a glance or touch. Already she'd adjusted unseen nutrient deficiencies, predicted and vanquished an outbreak of thrips, and been forced to re-think her entire approach to humidity regulation. A simple brush of one of her new tendrils and it was as if the inhabitants of her potted garden spilled their whole life stories for her alone to hear. And she now understood, too. She'd always had her gift, shared and nourished by her grandmother, but this was a transcendence of her ability, an order of magnitude jump in acumen.

Surveying her verdant subjects always calmed her, the swirling stresses and worries of her mind quieting in response. She belonged out under the big lamps, surrounded by moist heat and the fresh, crisp aromatics of sweating leaves. Today more than ever, Susan felt it right down to her chilly toes, a Colorado winter was no place for a sueth-azoah.

An overflowing verbena shrub stood gatekeeper to the main pathway between the rows, squeezed into place at the last minute to share space and lamp-light in the increasingly crowded warehouse. Susan was just brushing past, deep in the crisp lemon scent of its scratchy leaves when some tingle of awareness brought her up short and she halted in her tracks.

It was the passenger, Susan realised, though its shared sensations didn't often intrude so forcefully. Whatever feelers the sueth-azoah dangled in the swirling, unseen eddies of magic were very sensitive, almost pervasive. Chris' control of his magical aura might be improving admirably, but no magical denizen would get the jump on her these days.

Susan turned, and there he was. Chris, leaning across the beaded doorway, just as casually as the hilarity of his size would allow. The goofy smile he gave as she faced him shattered the hardened lump of depression in her chest. Suddenly all the bottled angst from their aborted contact that morning seemed to boil up out of the pit of her stomach.

She must have looked frightful, because Chris was aghast, opening his arms in invitation.

Susan actually ran at him, colliding in a bruising tackle that rocked a backward step out of the worried young dragon.

"I'm sorry about this morning, it wasn't right," Chris soothed, leaning over, so his lips were against her ear as they hugged crushingly. "I've been thinking about it all day ... well, okay not the last few hours but what I mean is this. Damn, bear with me on this ramble, okay?"

Nodding, she squeezed her teary eyes shut, arms clinging around his neck.

"I thought back to that day when Petra and I mated, and my dick got stupid big, you didn't even hesitate to support me and ... I ... I guess I'm trying my best to be that way for you now."

Susan longed for him, her body cried out its need to be held and touched as they used to. Just pressing against him, just feeling the rumble of his voice had her nipples crinkling like mad. Her chlorophyllic passenger was eager to sample him too, that was clear now. It had the taste of him, and it scared her to know how much she wanted to push roots down into him and feed on his rich source.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 8|
--------------------------------------------
Chris continued, oblivious for the moment to her arousal, though it wouldn't be long until his dragon senses picked up on it.

"You stood by me, accepted me through all my dragon stuff. Heck, there's all sorts of shit going on with me and these crazy abilities, Susan. But, I want to be with you, I miss you ... I miss fucking you."

"I know honey, I feel the same!" Susan looked up, stopping his reply with a gentle kiss. "Just take me away somewhere warm. Things might get a bit weird, but I need you. I just need a real manhandling right now, okay?"

So he did, he held her tightly and began focusing on their destination. They vanished, jaunting for a few seconds through the Ether and out onto a brightly moonlit beach almost halfway around the globe. Susan looked around in confusion as the jolted back into existence.

"Just someplace I've been checking out for Hailey," he explained.

Surf rolled gently in on one side, whilst towering dunes of desert sand merged seamlessly in from the other, meeting as a featureless beach. It was the starkest environment Susan had ever witnessed. By moonlight, it was simple and eerily beautiful. It made her imagine them on an alien planet, where nothing and no one could interrupt their carnal reunion. A real part of her had been dreading that they wouldn't return to this, Susan realised. It was a huge relief, and her entire body warmed, humming and moistening for him.

"It's perfect." She leaned up for another kiss, this one full of passionate, gentle tongue-duelling.

Warm night breezes gusted in off the Eastern Atlantic, full of humidity and salty promise. It kissed the entwined lovers too as they began a time-honoured scramble to remove each other's clothes. With only wind, desert, and sea as witness, Chris took them down to the sand, her butt perched right in the middle of all their discarded garments.

Susan held back the sueth-azoah's eager curiosity as Chris kissed his way down her heaving sternum. Her insides shivered in anticipation, engorging and flooding like a springtime river. She was losing focus as every skilful, teasing touch titillated her racing mind to greater heights of lust and affection. Her body was hot and flushed with a physical need to once again feel his lovely cock moving within her.

Chris spread her legs firmly, and Susan opened her eyes, gasping in delight. He was so damn strong, and he was taking what he wanted. She had to warn him.

"Honey, these things are going to come out, I can't...."

Looking up her body, past heaving breasts and soft, sexy tummy, Chris grinned evilly at the thought of her crying out for him.

"It's okay," he squeezed the back of her knees. His chin pressed just above her pubic mound, the warm, full forest of her sex tickling him. "I trust you."

"Oooooo ... yesssss," she shivered despite the warm air as he kissed his way into her bush, past throbbing clitoris, latching his mouth right over the meat of her puffy, needy hole. His devilsome tongue slipped within her, warm and curious. Soon the witch was writhing against his restraining hands, clutching at the cooling sand under her fingers in one hand and balling her fist in his hair with the other.

Her orgasm arrived almost too quickly, a shuddering, toe-curling half-minute of delight when he finally switched focus to her little pink bean, washing it relentlessly with flattened tongue-strokes.

Around them, dark shapes moved like vipers beneath the sand, emanating outward from beneath the keening witch. Some of the slithering roots bulged up to the surface, dark nodules of new growth exposed to the night air. Neither of them noticed the expanding bed of black tendrils and reaching, feathery fronds they now lay amongst.

It wasn't until Chris moved up to mount her that they gave him pause. By way of explanation, Susan shrugged sheepishly beneath him, full breasts jiggling with nipples at firm attention. It was an expression he found irresistibly cute.

Slowly, his sandy hand brushed across her ribcage. He reached further, underneath the sides of her boobs to feel what was going on out of sight. The things emerged seamlessly up and down her spine and sank into the earth. His fingertips touched the dark, tough plant-flesh anchoring her torso to the beach. Their cold, alien texture set his subconscious clamouring to pull his hand away. The tendrils shivered in response, rising up out of the earth to point and sway like an enraptured congregation.

His cock throbbed mightily on Susan's stomach as he loomed over her, spitting precum from the massive tip.

Dragon and sueth-azoah sized each other up and down. The sueth-azoah's strange, slow thoughts bubbled to the surface within Susan, aroused to wakefulness by her passion, excitement, and the warm currents of his overflowing potential.

"It's very curious about you," Susan breathed, watching him tentatively explore as she regained her wind. It was fascinating and all, she hadn't seen this out of the sueth-azoah before, but she really needed them back on track. "But if we could put that aside for a moment, darling, I goddamn need you in me!"

That got his attention alright. His beautiful member felt so hard and angry in her fingers, pulsing and ready to buck its way free of her guidance. Susan took him firmly in hand, pushing him all the way back so he nuzzled up against her weeping, reddened slit. She carefully rubbed him up and down, teasing her clitoris, getting him all slick and sloppy amidst her flushed-up labia and soft curls. It had been weeks, and his enchantment had been burned away, but she just knew her body was eager to welcome back the thick cock, and the man she had fallen in love with.

They pressed together as one, sensing the perfect moment as his fat helmet-head lodged just right, catching between her inner lips. Her body resisted for a moment, struggling to accommodate his girth before she fully relaxed. Then, with a gentle, measured thrust, he was sinking sinfully into her silken, slippery sanctuary. Dragon and witch both sighed in mutual pleasure and warmth. Their eyes met, and relieved grins flashed white in the moonlight, they were reunited delightfully.

Susan came again as they worked their bodies together, he was so huge and hard that all her best spots rubbed fiendishly on his spongy ridge. Her clit even touched the glistening length of him as he slowly stroked her with barely more than a few inches. They were both trying to look down between their bodies in the dim light as she shook, a creamy little gurgle of fluid pleasure oozing around their tight, swollen coupling. Their foreheads bumped together as they jostled, and they both ended up laughing at each other, grinning like mad now as they kissed and got their rhythm back on track.

He had missed this, the silly, passionate moments with her. As their eyes met in the Saharan night, he knew she felt exactly the same.

"Gods," Susan huffed, wiping the first beads of sex-sweat off her neck with a shaking, slightly sandy hand. "I probably shouldn't be saying this but, honey, I adore your penis."

"Thanks," Chris grinned, pulling his hands to her soft hips, adjusting her for what came next. "Care for some more?"

"Yeah, and don't hold back," she crooned as he pulled her legs up and kissed her taut calves, laying them on his shoulders. "That's it, baby, squeeze my hips, I love it! Let go of your magic, I need a big one."

Chris sank further into her gooey honeypot with a slick, squelching push, growling all the while in pure male ecstasy. He was only too happy to let go of the concealing hold on his energy, wrap her into a Susan-pretzel, and focus entirely on enjoying her lush pussy. He proceeded to do just that, fucking her with long, powerful strokes, slowly inching deeper and deeper.

She was just as responsive, just as creamy, and just the perfect mix of tight and easy wrapped around his throbbing cock. In the excitement of their joining, he was never going to last, despite Lillian's best efforts to tire him out that afternoon.

"Oh fuck, honey, I missed you!" Susan wailed when his deepening thrusts eventually touched bottom. "Chriiiiissss! Ooohoo ... aaaahh!"

He held himself there, massive and twitching, gently rocking back and forth in her silky embrace. Chris took great pawing handfuls of her bum and thighs in his ardour, squeezing, trying desperately not to explode then and there in her tight, molten womanhood. They were both sweating now, genitals all gooey, a glistening, hair-streaked mess as he hunched over her again and again.

The sueth-azoah reached out, the otherworld sensation of its touch running up his arm, another curling loosely around his ankle.

"Sorry," Susan tried to bat away the curious appendages to no avail.

"Don't worry, I fucking love us together like this," Chris withdrew his meaty cock to the tip, admiring her beauty laid out just for him in the nighttime peacefulness. She was the same lovely woman as before, their sex proved it. So he could handle an inquisitive magical creeper or two if that's what it took to be with her. She accepted his wings and scales, and strangely enough, his dragon's distrust for the sueth-azoah seemed a lot less pressing with his cock buried almost to the hilt in his trilling mate. Funny that.

"Mhhh, then more, more! Please!" She encouraged with wide, lustful eyes and a loving, happy smile. That orgasm had been delightful, and she was due at least another before he found a home for one of his massive loads.

Spurred by her words and his own excitement, Chris lunged his cock right back into her velvety core, drawing out an adorable yelp of surprise as they began to fuck once more. They soon established their old pace, firm, deep thrusts with both of them rocking together just so. There was a little stirring, hip-twist-thing he sometimes did at the end of his stroke which never failed to make Susan yowl, and yowl she did.

Around them, more and more dark shapes writhed out of Susan and across the sand. Delicate fern-fronds sprouted upward, eagerly sensing the draw of huge tides of magic as the rutting dragon edged closer and closer to release. By the time he finally exploded, grunting and shuddering as huge streamers of thick semen splashed violently in Susan's box, the reunited lovers were entirely surrounded by a cage of twisting, woody growth.

Small, dark threads grew silently out from Susan's skin, all along her spread thighs and the inside of her arms. More sprouted anywhere they touched. The witch was barely aware of them reaching, gripping him with feather-light touches. Both of them were too busy trying to kiss and grunt incoherently at each other.

When Susan finally realised what the sueth-azoah had planned, it was too late. She cried out mid-climax as the thing somehow found its own wellspring of release, plunging headlong into all of that vital, wonderful magic spewing into her.

Amid his throbbing, the vine's previously exploratory touches suddenly firmed, tenacious as ivy. At first, Chris didn't care, too focused holding his lover tight as her body danced and writhed to every fantastically pleasurable pulse of seed rising up his cock. But the ancient plant had finally found the tantalising source of power it had sensed, and it wasn't about to let go until it had its fill.

"Just hold still, baby," Susan almost panicked, trying to somehow calm him before he had a chance to struggle. "Oh shit, I need ... I need ... ahhhhhieeee!"

"Fuck!" Chris shouted as her hips went into overdrive, rolling hard into his still-spasming cock. He couldn't move, something was squeezing around his balls, holding his cock firmly in place. The greedy handfuls he'd taken of her plump bottom were stuck there as if by superglue. He even felt something slither around the thick root of his raging-hard penis, tightening right where they pressed together. All this in the midst of his orgasmic stupor, when abruptly a different, chilling sensation demanded his full attention.

Something moved against the tip of his penis, then suddenly her vagina exploded into a hot, wriggling, alien nest. Chris cried out in wordless alarm. When he tried to wrench away, her ass just came with him, dragging across their clothes-pile and into the sand. His shoulders hit the fern-frond bars of their wooden sex-prison. Their throbbing loins were just as locked together.

Chris gawped up at the strange structure in confused revulsion, sensing his orgasmic overflow of magic ricocheting around inside the barrier of dark, fractal growths and rustling leaves. He was trapped all right.

Susan was delirious, her body overloaded with magic, as she and the sueth-azoah drank him down by the thick-tap root locked so pleasurably deep within her.

"I don't know ... I need this. Just hold still, I'm sorry!"

Chris groaned his assent, his long orgasm was almost over, and he felt tenderised and helpless in her squeezing coils. This wasn't so bad, he thought. Weird for sure, but he loved being with Susan again, and if she needed this, he would just lean back and enjoy himself.

All his movements stopped with a disbelieving grunt as the slithering sensation within her found his piss-slit and somehow cork-screwed its way back up his cum-filled shaft.

"Ghhaaaa!" he looked right into her eyes as it happened.

Chris' torso heaved, thrusting involuntarily as his climax redoubled. Something detonated inside him, a tidal wave of uncontrolled energy rushing out in every direction to slam against the sueth-azoah's widespread leaves. A solid river of cum gushed out of him, the thing somehow unleashing the floodgates from within him. It was so good that it hurt. His cock throbbed so hard he could have sworn it was about to pop.

He definitely hadn't signed up for this, but Chris suddenly felt woozy, dreadfully tired even as he hunched out weakening, automatic thrusts against her upturned bottom.

"So good, honey. You're so damn, good for me," Susan breathed in his sweaty, manly scent, holding him close in every way. He was still groaning and trying to hump her into the sand, even as he was tapped for every last drop of precious seed he contained. Her body was absolutely stuffed with energy, the hungry sueth-azoah satisfied now beyond any previous measure or memory. She received a strangely fearful sense from it, as if its leaves were being wilted by a sun too hot. The vines and tendrils began slowly retreating back across the sand and beneath her skin, quiescent and satisfied.

Entirely spent, Chris collapsed into Susan's arms and the embrace of her numerous new limbs. By some male instinct honed over millennia, he turned his face into her rosy breast and promptly fell asleep.

They were left sweaty, sandy, and naked at the edge of the great desert, Chris already snoring gently against her tit. Susan lapsed into a perfect state of dreamy sex-lethargy, the rolling sea-breeze slowly drying them with warm gusts. She could probably go for a couple of years after a dose of power like that, but she wouldn't have to. His cock was still mostly inside, right where it belonged, his excess seed made the beach stick tenaciously to her butt. He was back in her arms, and Susan wasn't going to let anything get between them ever again.

"I love you, my sweet, sweet man."

***

The jubilant mood in the apartment was only momentarily dampened when Susan and Chris stumbled out of the Ether. Claire and Annabel fussed over his sandy, exhausted, almost drunken state before bustling him off to be made presentable.

Susan had messaged ahead, explaining why they would be arriving late, and now Lillian arched a teasing eyebrow in her direction as Chris was led away.

"What?" Susan asked, feeling almost self conscious as Petra and the vampiress closed in. Michelle and Hailey were watching from the sidelines in modest amusement, their conversation interrupted by the dramatic entrance. "I didn't mess up someone's turn with him or anything, did I?"

"My dear, no. Not at all," Lillian's famous lips arched, then she burst into a huge grin. "I just wanted to say congratulations, and welcome back to the club."

"Oh, I ... thank you, Lillian." Susan bobbed her head, embarrassed but feeling warm fuzzies all the same.

"It does terrible things to my ego to ask, but what did you do to him?" Lillian glanced into the open doorway of the bedroom where Chris could be heard putting up grouchy resistance to various wardrobe selections. "I thought what I did to him this afternoon would be hard to upstage, but you've blown me out of the water."

"Well, we ... um, you know...," Susan trailed off and began scowling at the vampire. "Damnit Lillian!"

"He does look a bit like a wrung out washcloth," Petra giggled. "Go grab a shower, Susan, you can tell us all about it later. The girls are a little hyper to see the house, and I'll admit, I am too! You'd better be quick."

With a start, Susan realised that the rest of the brood was smartly dressed and made-up for the occasion. Meanwhile, she was a sandy sex-mess and their brief dip in the ocean before their return hadn't done much about it. It felt wonderful, and a back-straightening shiver ran up her spine just thinking about it.

The van-ride from the hotel came courtesy of Reyla's security team, and Lillian promised that they wouldn't mind at all. Chris was in no state to be teleporting around with large groups, and he recognised that. In fact, the drive over was surprisingly nice. Just relaxing in the back between Petra and Lillian, listening to the excited babble of speculation and anticipation, it was perfect.

When they turned off onto the gravel track leading around the back of their lot, Annabel and Claire led a rowdy cheer from the front of the vehicle. Petra, joined in beside him, which startled Chris. Then Lillian gave his arm a squeeze and added her huskier voice to the tumult. Tired though he was, a huge smile lit his face. There was no choice but to be infected by their cheer, not after all the time and effort, and not with the swelling sense of accomplishment he felt in his chest.

Stephen's pickup was parked beside a messy stack of half-broken timber and packing-wrap when they all piled out of their ride. Chris understood immediately that it meant, but chuckled to hear Annabel speculate rather inexpertly to Immi about what it might have once contained. He gave a guilty glance around at the uninspiring, gravel-strewn yard and mostly empty warehouse floor. There was still room for improvement and a lot of beautification. At least the light bursting up out of the open stairwell did look rather dramatic as it spewed across the old, cobwebbed beams above.

As the bemused werewolf who'd driven them over received thanks and pulled away, Chris realised that everyone was staring at him expectantly.

"What?" he goofed.

"Well, aren't you going to say anything?!" Annabel squealed, almost jumping up and down on the cold, crunchy footing.

He was suddenly at a loss for words, overwhelmed by the moment, by so much expectation and enthusiasm. The property and the house had become commonplace to him long ago. It was all completely new for most of the brood, though he had suspicions that a couple of information leaks had spread in secret amongst his ladies.

"Okay, let me think. Hmm, how about this ... I built us a house. It's cold, so let's go inside?" he tried, gesturing over his shoulder at the beckoning light.

His response seemed to exacerbate the excitable members of his brood, whilst amusing the more sedate and level headed. In short order, he was being lovingly frog-marched forward by Claire and Annabel, Hailey and Immi acting as lieutenants at their sides.

"Oh, to be that young again," Petra remarked fondly as she, Lillian, Susan, and Michelle formed a rear guard and followed along.

"It is quite exciting," Susan admitted as Chris warned about the lack of handrails right at the start of the stairs. Apparently that was a job for after the furniture arrived. "I feel like I probably know the least about what to expect."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 9|
--------------------------------------------
Immi paused just before her first downward step, scanning a final critical eye over what she'd seen so far and pronouncing her judgement to everyone.

"It'd better be good down there!"

Petra chortled.

"Oh, I know I'm terrible," the dragoness admitted to the others. "It's just, I was thinking the same thing a moment ago. A dirty old warehouse doesn't exactly make a stunning impression, even if you know it's not the main attraction."

A champagne cork came flying up at them with a loud plonk when they finally got to the bottom landing. A great big bellow of werebison laughter followed, and Janet Sibon was scolding her husband before the cork had even come to rest. Stephen had to fend off his daughter, too, as the groups merged into a bustle of greetings and smiles.

Janet had a tray of glass flutes from her own home standing ready as the libations were poured. Very thoughtfully, she also had a non alcoholic bubbly option available for those who were reproductively indisposed.

As the drinks passed around, Chris realised he wasn't going to get out of saying at least something to mark the occasion. He cleared his voice, and was gratified as the boxy little room at the bottom of the stairs quieted.

"Here's to friends, home, and family," Chris started somberly, whatever train of exhausted inspiration he seemed to be riding must be working, so he rolled with it. He raised his glass, meeting all the eyes that glanced back and forth as they drank to the toast. Then he looked right at Stephen, who had made all of this possible, and nearly choked up on a manly surge of emotion. "And here's to friends who help you build homes, and become family."

"I'll drink to that!" Hailey sequealed, right before downing her entire glass like a seasoned socialite, shocking everyone into a murmur of laughter and twitters.

"Cheers!" Stephen joined in, and conversation sparked up again as he was suddenly bombarded with hugs, thanks, and eager questions.

Michelle slipped her arm through Chris' as Petra moved off to join in the growing spectacle surrounding the vault-style door and Stephen's proud recitation of it's heft and sturdiness.

"That was ... nice," Michelle looked up at him with the sincerest dark eyes as she spoke. "Good work."

Chris was about to defer that Stephen and the goblins did just about everything when Annabel and Claire began hollering for everyone to come look. The eager girls had snuck ahead of the main party, of course, and were now confronted with three patiently-waiting goblins and their latest masterpiece.

"Thanks, Michelle." He squeezed her close against his side, sharing a moment of heartfelt affection. Lillian's warmth pressed in from his right, causing his self-protective instincts to fire as he realised he might be in for trouble. Glancing first at the sly quirk at the corner of Michelle's lips, then to Lillian's best cheshire, he realised it might not be the sort of trouble he anticipated, but it was definitely trouble. "Uh, oh."

More of the brood began streaming down the length of the airlock-like corridor leading further underground to the house proper.

"We made up," Lillian said, casually brushing aside the last three days of bad blood as if they were of no consequence at all. She took his hand and laced their fingers. "We formed an alliance."

"More of a political bloc, really," Michelle corrected on his left.

"Clever," Lillian chuckled. "I like that."

"Give me strength," Chris glanced theatrically to the rock over their heads. In his bone-weary state, he was only half joking.

"Come on everyone, you don't want to miss this!" Stephen's deep voice interrupted any more chances for Michelle and Lillian to further their cause. He beckoned to the stragglers from the chunky, multi-deadbolt doorway.

Chris knew exactly what the commotion was all about up ahead, and it was true he didn't want to miss his brood's reaction. Whatever no doubt frisky scheme the two had come up with would have to wait. With an exasperated, over-sexed growl, the dragon's strong hands trailed downward along their sides to posessively stroke two very different, but equally meritorious, cloth-covered rumps.

"You heard the man," he squeezed very firmly, the sort of hold he planned on using to ravish the sexy troublemakers at his earliest rested convenience. He couldn't believe he'd been walking on eggshells around them for days, and now this?

Michelle jumped a little, gasping sexily at his roughness. The voluptuous vampiress merely batted sultry, tempting eyelashes his way. Sexy retribution would really have to wait. Whatever Susan and that crazy plant had done to him, there was precious little left in the tanks, magically or otherwise. His entire groin still throbbed. Ghosts of every strange sensation she'd made him feel seemed to jangle up and down his nerves every few minutes.

Chris released their cute butts with a sharp little push toward the door. He brought up the rear of the party as Michelle and Lillian scampered out of range, expecting swatts to follow. They were snickering triumphantly as they brushed by Stehpen, clinking flutes.

"How do you do it?" Stephen asked the young dragon almost piteously, he'd caught most of the interaction. "You know, I think I'd go crazy."

"I might yet, Stephen, I might yet."

The room at the end of the security corridor had always been a bit nebulous in Chris' visions for the house. It was the first real room they'd cut out of the Denver sub-soil, and Chris had sort of imagined it as someplace to store thick coats and dirty shoes, a mud-room. However, given the room's relative unimportance in the overall project, not to mention its heavy traffic flow, work on finishing the simple cube-cut rectangle was one of the last things they got around to.

Uninspired by plans for 'yet another boring human room,' Yurt, Belthelas, and Gruff had taken it upon themselves to make a reception hall worthy of a dragon's lair. They delivered yet again, once more astounding Chris with the quality of their craftsmanship.

Down the long corridor, over the heads of his astounded brood, Chris caught a peak at the spectacular artistic combination of lighting and sculpture that would greet anyone entering their home.

The goblins chose to leave the stone walls bare, gouging huge chunks out of the far wall and all along the left side to create their main piece. They'd just started cutting away at the walls and ceiling one evening when Chris was headed home. The next day, the room seemed twice as large, and was dominated by an almost-life-size version of himself as dragon. The sculpture was frozen in a dramatic pose, twisting around to roar open-mawed right at the portal where you walked in. It looked badass, a Bond-villain would have been jealous. Though the stone dragon was slightly blocky, even cartoonish, the lighting just brought it to life.

The room was incredibly dark overall, full of deep shadows and unexpected shapes. It created a striking contrast after the tunnel's harsh LEDs. Most of the light came flickering in red and orange tones from a tiny magical campfire at the far end of the room. The dragon's body trailed in and out through dancing, firelight shadows along the left wall, fading a little dark, then darker back toward the entrance. It gave the impression that you'd just startled the beast deep in his cave, and were about to be incinerated over its shoulder.

The dragon's head and part of its sinuous neck actually reared back out of the far wall, a separate bust that hung menacingly overhead. This extra dimension tricked the mind for another look, just to make sure the thing wasn't real. Stuttering flame-light on rough hewn brown scales complimented this realistic outcome perfectly.

The goblins even chipped away at every smooth surface other than the floor, completing the cave-like atmosphere with a few fake stalactites for good measure.

"Janet almost peed herself when I brought her down." Stephen nudged Chris as they stood at the back, watching the goblins proudly lead the procession up toward the dragon's head.

"Oh, I did not, Stephen!" Janet swiped playfully at her husband's forearm in retribution and took a sip of champagne. "I just got a bit of a surprise is all, it's...."

"Striking?" Chris hoped.

Belthelas was explaining that the dragon's spines along its back and tail could be used to hang coats. There was a dimmer switch for the tiny, glow-worm-imitating lights up in the ceiling, and shoes went up against the dragon's huge ... bulging ... gut.

Chris' eyes narrowed and he scowled suspiciously at the terrible trio. They were playing it breezy, but he would have sworn his tummy was never like that when he'd posed for them as a dragon. The sculpture's rear haunches looked suspiciously ample, too. Annabel was already patting the great big tummy and laughing with Immi and Claire as the sprite petted the redhead's little pregnancy bulge in return. They hadn't, had they? It was definitely his dragon-form though, not either of his mates'.

"I'd go with intimidating," Hailey's mom considered, taking her husband's hand. She could tell he was happy as a hog right now, he secretly loved to bask in praise for his work, though the silly man would never admit to such a thing.

Gruff was impressing Michelle and Lillian with his explanation of the two ambush positions hidden in the dark recesses behind the stone dragon.

"I like it," Stephen added his support for the goblin's work. "Leaves no doubt who you're dealing with when you come inside."

Belthelas snapped his fingers theatrically and a little gouts of flame shot out of the sculptures' two nostrils. They petered out harmlessly after about a foot, but the sudden flash was enough to get Hailey and Annabel squealing.

"I think those little shits might have gender-bended me," Chris realised, walking around to get a better look at the discrepancy he'd noticed in the bright flash. "Yep, look at the corner of the eyes. Those are girl-dragon eyes ... Yurt! God-dammit, man, is this your doing?"

Stephen cocked his head, reassessing his outlook on the rock dragon.

"Huh, I guess the front legs do look a little ... dainty? I never noticed before."

"Dainty?!" Chris guffawed, pointing toward the rear of the sculpture. "Look at my big, sexy dragon ass. Yurt!"

"Leave the poor goblin alone," Petra cackled over her shoulder as she straightened from whispering with the diminutive culprit. "I think you make a purty girl-dragon."

That got a laugh from just about everyone, and Chris eventually bowed and joined in as the goblin brothers began pulling taunting faces at him amidst the safety of his adoring brood. It seemed like the girls were in on the joke. Immi grabbed Yurt around the waist and began leading the surprised goblin in an impromptu waltz around the room, an absurd level of showboating. Chris shook his head in defeat, too tired and now too amused for more than passing irritation.

His dragon grumbled something petty about changing his stance on goblin-snacks, but he would always remember the little punks fondly when their ways parted. This last zinger would be a permanent reminder of their days spent together in sweaty comradery and playful antagonism, he didn't begrudge them that.

Anticipation grew when everyone slowly gathered by the sculpture's head, waiting for Chris to pull aside the big sliding door. Staircases and imposing entrance ways were all well and good, but this was obviously the big reveal and the brood knew it.

Immi was pouting at his side, tipsy and resentful that Annabel had confiscated the mostly untouched glass of bubbles she had so thoughtfully liberated from Hailey. The two extra she'd successfully swiped from the tray of poured drinks had been deliciously tingly on the way down.

"Okay, here we go," Chris breathed, as he reached for the handle on the hanging slab of oak and tugged. For a moment, all his crazy worries and doubts from earlier that day came rushing back. Then the wholesome enchantment he read on their faces incinerated his fears as they got their first glimpses of their new home.

The cunningly designed space of the main living area lay revealed. The large room seemed cavernous devoid of decoration, bare floorboards stretching off down the house, unbroken by rug or furniture.

Annabel was first through, starting forward confidently at the head of the jostling pack. She trailed to a halt as she caught sight of the kitchen to her right. She barely got out two more words before her throat got all clogged up with emotion.

"Oh ... wow."

Chris was ready, wrapping his arms around her as the others streamed around them.

Petra brushed by with light reaffirming touches for her mate and his First as they embraced.

"Y ... you got me my dream sto...," Annabel hiccoughed, brushing silly, happy tears from the corner of her eyes. She couldn't believe he'd remembered that ancient conversation. "Sorry, it's the craziest thing to start bawling about. You got my dream stovetop?"

"Of course, Dee."

They hugged, twisting slowly side to side as everyone spread out and began poking around the kitchen and laundry. Hailey made a beeline to check the progress of the study, the only room so far planned for the left side of the huge central room.

"It's just, just," Annabel was struggling to relay her tumultuous thoughts. Everywhere she looked her eyes snagged on fresh detail. She loved the lightness of freshly-painted plaster, contrasting tastefully with strategic use of bare stone and wooden accents. It seemed strange that there were no windows or curtains, but the more she looked, the more she realised that great lengths had been taken to limit any sensations of claustrophobia.

"Oh my God, this is a porno bathroom!" Michelle's voice rang out into the living room, followed by a peal of Susan's laughter as the witch caught sight of gold-gilded tiles and a line of dragon-headed shower nozzles.

Annabel looked up at him questioningly, a cheeky smile forming on her lips.

"It sort of is," Chris shrugged, slightly embarrassed that he hadn't constrained the goblins on that one. "Go on, go and enjoy it with them."

"Hello? We're living one big porno?!" Annabel shouted back defiantly, detaching herself from him with a coltish, excited hop. She regained a more dignified candour a step or two later, piercing his heart with a giddy glance back over her shoulder.

After a good five minutes of experimental tap-turning and jaunty speculation about the possibility of such a huge tub, Stephen took over and guided Annabel into a grand tour of her new kingdom.

No feature or design decision was left unexplained. Chris watched fondly as Annabel swamped Stephen in praise and expressions of delight at each attraction. In the end, the big werebison earned himself a heartfelt hug and a lingering kiss on his cheek. He was positively beaming. As predicted, she wholeheartedly agreed with his last minute decision to put in a more industrial refrigerated room.

Michelle, Petra, and Claire were flicking eagerly through some interior design catalogues that Stephen had thoughtfully left out on the kitchen bar. Lillian saw this and dropped a huge bombshell on them all when she announced that the Vampire Council had just yesterday finalised a twenty-eight percent tithe on the vampiress Lakshmi's assets for her role in the debacle involving House Lefayd. Most of that considerable sum was to be rewarded to Lillian, launching her firmly into whatever lofty stratum lay above that of filthy-rich. In celebration, the girls could pick whatever furnishings they wanted for the house and their own rooms, she would be picking up the bill.

The idea that Lillian was so wealthy somehow bothered Chris. It was weird because he wasn't sure if he'd ever seen her buy something. The vampire certainly never flaunted it. She treated the whole event with such nonchalance that he had to wonder how far out of touch she was with the rest of society, human society that is. He couldn't help wondering if he would fall into the same trap, five hundred years was a long time to be alive.

Chris was almost dead on his feet by that point, and what he really needed was a good Ether-nap to recharge his batteries.

Most of the brood had piled in to check out the 'harem's spa', or were venturing further afield to claim bedrooms. Left to his own devices, Chris tottered over to the corner of the dining room. By the entrance to the recently added study was a big pile of all the drop-cloth and old sheets the goblins had folded away for the showing. He collapsed on them, his entire body sighing sweet relief. He just lay there listening to all the happy bustle, a goofy contented smile plastered on his lips.

Susan snuggled up with him a few minutes later, quietly whispering all sorts of loving devotion, none of which he was up for right now.

"There's nothing left of me, devil-woman," Chris yawned as she nuzzled close. "What happened back there anyway?"

"I'm sorry, sugar. I think you really rocked the sueth-azoah's world. You certainly got mine shaking, though it did get a little strange at the end there."

"A little?" Chris summoned the effort to raise his head off their impromptu bedding for a moment, eyebrows cocked at her in disbelief. "You trussed me up like a roast hog, put a thing up my ting-a-ling, and just about sucked down every last ounce of magic I had. That was freaky as shit."

Susan stroked her hand across the fabric of his black dress-shirt, considering her answer.

"I'm not entirely sure, honey. I sort of stopped holding back during that one orgasm, and then all that stuff happened. I was so happy to be with you, it all felt so good and I just ... let go. Everything got carried away after that, and damned if I didn't cum my little heart out."

"Yes you fucking did," he growled, rolling onto his side so his hand could patrol her curving rear posessively.

"So ... we'll do it again?" she asked, feeling tremulous, yet elated inside. She suspected she knew the answer, and her heart told her that she did, but hearing the words from his own lips would do her wonders.

"Haven't killed me yet," he grinned back. "Though I might have to beg for a few days' respite."

Susan leaned up and kissed him tenderly.

"This house is so amazing, Chris. Thank you. I don't know what I was imagining when you talked to me about it, but this is much better. The bedrooms are huge, Annabel is in love with the kitchen, and that bathroom is just ridiculous."

"Good, ridiculous?" He squeezed her hips against his own.

"We'll see."

They stilled as footsteps approached, heels tapping elegantly across the wooden floor. Hailey and her mom were in a bit of an emotional pow-wow over at the kitchen, coming to terms with the fact that Hailey really was about to leave the nest.

"What are you two lovebirds up to," Petra smiled down at Chris and Susan fondly.

"Just stealing a few cuddles," Susan said, feeling more like her old, carefree self with every affirmation of his affection.

"Well, I'm pleased to see you're back in the saddle. Sorry to interrupt, but a little goblin told me that there's a special dragons-only gift awaiting my pleasure if I can find someone called, 'that ruddy-big wingnut'. Who do you think that might be?"

"That's me," Chris rumbled. "And it's for you and Claire, though not strictly dragons-only."

"Well, come on!" Petra hauled him to his feet, unable to bear the anticipation. Her young mate had surpassed all expectations again with this home. Her dragon felt instinctively comforted in such a lavish burrow, traces of her mate's spicy scent already lingering in every room. If she wasn't so excited to find out about this mysterious gift, she would probably be trying to jump his worn out bones right there in the paint-speckled rags. "I can't wait another moment. Sorry, Susan."

--------------------------------------------
The witch climbed to her feet and followed the dragons toward the strange room with the buried geode. Now there was something truly impressive, the magical storage device had caught the slow attention of her chlorophyllic companion too.

The door to the master bedroom had naturally attracted scrutiny from the ladies during their familiarisation. It was the only handle that wouldn't open, so when Petra dragged Chris before the three waiting goblins to unlock the door, everyone crowded around curiously.

Belthelas started with a little formal expression of his Queen's admiration, and gave a little bow before taking each dragoness by the hand to lead them into the bedroom. Chris held the door as Yurt and Gruff followed behind, but signalled a restraining gesture to the rest of his brood.

"Just give us a few minutes," Chris smiled tiredy at Annabel's mild affront to being barred from her own room. "Sorry, things are a bit cramped, and I think there's an enchantment you all need to be introduced to for safety's sake. There will be lots of chances to see it afterward."

His explanation only served to stoke their curiosity but he slipped inside and shut the door behind himself. As he came inside, Petra tentatively held a hand toward the silvery mythril curtain, shying away as it reached out to her in turn.

Chris got to watch Belthelas transfer magical ownership of the complicated enchantment. The goblin stroked loose a fistful of slippery metallic strands away from the main body, drawing Petra's hand into the mix so they both touched it skin to skin. Next thing, all three of the trio whipped out their stubby wands and began madly tapping away on the entwined dragons carved into the stone of the narrow, ornate partal.

For a heartbeat, Chris dreaded that this was supposed to be some sort of drumbeat, and they were about to break into a rendition of their favourite gorey songs. Thankfully his nightmare wasn't brought to fruition, he didn't know if he could have handled that.

Claire was bouncing up on the balls of her feet beside her mom when he moved closer and put his hands on her shoulders.

"This is so neat!"

"Yeah, this stuff has given me a few cool ideas to think about," Chris murmured back as the goblins drew their seemingly random stick-rattling to a close with a solemn little chant.

"Now the metal-spirit will obey only you and yours, lady dragon," Belthelas spoke formally as the archway of tiny chains parted before her to reveal the stooped passage leading deeper. "Please proceed, your grotto awaits."

There wasn't a single curse word in two whole goblin sentences, a remarkable achievement on its own.

"My grotto?" Petra blinked in confusion.

"Your nest," Chris gestured expansively for Petra and Claire to go ahead down the short tunnel. "Apparently it was a dragon thing way back in the day."

Petra seemed to hesitate, blushing a little at the mention of those particular dragon instincts. Claire was less reserved and darted forward, catching her mother's wrist and dragging her along.

Chris listened with bated breath, there were a few muffled giggles, then silence. A tiny squeal echoed out of the grotto, followed by a bit of shuffling. He could just picture Claire clapping her hands together under her chin as she took in the beautiful mural on the igloo-shaped dome walls.

"Shit, I forgot to clean up in there this morning," Chris realised, thinking of his miniaturised diamond farm. "Come on lads, let's go see how they like it. One of you is almost guaranteed to get a big'ole facefull of dragon boob."

Someone must have lit the grotto's tiny fire box, because the tunnel was warm. It was near the hotter limits of cozy for Chris, but he knew both his dragonesses loved the heat, Claire especially.

It turned out to be Petra who was entranced by the idyllic nature scenes painted so skillfully on the curved wall. Claire was crouched down in the centre of the room, carefully prodding his pile of mini-diamonds. The array of dark points was poised motionlessly above, right where he'd left them. Chris leaned down beside his curious auburn-haired lover to explain.

"A silly little project of mine, I like to call them sand-diamonds. Here, let me get these out of the way." With a tilt of his head, the junior-sized Ether spheres lifted off up to the top of the grotto like some tiny UFO invasion formation blasting off in retreat. "These are safe, but you probably shouldn't touch any of my weird stuff you find lying around. In fact, let's make that a family rule from now on."

"Okay, good point. I wish I understood more about your magic, it's so strange that you bend reality from inside the Ether. It's incredible," Claire smiled, sinking her entire hand deeper into the warm little pile of precious stone.

"We'll have more time for exploring that sort of stuff now," Chris nodded in agreement. "You should come on an expedition or two with Hailey and I. So, Petra, what do you think?"

"This is amazing," Petra murmured, reaching up to brush her fingers across the vivid autumn leaves of a beach-tree. The majestic stag stood nearby, it was painted so well that her dragon wanted to eat it. "How did we earn this, Chris. What did we do?"

He was at a loss, he hadn't expected that reaction at all. Belthelas saved the day again with his hidden reserves of political savvy. He was really starting to lay it on thick now.

"Queen Glea has always been a staunch supporter of your species," the trio's de facto leader explained. "Hearing of your prosperity and well-being from us will be reward enough, I'm sure. This is a simple token of her friendship."

He got a facefull of dragon-boob.

"That's all well and good but if this is our nest, where do we lounge about, where do we sleep?" Claire asked, looking skeptically at the reed floor-mats around the edges and the big depression of stone where they stood. A sly smile teased the corners of her mischievous lips. "And what are the diamonds for?"

Chris could tell she'd guessed some portion of his designs and was hungry to unravel them, she was in a frisky mood after the evening's anticipation. It was a shame he wasn't up to his usual game.

"Ah, about that.... There are plans, but I need a dragon or two with the stones to help me pull off a teeny bit of illegal mineral extraction."

Claire frowned, she didn't get it.

"You want us to ... mine?"

Beside them Petra spun, rounding on him with predatory knowledge. She dropped the second goblin from her smothering embrace, mischievous green eyes taking on a reptilian slant. Her dragon was doing backflips inside her ribcage, demanding to be let loose upon their mate. A silver front of tiny scales slid up her elegantly cocked neck, across her smooth, strong jaw and flattening nose. She just had the wherewithal to limit herself to their shared form.

Chris got one last glance at Yurt picking himself up and high-fiving Belthelas. Gruff shook his fist at the injustice of missing out. He had to feel for poor Gruff, this evening would probably spawn a goblin legend or two about Petra's pair after tonight. Buttons tore through holes on her form-fitting silky dress shirt, her emerging wings shredding and stretching through the back. Her bra put up more of a struggle against her wing's expansion, and the gilt dragoness vaporised the offending encumbrance with an arc of static electricity directly from the tip of a stunning white claw.

Those perfect, pale, creamy tits jostled free, his gold flashing from the heart of her cleavage. Petra shook out her long, platinum mane with both hands and stretching her wings a little, preening in front of her mate. She stepped out of her heels, tall and proud, brushing tresses over her left shoulder with a sensuousness practiced over centuries. The dragoness stalked forward.

"A nest of gold...," the almost feline creature hissed softly, looked up at him with piercing, vertically slitted eyes. One of her grey-fingered hands slid intimately onto his tummy, the other going to the simple pendant of his gold hanging from a black jewelry line around her neck. She'd been wearing that a lot lately.

Her hand dropped the trinket, snaking gently up around his neck. On tiptoe, Petra's wings rustled as she pulled him into a tender, careful kiss. Marvelous silver teat-peaks brushed his chest, and the dragoness dragged his hand roughly on top of the swell of her womb, their son within.

Chris was surprised to discover that her ardency did tug at something in the shattered remnants of his sex-drive. Petra was already scrabbling at his belt-buckle, and Chris groaned in a strange combination dread and resignation as he saw Claire shepherding the hooting, cheering goblins away down the tunnel.

***

It was with a hefty dose of chagrin that Chris discovered he'd been completely missing the magical point with runes.

Immi only lorded it over him for about the first two hours. In hindsight it seemed obvious, but after a few of Immi's lectures he didn't feel too foolish. However, it was clear that runes were not to be the quick and easy solution to his current undertaking. At least not with him holding the reins of any magical rune-horses.

In essence, they were a written language of magic. He'd been entirely underestimating the part about it being an actual language. In that way, just as in ancient elven-dialect incantations or good old American English, it was a mental system. It was an abstract architecture for storing and conveying ideas.

Chris was essentially the schmuck dumped in a foreign land, armed with only a guide book. The phrases he shouted at passersby might be correct in theory, but his mind wasn't assigning any real meaning to the noises that came from his mouth. Without fluency, he would never understand any reply, any subtlety, joke, or undertext. Nor could he hold a conversation, or grab more than fleeting words from anyone else's.

It made little difference that the language was written, rather than spoken. Immi made the comparison between good runecraft and writing poetry.

Indeed, his rambunctious teacher proudly explained that her own people's ancient tongue provided the basis for some of the runes in broader use today.

The system that got bounced around between the magical races these days was apparently a 'leaky sewage pit'. According to the sprite, crappy tatters of long-lost magical prowess just got cobbled together into something it was easy enough to get the very basics off. However, masters of runecraft almost exclusively stuck to their own racial dialects, hoarding their best discoveries and even taking them to their graves.

In some ancient, nebulous sprite-land, Immi's little ancestors were said to have only spoken in incantation and written only with runes. That ended somewhat cataclysmically according to his latest teacher. Chris thought he could have seen that bad ending a mile off if he'd been around back then.

So, the jumble of mashed-together ideas and sources that Chris had been trying to feed his brain was not helping. Rune phrases were not a mathematical formulae, how could they be? They were abstract. The word 'fire', written in ink on paper was not the real, scorching, crackling thing. Crafting with runes was more an effort in artistry, a lot of which relied on the emotions, hardened mental belief, and subtle intentions of the adept.

Indeed, a lot of what made Immianthe such a potentially potent practitioner was her indoctrination in these ancient languages. The royal princess had no-doubt squirmed and fidgeted her way through decades of formal lessons before her fatefully aborted marriage. Chris pitied whoever had been in charge of making her sit still through that.

For himself, to reach that sort of fluency would probably take years of academic, even cultural immersion. He needed to think, dream, live, and imagine in the magical languages before he would gain any mastery. Once again, the blunt force of his raw power struck a barrier that cared not one little bit for might alone.

That wasn't to say that the last two weeks or so of Immi's involvement hadn't been productive, far from it.

With runes, Chris came to understand, the sort of complex, reactionary system he'd been envisioning in his magical protective wearables were theoretically possible. Immi just said that nobody had bothered with them in all but the oldest living memories. Most Beings who ever had the occasion to use such a thing considered them to be prohibitively expensive overkill. If you had that much magical energy and expertise lying around, your enemies should already be dead several times over.

At that very moment, sitting in the quiet apartment for the last time, Chris contemplated it out. The prototype at the bottom of his work bag was still in its early stages, but it was a working prototype. Tired and content, Immianthe and Chris were sharing one of the big leather recliners in Reyla's soon to be vacant guest suite.

Only hours ago, Immi had been proven one hundred percent right about using one of his scales in the device, it had been critical. Despite the successful test, his dragon was still sulky about dwarves yanking painfully on his tail with blacksmith tongs and chisels.

"You were incredible today," Chris murmured. The sprite cooed something indistinct as his finger traced up and down the exposed skin of her right arm.

They were waiting together. Actually Immi was there to babysit him and Annabel was going to message them when everything was prepared at home. If it didn't happen soon, Chris and Immi were in danger of falling asleep.

Perhaps foolishly, Chris had anticipated an abundance of well-deserved free time after finishing the house. Instead, every moment seemed to get gobbled up faster than one of Immi's magic-cubes.

The days seemed to speed by, and suddenly he was waving goodbye to a place that had come to form a central part of his new life. Reyla's apartments had come to feel a little like home.

Furniture and fittings had been arriving non-stop at the new place, though the flow was thankfully trickling in slower these last few days. He and Susan had done several expeditions back to their old house at Jethry's for nick nacks, appliances, keepsakes, linens, etc, etc.

The old werecat was one of the first to be introduced to 'the lair', as it was starting to become jokingly referred to. Chris didn't think he liked that name very much but it was probably going to stick unless he came up with something better. Only Immi was likely to support him on calling it the 'rampant-sex-basement', which would have been an honest description these days.

Reyla had been invited on a tour, too, and several of her official personnel had found excuses to stop by for this and that over the last fortnight. Magical building inspectors were apparently still a thing too, though these ones seemed to have an almost unhealthy interest in the quantity of energy involved in this construction. Stephen kept them mostly at bay as he finished the last details of his proud creation.

The brood, especially Claire and Petra, had been bustling around on household errands for what seemed like most of their waking moments. He'd done so many trips up and down the staircase with awkward, bulky burdens that he was almost feeling nostalgic for a good old load of crushed stone.

With Annabel pronouncing them officially moved in, the cogs of whatever mischief she'd been quietly organising were put in motion. So, now, after an exhausting day of runic experimentation, he had to await a summons just to be allowed back into his own home. Immi's company was some consolation, but she was in on whatever surprise they were hatching, just as much as Annabel or the rest of them.

It wasn't just his house and prototype armour that had his mind churning.

Hailey had recently been trying to give him lessons in some more advanced math. Their next attempt to magically manage a small fusion reaction would require one of his orbs to self-regulate. Chris needed to polish off his mental calculator if he was about to manifest logarithmic functions into reality.

At Claire's insistence, he'd also spent an afternoon looking down microscopes with Dr. Mayer. It was official, his lymphocytes could somehow attune themselves to work cooperatively with healthy human cells. He still had no idea what to think about being a walking, talking cure all. It was a surprisingly heavy burden to know that he held the solution for infection, even cancer on such a large scale. But there would never be enough of him to fix everyone. It was a responsibility he could do without, in light of everything else.

Michelle hadn't had much time for helping with the move. Her office was busy again after electronic surveillance revealed that a small arms deal they'd been tracking was just the tip of an iceberg. That cell of ex-Familiars was seriously tooling up, planning to supply automatic weapons to all sorts of shady folk up and down the midwest. Magic might be flashy and plenty deadly in a fight, but an assault rifle was still an assault rifle, whomever was holding it.

There was no doubt about it. The tapestry of order in the Being community was fraying. As provisional deadlines for the Revelation drew closer, fractures and lines of stress were becoming increasingly visible.

Diplomatic negotiations were heating as leaders on both sides around the globe had to stop talking in generalisations and start getting down to the nuts, bolts, lives, and cold hard dollars of such a huge international agreement.

Chris was relieved that Susan seemed to be doing a lot better, embracing the tasks of moving and settling in. However, she was now out of the rotation for refilling crystals. While their lovemaking had been much more vanilla than on the edge of the Sahara that night, the sueth-azoah just would not give up energy like that.

They were still struggling to catch up with their backorders, and now it was all down to Claire and Petra. Not that the dragonesses complained, if anything Petra seemed to delight in the legitimate excuse to put on a spectacle and harass him into the bedroom like a slave driver whipping her lazy charges back to work.

Vibration at his side caught Chris' attention, and he had to bounce Immi around a little to get his phone out. The tired sprite muttered adorably but got back to the business of snoozing.

When he saw the caller, Chris was jolted to attention.

"Good evening, Mr. President, how are you?" Chris answered quietly, his voice low in the still, dim room.

"Hello, Chris. I'm well enough."

Chris heard a sigh down the line, a twin of the expression he'd caught himself making just minutes ago. He was about to ask about it when President Falconer continued.

"Look, I'm calling to talk because I wanted to explain things person to person. At least before you read something bland and officious that some underling has written. That would give anyone a bad taste in their mouth after the effort you put in. First, let me applaud you for having Michelle circulate these initiatives to the correct people. However, the consensus is that it's too much, too soon. Right now we're trying to focus on the message that life will go on as normal after the Revelation. Radical changes, for instance, a fast rollout of magical fusion power is not normal. It's scary, it's disruptive, and it places the nation in a position of reliance."

"Damn, that's too bad. I can't really say that I'm surprised I guess."

"I'm sorry, Chris. Maybe a year or two down the track when people have come to terms with living in a more magical world. Then we can work an experimental project or two into the fold, but not yet. Honestly, it's unlikely I'll still be in office by the time you see headway."

"Politics," Chris cursed, exasperated.

"Indeed. I know to someone young this all must seem stupid, and I agree. It's just the way our government works, and it's a fiercely self-protective creature. My advice is to take full advantage of our capitalist culture and pursue your ideas through a business approach. I'm sure you can find a hundred ways to make yourself filthy rich with those remarkable abilities. Then use that capital, both political and fiscal, to start the ball rolling on your more ... ahem ... ambitious projects."

--------------------------------------------
"I sort of expected that to be the answer, sir. At least in the leadup to the Revelation. Well, the ideas are floating around in the open now, and Hailey's not going to stop coming up with new ones any time soon. Does NASA still want me?"

"They certainly do, and that's a good example of how I think you'd be best served to help your cause in the early days. Magic may never be mainstream. For now I suggest you stick to the fringes, and be helpful in non-obtrusive, small ways. Earn a bit of trust before you try to revolutionise our entire energy economy and way of life. Some of those briefs I read have real potential, you've got a very smart young woman on your team, Chris. It's actually quite disheartening that I have to turn you down."

"For now," Chris smiled into the phone. He wasn't about to give up on the vision of global prosperity Hailey had painted him back in that hospital bed months before. Not that easily. "Maybe I'll offer you a job if you don't win a second term."

"That's the spirit!" Robert perked up on the other end of the line, then took on a conspiratorial tone. "Listen, scuttlebut around the Hill is that anyone who's caught trying to exploit the transitional period is likely to get an unpleasant visit in the middle of the night and a hole in the side of their house. Good work, you are causing quite a stir amongst the Untouchables."

"Untouchables?" Chris wondered.

"You know, so rich you can't touch them. Old money, corporate money, the quiet decision makers. That's what I like to call them anyway."

"That's good, perhaps they'll listen to reason. I know there are a few other characters Michelle is watching in case they step out of line."

"Just be careful, Chris. People aren't always rational when backed into a corner, and these are truly powerful people who are accustomed to getting their way. Anyway, keep up the good work. I've got to jet off to this damn fundraiser, if it doesn't go well, I'll keep the job offer in mind. Goodbye, Chris."

"Bye, Robert."

Chris put his phone down on the armchair and looked to his contented little broodmate. She'd been silently listening, attentive and adorably wide-eyed.

"What do you think, Immi, is this whole thing going to hell in a handbasket?"

"Probably, Master," the sprite nodded seriously. "But we'll be okay."

"It's not just us and the girls I'm worried about," Chris admitted. "We've still got to have a world worth living in on the other side of the Revelation. Oh, and if we could sidestep a demonic incursion, that would be great. I can't believe the Synod is still holding back at this stage."

The sprite's unseasonably summery dress had somehow started to bunch-up, a distracting prospect despite the multi-orgasmic afternoon they'd just shared. Let it not be said that his light foray into arcane literacy had been all frustration and no fun. He smoothed the errant garment back into place on her detectably silky thigh, lest she prove too tempting.

"Chris," Immi reached up to brush the tip of his chin, forcing his far-away eyes down to her. "Master, don't pick up these burdens, they're imaginary. Your only true responsibility lies with us. The rest of the world must ultimately make its own way, no matter what you do. Besides, you're on magical probation."

"I'm what?" Chris almost spluttered.

"Well, what would you call it? Narlakis may have sugar coated it, but the Synod has their eye on you. The elf may be a mooney she-spider but it's good advice about lying low for a while. "

"I guess," Chris admitted. It still smarted to think that he was the one being punished for the outcome of schemes set in motion by power hungry elves and criminally-minded merchants. "I hadn't thought about it in terms of probation though."

"Well start. I know you can't help poking your snout into all sorts of places," the little letcher twittered at her own cleverness. "But the last thing we need is for the Synod to find out about your escapades into the dark realm of politics."

"Politics?" Chris distained. "It was just a teeny weeny bit of intimidation, I swear."

Immi cocked her head, giving him a look which conveyed her ample disbelief.

"Well whatever you call it, it's no fair that I missed out on all the fun. Twice! Kat told me that you went to an underground vampire sex-den."

"And having a randy sprite along would have helped me ... how?" Chris chuckled at her antics.

"Hey, I'll have you know that I can be very useful." Immi pushed herself up so she sat closer to eye level. She tried glowering imperiously up at him, determined to get some sort of concession on future mischief. "I can do all sorts of useful stuff. Zapping, blasting, shields, turning people into chickens, turning people into goats, turning people into badgers. That one's not really worth the effort though, an angry badger is more trouble than your average human. And I'm good at runes, of course, and turning people into -"

"I get it, I get it," Chris smiled, putting a finger to her babbling lips. "If I ever need someone turned into something you'll be the first to know about it."

"Good," the sprite harrumphed slyly. "That's the least I deserve after you worked me like that today. My poor tummy might never recover from that third time you unloaded in me."

"Lies," the dragon growled playfully, effortlessly grabbing her so he could whisper against her ear. It was immensely gratifying to hear her breath hitch and her little heart pounding in excitement, despite the fact that she was clearly baiting him. "I recall you screaming yourself hoarse and almost melting my scale by bungling the power flow through the third set of runes."

Immi giggled throatily, her legs wanted to quiver at the memory.

"Well, don't I at least deserve something for my loyal service?" She tried.

"You're going to be getting a hell of a lot more of exactly what you deserve before we finish making this magical armour," Chris pointed out. "Though I suppose I could throw a spanking or two into the bargain. I am a magnanimous Master after all."

"Master, no!" Immi squeaked in mock dismay.

"Oh?"

"Well ... maybe a light one. So long as my tush gets a nice long rub afterwards."

"That's more like it," Chris grinned. "If you're extra well behaved I might, just might, consider talking to Michelle about you coming along next time."

"Yay!" Immi flung her arms around his neck.

"Alright, enough, little one, don't make me regret it. What's the time anyway? Am I allowed back in my own damn home yet?"

"Annabel said not before seven," Immi warned with an upraised blue finger. She was clearly proud of her babysitting role in whatever the brood had cooked up to reward Chris' hard work on their new home. "I'm to delay you by any means necessary. Mistress warned me that you'd probably become belligerent."

"I hate surprises," Chris grumbled.

"Belligerence," Immianthe nodded sagely. "Mistress is wise."

Chris' eyelids narrowed.

"You know, I could probably work you into spilling the beans somehow."

Immi's finger waggled back and forth.

"You'd have a hard time of it, turned into a billy goat."

"Touche, sprite. Well, I'm restless and it's a quarter to seven now. Why don't we go for a stroll through the Ether down on the street? That'll kill a little time."

"That sounds lovely," Immi admitted a little bashfully. Despite all the sex and playfulness, her times just being alone with Chris were often her most cherished moments.

For Chris, the otherworldly touch of the Ether invigorated as soon as he merged. The afternoon with Immi had drained his reserves, but now magic veritably poured back into him like there was a fire hose shoved down his throat.

The strange growths and alien vegetation that seemed to dog his footsteps here all waved or bobbed about in response to the return of his purple radiance. To Chris it seemed that they were particularly motile today. Perhaps, like neglected houseplants, they wanted watering with his energy after a few weeks of his absence. He felt a little bad to be leaving them all behind with the apartment suite, never to return. Perhaps Susan would be interested in harvesting some of them for the apothecary shop.

Immi's dull, translucent shadow shimmered next to the ghostly armchair they'd just shared, then she was beside him, fully fleshed in the extra-dimensional realm.

His strange purple eminence lit her dainty, upturned features harshly, making her appear uncomfortably rapturous.

"Mmm, I would just eat you all up if I could," the sprite cooed, entranced.

"I think Lillian might have something to say about that," Chris deflected. That look of hers was a little too intense for comfort. "Remind me to tell you the story about the goose that laid the golden egg."

"Oooh! Look, that wizard's-beard is blooming!" Immi looked past him, suddenly pointing and hoping excitedly. "And there's a crimson spoorleaf ready to go. They're all flowering!"

Chris followed her wild gesticulations, quickly realising that she was exactly right. Most of the Ether denizens around them were flailing unnaturally, as if churned up by a buffet of wind. Some visibly elongated as they rushed to unfurl flower buds, others wiggled or writhed disturbingly. One shrubby growth hanging near a ceiling light-fixture suddenly dumped a heavy, red mist from its dark, triangular leaves. The stuff came sinking down around them on lazy currents of shadow-air.

Immi tugged at his hand, pulling him away from the spectacular display.

"I guess I know what a crimson spoorleaf looks like now," Chris shook his head in puzzlement. "Why the plant orgy as soon as we show up?"

"We?!" Immi scoffed. "You big dumb-dumb, that was all you. I've never seen anything like that bef - eeep!"

Immi pulled up short just before they got to the apartment door. A roundish growth near the door frame was seething from within, dirty-white, but darkening as it swelled and its skin stretched. It was vibrant compared to the ghostly impression of the wall it clung on like a bloated barnacle. To Chris, it looked like a big old ball of garter snakes trapped inside a wrinkly old balloon.

"What the -"

A stress seam split the surface of the damn thing, then Chris was jumping backward with a yell as it ruptured.

What seemed like yards and yards of gooey whitish intestines burst forth in the blink of an eye. Chris cringed in disgust as sticky brown globs of unknown goop splattered down right where he'd been standing. The sickly innards still disgorged themselves, inflating over ten or so seconds to reveal themselves as a huge, goop-flecked ball of gross, interwoven tubes.

"I was going to say what the fuck, but that just doesn't cover it," Chris whispered harshly, trying to avoid disturbing the hollow, spherical framework of tubes that seemed to pulse and undulate in the dim Ether.

"Some sort of puffball," Immi explained inadequately. "I think they must be trying to get their seeds on you before you leave."

"Well I'm not cool with that!" Chris groused. "I don't need to show up to my own surprise party covered in ten kinds of plant jism."

"Hehe, they must have missed you, Master. But you have to admit, is an amazing phenomenon. I didn't realise the low creatures of the Ether reacted so strongly to you."

"About the only thing I'm ready to admit at this stage is that this walk was a terrible idea to begin with, and we should have just jumped home. There isn't any on me, is there?"

"Only a little," Immi batted at a few specks of yellow gunk on his jeans. "Don't worry, someone will scrub you down as soon as you get home."

"Huh, what's that supposed to mean?"

"Damn it! ... I mean, nothing."

"Immi," Chris loomed.

The sprite pounded her little palm into her forehead and held it there.

"I promised I wouldn't give it away," she lamented. "They weren't going to tell me because I couldn't be trusted and now I've gone and given the suprise away. They're never going to trust me again."

Chris couldn't help the huge smile on his face as he pulled the distressed sprite into a hug and gently tousled her hair. He still didn't really have any firm idea what the surprise might be, but if Immi thought she'd just given it away then he probably had the leverage he needed to prize the rest of the secret loose.

"Don't worry little one, do you know what this means?"

"What?" His distressed little princess looked up.

"This means you're on my side now, my inside man ... err woman. If you just let me know what I'm in for, I promise I can act surprised. Annabel will never have to know that you spilled the beans on her special project."

"Rrr - really? You promise?"

It turned out to be harder than Chris expected to play his part after he found out about the evening of teasing, pampering, food, and sex he had in store.

When he and Immi jumped into the imposing entrance room of their new home, Chris wanted to dive right in and let the debauchery begin. To hell with the surprise, his cock was on the fast train to hard-town already. It would be a sure giveaway if Annabel saw him show up with a rampant boner.

So instead he put on his best disgruntled expression, kicked off his boots, and edgily stuck his head around the doorframe into the big living room with Immi tagging along nervously at his heels.

The first one he saw was Michelle, seated at the big dining table with a big glass of red wine and her nose in her tablet. She was wearing just a silky black robe, which didn't help his anticipation problem.

He smelled and heard Annable working on something delicious in the kitchen, but his keen ears were focused down the house toward the open bathroom door. The faint splashing sounds that drifted to him, as well as a burst of Claire's playful tones we like a sirens call.

"We're home," Immi announced half heartedly as Chris skulked toward the kitchen.

Michelle turned their way with a knowing grin, while Annabel startled to see Chris halfway into her kitchen domain before she'd realised.

"You're early," the slim brunette protested, hand on hip.

"Only a few minutes," Chris ogled, looking his highschool sweetheart up and down appreciatively. Annabel too was wearing a bathrobe, though hers was pink, fluffy, and short enough to be indecent. She looked hassled, almost sweaty from her efforts, her deliciously exposed thighs already looking pink. She was absurdly sexy for it. He didn't want to wait to unwrap her.

"No, Babe, I'm not finished in here," Annabel gestured him away when he advanced for an embrace, lusty intent written clearly on his features. She grinned mischievously as he acted crestfallen. "Go see who's waiting for you in the bathroom. Michelle? You're on guard duty, make sure he doesn't have too much fun before I get there?"

"I'm thinking," Chris mused comically. "Yes, I believe you have my attention. Lead the way."

"Good!" Annabel threw back at him with a playful swat. "You'd ruin all this effort with five minutes loose in here."

Chris' eyes caught up to what his nose had been faithfully signalling for a while. Platters and plates of elaborate finger food, some of it still hot and steaming were strewn around the vast kitchen on nearly every available bench or perch.

"Hey, is that prosciutto? No way, it is! I would now like to retract my previous desci -"

"This way to the scantily clad dragonesses," Michelle interrupted, taking him gently by the elbow.

Chris teetered for a moment, salty pork had its own merits.

"Damn, you know me too well. You coming Immi?"

The sprite bounced fretfully on the balls off her bare little feet for a moment, glancing guiltily between the two who held the strings to her heart.

Annabel's eyes narrowed at the furtive body language, which was enough to make the sprite scamper away after the dragon and his dark-haired escort.

The goblin brothers had outdone themselves yet again. The new house might lack for a personal or unique flavour in some respects, especially the bedrooms, which were carved into the bedrock with clone-like regimentation. The main bathroom on the other hand was an instant hit with the brood. Dubbed the 'harem's spa' by its three diminutive creators, the huge, tiled space lived up to its name when tastefully furnished under Petra's keen eye.

The huge, partially-sunken tub that filled the far third of the rectangular room could more accurately be described as a small pool. It was more than large enough to fit the entire brood, comfortably submerged in an extravagant volume of magically tepid water. The dragon motif was perhaps overdone with the row of saurian shower-heads and faucets jutting out along the entire left hand wall, complete with clawed feet for taps.

Chris took in none of these details as Michelle pressed warmly against his captured arm, speaking softly as he paused in the threshold to appreciate the view.

Claire and Hailey were splashing water at each other, shrieking and chasing each other through curls of rising steam like nymphs.

Petra and Susan watched tolerantly from the sidelines, reclined on wooden pool chairs and sipping fruity concoctions. Instead of the warm water, they were bathing in the stored sunlight emitted by specially enchanted crystals mounted in small recesses on the tiled ceiling.

What captured his attention was the display of swimwear and tantalising feminine charm. By far the most conservatively dressed was Susan, wearing a turquoise form-fitting, skirted one-piece bathing suit.

"Personally, I think you're spoiled enough as it is without us organising a whole evening of bikinis and sex," Michelle purred at his side, shrugging off her robe to reveal all her softly toned glory squeezed into a tiny white two piece. "But I've got to toe the party line, and I'll admit, by the look on your face Annabel may have picked the perfect reward for all the work you put in to make our family secure and safe. That does deserve rewarding."

"Wow, just ... wow," Chris was almost salivating as the girls took note of his arrival and their play came to a wet, jiggling halt. Claire smiled wickedly and dragged the smaller blond woman up out of the water by way of the inlaid stairs.

"Pace yourself," Michelle teased, detaching herself as Hailey was led shyly to him by the assertive young dragoness.

She was a beautiful wee thing, golden skin gleaming with droplets and all her wonderful curves hugged and accentuated by scant, yet strategic blue fabric. Chris could clearly see her chest heaving from the water-fight, the protrusions of her big pink nipples impossible to hide with such a flimsy layer.

"Hailey has something to say, don't you, Hailey?" Claire prodded gently before she went on tippy toes to give her astonished mate a kiss. Her bikini was downright scandalous, a gaudy green colour which clashed spectacularly with her pale, freckled skin and fiery hair. "Go on, girl, tell him what you need."

Hailey glanced around at her audience in trepidation, squeezed her eyes shut and blurted.

"I want my pussy licked!"

This, of course, brought hoots of laughter and encouragement from Claire and Petra. Michelle shook her head in bemusement and chose a spot next to the older dragoness on the thick, knee-high edge of the sunken pool which also housed an array of newly-potted ferns and succulents.

Hailey peeked one eye open tentatively as the ruckus died down.

"Gladly," Chris growled, lust overcoming his initial surprise at such a bold request from the usually timid werebison. Stepping forward, the beautiful young woman was easy to sweep off her feet and into a passionate, squeezing embrace.

"Bring it over here, lover boy," Claire called to his right, drawing his attention to a curtained-off section of the room he'd been too distracted to take in.

Behind the thick, velvety drapes Claire pulled aside was someone's sturdy-framed double bed. The brood had obviously dragged it into the steamy room in preparation for the evening, shoving it lengthwise against the wall to conserve space.

--------------------------------------------
Despite Immi's forewarning, despite Hailey's wide, excited eyes and the tailor-made love nest, Chris couldn't quite believe what this night had in store for him. His cock was already aching for action at the thought of it. His dragon preened within, one very happy beast. The intimate audience smiled back at him, indulgent and knowing. Michelle was right, this night was going to spoil him, possibly forever.

Hailey shook her way through two climaxes in short order once Chris set to work. Her fuzzy blond muff was already primed, fat and dewy before he even got his tongue into play. By the time his fingers entered the slippery fray, the little werebison was a creamy, quivering mess of pleasured nerves.

She eventually pushed his head away from between her trembling thighs, demanding to return the favour.

Chris enjoyed himself immensely as she familiarised his cock to the delights of her soft lips and playful tongue. Her fingers, gods, her fingers were expert. But it was torturous in its own way, knowing there was a lot of hot, willing vagina waiting for him right on the other side of the heavy drapes.

Hailey surprised him though when she lay him on his side and proceeded to delicately stroke him off against the softness of her sexy tummy. She looked up at him so lovingly, sighing contentedly as she guided his big hand to her sprawled tits. They were almost face to face on their sides, kissing and nuzzling, humping their bodies together with an almost-innocent fervour.

Looking straight at him, his throbbing knob prodding her soft skin and treating her to delicate, insistent touches, Hailey whispered that she wanted his cum. She told him in no uncertain terms that she wanted to taste him, to rub him all over her so that she stank of him. She said she wanted to feel his magic racing through her, and that she was going to stop taking her doses of pheromone cancellation portion soon.

Chris' eruption was already rising along blissful, unstoppable paths of tension and imagination when the buxom little woman executed her coup de gras.

"I think I'm almost ready to try out this big thing you know." Hailey purred as he thickened, thrusting jerkily against her precum-slimy fingers. "My latest toy arrived in the mail today and it's crazy-thick. You should see it. I can't believe I'm abusing my little hole for you like that, but it's gotta be worth it to handle this beast."

"Hailey ... ahh ... ngnnn," Chris grunted back, eyes squeezing shut as her words and touch spurred his twitching cock to the very brink of release.

"This little muffin is going to be all yours. Imagine that, all juicy and creamy and squishy when you work this beautiful thing into me. I can barely wait."

That did it for Chris, who thrust himself almost violently against her and began spewing thick, pearly lines of spunk all across her abdomen. Hailey giggled delightedly at his orgasm-wracked grimace and the seemingly endless fountain of semen rapidly making a mess of her tummy, hands, and the disheveled sheets. He reflexively pawed her tits as he grunted and groaned in release, but she embraced that as the compliment it was no doubt intended as.

They were both spattered and splotched when Chris finally opened his eyes to gaze down at his naughty little brainiac in wonder.

"Wow, I bet that's something else when you do it way deep in me."

Chris groaned, covering his face with a hand as his penis twitched to her teasing words. He pulled her hands away from his balls lest he lose control of himself. Her wrists were easy to capture above her head, allowing Chris to kiss the tease right out of her.

They only enjoyed a few more moments of sticky cuddling before Immi barged to announce that he was required for his next 'engagement'.

Hailey was true to her word. As Chris wrapped a nearby towel around his waist and prepared to leave, he was treated to the head-swelling image of the little blond minx laying sprawled on dark, spoiled sheets, sampling his seed off of the sensuous lines of her abdomen. That was too much for Immi to bear, and the sprite pretty much launched herself at Hailey, flapping raggedy to tackle her on the bed.

He might have stayed to find out just how sharing Hailey had become with Immianthe, but his name was called from outside in a lilting tone that conjured all sorts of wonderful possibilities to mind. The night had only just begun.

His effort at modesty made Claire twitter in delight. She snatched at his towel and it soon lay in a heap on the tiles. The bossy young dragoness took his hand, parading him past the others, down the broad steps and into the warm water.

Chris' attention was entirely captivated by the curves of her back and the lovely way her hips and rear-end widened. This was his mate, and the visual cues to her fertility weren't diminished at all by the fact that her womb already swelled with his twin daughters. The lime-green bottoms of her bikini were very tight, digging into her sumptuous flesh in ways that made his hands twitch jealously.

Claire chose a spot in one of the corners nearest the door, pushing Chris down into a submerged wooden bench so that he was facing the rear wall and his attention would be all for her. She knew that with his size and incredible strength he could easily resist her bossing and manhandling, indeed it was rather exciting when he did. However it made her heart thrum most when he was putty in her hands, so big, lovable, and gentle. An oversized puppy.

Mounting the bench on top of him sploshed the warm water all about them, even up into her loose auburn hair. With her feet firmly placed on either side of his trunk-like thighs, Claire lowered herself, breath escaping in a rush as the water line hit her sensitive bits. Squatting frog like in his lap, she took his adorably worshipful face in her hands, leaning down to delicately kiss his slightly swollen lips.

Chris watched her nose scrunch as she inadvertently got an intimate taste of Hailey. His pregnant mate cocked her head in a rather reptilian manner, a dangerous little smirk forming at the corners of her mouth. One of her hands twisted in his shorthair while the other dove into the water, capturing his half-hard penis by the root.

"No funny ideas," Claire husked, pushing herself close. His manhood butted up against her bikini covered mound, rising jauntily up out of the agitated water. She trapped it between her swelling stomach and his firm torso, just as she knew would drive him crazy. "Do you like my new bikini? We all got them especially for the occasion."

Chris dropped her captivating green gaze to look down between them at the marvelously scant green garment. His hands stroked appreciatively up the outside of her smooth thighs, over her butt, and up to settle at the slimming of her waist. In their position, her modest breasts bulged forward, pert and hanging perfectly above the upper curve of her pregnancy. He hardened fully once more as she slowly rocked herself against the sensitive underside of his penis.

"I'll take that as a yes," the dragoness chuckled, flicking wetted strands of red hair behind her ear as she leaned back in to kiss. "They're starting to get bigger, you know, my titties."

"Claire," he groaned.

"What? They are," She feigned innocence as her hands fumbled underwater to pull aside the flimsy fabric forestalling their sex. "Now just relax and enjoy the ride."

Ride him she did, their bodies splashing in lustful, passionate rhythm. The water was no hindrance, as a dragoness, Claire had her own sexual quirks to match the males of their species. He would never soften inside her if she willed it, not that he needed the help right now. Though her womb was obviously off-limits at the moment, she could still produce a copious flow of lubrication to help ease the way for a randy mate. Their coupling was as juicy and slippery as ever despite the water trying its hardest to wash away their junk-gunk.

Claire's thighs and legs burned, and working for her pleasure made different somehow, all in her control. She sweated with the effort of raising and lowering, taking his rampant maleness in such a physically taxing position. It wouldn't be long before her condition prevented her from enjoying such poses. The heat and work was exciting though, and when she began to falter in the buildup to her release, he was ready.

Chris took over, helping to lift her up and down, thrusting just a bit from below so that he bottomed out, filling her completely .

"Fuck you and your big dick," Claire hissed when he did that, looking down at him with such hungry, accusatory eyes that he couldn't help doing it again, knowing she was built for that and more besides.

Claire's body was on fire, overheating with the sex, with so much exertion, and with steam and splashing hot water. It was perfect, almost as if she was riding him in a bed of embers and lapping flame. She tugged at his hair as her climax finally crested, burying his face in her chest with arms wrapped crushingly around his head. She clung to him as blessed release washed through her, lungs robbed of air by the hard, hot lump of steel filling her aching centre.

Then, Claire clawed helplessly at his shoulders when he didn't stop, finding herself rising inexorably toward a second orgasm as he thrust mercilessly from below. Her mate plundered her needy little hole without apology because he had earned the right. That throbbing spear of male flesh didn't yield one bit, delivering hot, undeniable friction to every inch of her straining, bucking pussy.

Susan and Petra burst out laughing when Claire shuddered and squealed through a second, more intense storm of pleasure. One of Chris' big thumbs was firmly pressing her love-button beneath their lapping fuck-waves.

Claire peeked her eyes open and playfully flipped her two broodmates the bird over the tops of the potted plants, right before the heat of Chris' cum began flooding into her already stuffed insides. She summoned a final burst of energy to madly grind her hips against his spewing cock. It was his turn to squirm and groan as she humped him ragged. Her lips found his as magical potential thrummed around their tight coupling. Claire thrust her tongue into his mouth, claiming him, squeezing him tight with her entire body until there was nothing left and his spend floated white and denatured around them.

She started down at her mate, panting and flushed with exertion. He looked insufferably pleased with himself, blue eyes meeting her boldly and the beginnings of a knowing smile on his lips. It might be illogical, but it galled that he seemed to know just how to service her, always wringing more pleasure from her body than she bargained on. Dragon instinct welled up within her and before she could think about it further, her palm swung forward, connecting hard with his cheek.

The slap resounded off the walls as the young dragoness darted back in, capitalising on his astonishment to roughly kiss his infuriating lips. His eyes were satisfyingly wide as her hand plunged into the water, yanking him out of her by the root even as she bit his lower lip and dragged it backward.

"You fucking beast," she growled low over the churning bathwater, grinding the fat, sensitive helm of his cock relentlessly against her gaping, cummy labia. It was the wrong angle for penetration but she crushed her meaty vulva down on top of his apple-like knob until he cried out.

Forehead to forehead, eye to eye, Claire was on the verge of releasing control. Who knew what would happen then, but surely the rest of the brood would be disappointed if she dragged him into the grotto and didn't let him out for a few days. She would be monumentally sore afterward, but rutting him into submission in her half form might just be worth it.

"Claire, I -"

"Shut it," she purred dangerously, slowly regaining control of her wild desires. She released his absurdly hard penis to bob up between them, butting her forehead gently against his own. "If I catch you going easy on anyone tonight, you're going to get it."

Bewildered, unsure exactly what he'd been threatened with, but unwilling to suffer the consequences of challenging his pregnant mate's logic, Chris just nodded his assent. She smiled challengingly down at him, caressing his reddened cheek affectionately before she splashed out of his lap.

It was Claire's turn to smirk as she hiked the snug green bottoms back into place over her sensitive, fuck-swollen mound. Feeling much better, delightfully brimming with magic and after-tremors, Claire sauntered up the steps out of the big tub. Soaking wet and feeling unstoppably beautiful, she completely ignored her mother's cocked eyebrow and went in search of Annable and the promise of food.

Susan came down the steps to into the pool a few minutes later. After a little cuddling and washing, she took him back to the curtained alcove. They embraced, kissing hungrily as the witch shimmied out of her clingy swimsuit. The loving passion between them had redoubled since their reunion on the moonlit beach.

Knees perched right at the edge of the bed so that her shapely bottom hung out in mid air, Susan offered her bushy, creamy slot up for plunder.

Chris rose to the challenge, slipping his broad cock deep in one smooth, gentle lunge, precum already spouting from his tip. Susan gasped, clawing at the sheets as her lover mounted her like a stallion, draping himself across her back.

Kissing and nibbling her neck, Chris began a deep, lazy humping that quickly had Susan's fuzzy lips frothing with buttery juices. The sight of their strained coupling drove him wild, her pink labia stretched thin to accommodate him, her pubic hair matted down and clinging to his cum-streaked, sawing cock every time he withdrew. Her womanhood bulged out between silky pale thighs when he thrust in.

Outside, they heard the commotion as food began to arrive. Neither of the mating couple paused or slowed in the least. In fact, the young man began pumping his hips faster.

Susan never took long to get off, especially not when Chris began churning away at her like a man possessed. She giggled at his eagerness to finish with her and satisfy his bottomless appetite for Annabel's cooking. She found it endearing in a strange sort of way. Relaxing, arching her bottom just a bit higher to receive his vigorous thrusts, Susan focused solely on enjoying all the wonderful sensations his penis ignited as it plunged back and forth inside her. It was sort of tricky to summon the concentration to squeeze down on him when he was pumping her so hard that his testicles swung forward into her upturned clitoris, but she managed and was rewarded.

He came first, a torrent of warmth splashing against her dilated cervix with an accompanying grunt of primal masculine satisfaction.

Susan shuddered as his magic surged, shoving her the last few steps into just the type of deep, body-twisting pleasure she needed from him. Her clitoris throbbed, and she cried out his name in supplication. He pinned her bucking hips with unnatural strength, holding her fast. Susan knew what came next, moaning unintelligibly as he somehow mated the tip of his swollen penis to the narrow mouth of her womb and began pulsing mighty gushes of seed directly where it belonged.

The sueth-azoah quivered at the centre of her being, sharing in every maddening surge of twinned magic and sinful heat launched into her core. It and Susan were more and more attuned these days. It was easier to convince the strange organism to keep its errant roots bottled up now that she had Chris' cock on the regular once more. His doses of magic did wonders to calm its eternal quest for energy, tempering the ancient plant into a less urgent state of quiescence and cooperation.

She still managed to accidentally poke holes in the sheets with a few dark protrusions along her forearms. She was just trying to hold on, the sueth-azoah was just trying to help, the mattress suffered the consequences.

In the height of their lust, oversensitized and out of breath, Susan threw her head back against his naked, sweaty chest and let out a keening moan. The entire household knew her satisfaction as Chris almost collapsed on top of her, thick seed beginning to leak from their swollen coupling.

There was no sugar coating it, Chris was beat after Susan. Despite being conditioned to sex three or four times on a quiet day, he could tell there wasn't much left to give. His penis throbbed, red and almost painful to touch. Immi had taken her toll that afternoon. Thank goodness Susan had taken it easy on him with her plant-like appendages and her internal ... weirdness. The thought of more sex at that moment almost made him whimper, much as that shamed his dragon.

The temporarily hung curtains of the little carnal alcove swished, and Immianthe's gradually deepening voice twittered in delighted tones.

"That's so cute, Master are you all tired out?"

Chris groaned, the insatiable miniature woman was about the last broodmate he needed pestering him to perform.

"Thank you, sweety, that was lovely," Susan kissed his damp hair as she extracted herself from the tangled sprawl of their overheated limbs. She stepped into the discarded swimsuit on the floor, and Chris couldn't help admiring the way she wriggled back into the clingy garment. "He's all yours, Immi."

Immi pounced on his back as Susan left, giggling madly at his wordless noises of despair. Her lips plied nibbling kisses up his spine, her breath warm on the back of his neck. She was naked, dark navy nipples scraping teasingly across his clammy skin.

"Master, you're not even halfway. We can't have you dropping off just yet."

Chris complied with her attempt to turn him, rolling into his back to face his stacked little tormenter. Resistance was futile, and he was in no state to suffer a zapping.

"You're entree is served," Immi grinned imperiously down at him above a beautifully peaked blue cleavage that already put her mistress to shame. She settled her wings daintily against her shoulders, one finger held posed in the air. "No food until you've finished your aphrodisiac."

His eyes followed her other hand as it trailed down across her sculpture-worthy tummy. Chris was unsurprised to discover the sprite holding her dewy cleft open, showing him she was as pink as could be on the inside.

From there, Chris' memories of the night blurred a little. Immi's sweet little love-box produced a heady, creamy flow of novel, likely magical simulants. There was undoubtedly some sort of intoxicant or mild narcotic in her fragrant fluids too, because Chris' penis bounced back with the unrelenting fervor of one of those inflatable arm-wavey monstrosities.

He pounced on Annabel as she came from the kitchen with a platter of thinly sliced meats, dipping sauces, and fresh, piping hot flatbread. She squealed in surprise, then mock outrage as he burst naked and rampant, from the love-tent.

She'd discarded the fluffy robe, revealing her own choice of crimson, lacey boy-shorts with a matching camisole for the evening's entertainment.

Chris snatched up the tray of delicacies with one arm and put the kicking, giggling bundle of scantily-clad fiance under the other. Prizes secured, he tramped victoriously back toward the small pool, only to find the rest of his broodmates enjoying the warm water already. They were half submerged around the edges, talking and snacking happily from a high-sided floating platform that was loaded to the gunnels with all sorts of tasty morsels and finger food.

"Quick, eat up ladies," Petra laughed at his wide-eyed stare, popping a juicy green grape and a piece of cheese between her lips as Annable regained her feet and led their lucky lover down to join the others.

"Hey, where's Lillian?" Chris asked, finally noting the vampiress' absence amidst the overwhelming display of wet skin and tantalising undergarments.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 13|
--------------------------------------------
"She's like a boss monster in one of those video games we used to play," Annabel laughed as she settled sideways onto his lap in the water. "If we unleash her too early she'll ruin all our fun. Besides, she said she'd have a hard time controlling herself with all the attention you're getting."

Annabel snagged the platter from his hands as he pondered her answer. She expertly prepared a chewy, juicy morsel of roasted lamb, dunking it in spicy plum sauce before wrapping it in a strip of buttery, flakey roti. His lips were open expectantly, almost drooling when she reversed course and popped the savoury treat into her own mouth instead of feeding it to him.

Chris growled, and the tray was almost lost to the depths in the ensuing tussle. When the splashing and playful noises died down, Chris had recovered some of the flavour from her lips, but Annabel emerged with the upper hand. The flimsy gusset of her little shorts was designed to rip, and his fat, almost-hard helmet now nestled just inside her opening.

She was magnanimous in her victory, feeding him from the floating island as it voyaged around the big tub on gentle pushes. He hardened within her as they sat spooned together, but they didn't move, instead joining in conversation with the others as they ate.

Michelle and Petra were leading a discussion on how the Synod and the existing territory structure were going to integrate with human nations and states.

"I just don't see it," Petra shook her head, sending dangling golden earrings swinging into her damp hair. Wet, it took on a darker tone of grey which brought to Chris' mind an almost-forgotten encounter with a mysterious lady gargoyle. "There are so few Beings, most humans outside a territory hub will never even see one of us in their entire lives, let alone interact."

Chris sighed contentedly, warm and supported by the water with Annabel's butt nestled snugly in his lap. His penis twitched as she leaned forward to reach a plate of cheeses, and the cheeky look she shot at him over her slender shoulder made his chest swell with love and affection.

"It's already happening, I think you'll be surprised," Michelle countered as she loaded fig paste, blue cheese, and a slice of pear onto a buttery cracker. "There's going to be a huge demand for magic in the private sector. It will mostly be a novelty at first. But once Beings don't need to worry about staying hidden, magic will eventually become commonplace. It might take a generation, maybe two, but there are also going to be a lot more Beings by then."

"Well I'm doing my part," Claire joked, patting her tummy affectionately. "I think Michelle is right though, Mom. Chris was almost kidnapped just so Dr. Mayer could get her bony old hands on him. I have to admit too, from what she's shared with me these last few weeks, there's potential to completely upend some aspects of both societies. I mean, our blood could literally cure metastasized cancers."

"That's amazing, Claire. It's too bad integration will have to be a gradual process, though," Hailey added. "The last thing anyone wants out of this is massive upheaval. Human leaders will have to limit the way magic is introduced to the general population in order to prevent fear mongering and resentment from getting out of hand. I mean they turned Chris and I down on nearly free, unlimited, clean energy. I mean, I get why they did it, but it's still disappointing."

"Hailey's right," Michelle nodded her approval. "Short term, all aspects of magic will still have to be strictly regulated. A lot of work will need to be put in to spin this all in a positive light, which is the most important reason why I need Chris involved in the effort. Long term though, and all you magical types should be thinking long term, I predict our societies and way of life will be fundamentally different with magic in the open. You can't put the genie back in the bottle once you've discovered a new technology. Magic is going to be a new currency, a new expression of power. That's what all this back and forth between our leaders ultimately boils down to, they're trying to divide a fresh-baked pie, and squabbling over who gets what pieces before the damn thing is even out of the oven."

"Only, the Synod and territory leaders already have dibs on it," Susan pointed out. "They aren't about to give away their positions and influence for nothing, at least I really hope they won't. For better or worse, our little magical islands completely rely on them. In some ways we Beings are going to be even more vulnerable to cultural and economic disturbance when the time comes."

"Oh, they certainly won't," Michelle nodded her agreement. "They're digging their claws in on issues where it matters. Judicial powers, freedoms of movement, association, self defence. There are some huge long-term benefits too, and I have to give Reyla credit for spotting them before I did. That is one damn smart, conniving elf."

"Like what?" Claire asked, intently interested.

"Well, for one, asset accumulation. So far Beings have been limited by needing to keep their wealth relatively hidden from mundane scrutiny. That's actually become a lot easier recently, at least for the technologically savvy. If Beings are allowed to be open about it, what's to stop a dragon or elf with a potentially undetermined lifespan from slowly buying up property or taking over human businesses and supply? On a thousand year scale, that is entirely plausible."

"And I would imagine it's hard for human leaders to deny Beings equal rights of ownership without exposing their own top-heavy hypocrisy." Petra saw what Michelle was getting at. In the long run, Beings could gain a position of leverage in human society, slowly sifting themselves to the top. Whether or not they should was another question. It would be a dangerous tightrope to walk, and she was glad not to be infected with ambition. A happy, fulfilling life with her mate and brood was enough for her, and maybe just a modest chamber of plundered Dwarven treasure.

Annabel began rocking her hips ever so slowly back and forth as she and Chris listened to the brood continue to debate. The merits and pitfalls of the Revelation were quite fascinating, but she had something else occupying her mind, and her needy insides. She squeezed rhythmically against his deep-buried erection, which was both delightful and maddening. Chris' patient indulgence seemed nearly limitless though, and he didn't give in and ravish her, as she'd half-hoped.

Together they helped feed each other from the vast array of delicacies Annabel had spent all afternoon preparing. He heaped effusive praise on her culinary skills with every new juicy morsel or unlikely combination of flavours she came up with for him to try.

Eventually, despite their audience, Annabel put some real effort in and began shoving her marvelous rear end back into his lap with powerful short strokes. Chris could never last with the upper quarter of his cock snugged firmly inside her baking little womb. She was in complete control, and just like a dragoness, her cervix trapped him, squeezing so firmly that his knob felt like it was swelling bigger and bigger with every pulse of excited blood.

It was a wonder that his seed wasn't choked-off below the head. Of course it overcame her resistance, bursting free from his tip in great, shuddering gouts that had them both gasping for air. They held each other with death-like grips, rocking thorough extended waves of release and primal pleasure, their surroundings irrelevant for a few blissful minutes.

Michelle was next, leading him away from the crowded bathroom to the seclusion of the huge utility closet down at the end of the left hallway.

It was dark and warm, the big aircon unit was humming away loudly as she backed herself against a section of sturdy plastered wall. With an incredibly sexy smile, she glanced suggestively up towards the ceiling.

Chris followed her eyes upward, a lecherous chuckle rising in his throat as he registered the two d-shackles attached to newly installed rock-bolts. A short length of thick, soft rope hung from each, though they were currently tied up out of the way in a neat bow.

He glanced back at Michelle in time to see her white bikini bottoms side past sleek, powerful thighs, crumpling around her ankles.

"Hurry up and untie it," Michelle laughed at his expression of confused delight. Her hand strummed over her sensitive labia, spreading the slick heat already leaking in anticipation of being hammered into the wall by his powerful body.

She startled him when the ropes fell free, taking an experienced grip on each that involved several loops around her lean forearms. In a flash of athleticism, Michelle swung up and wrapped her legs around his waist like an Amazonian constrictor.

Chris' breath left him in a rush as she used the supporting lengths or rope to lean her entire body up and against him. Their lips met, firm and giving. Her tongue darted in, then she pulled playfully away, jerking back with all her considerable strength, crashing them into the wall with a bone-jarring slap of skin on stone.

The message was clear, and Chris growled in satisfaction as he took hold of her thighs and plunged roughly into her clinging heat.

Michelle keened against his collar bone, and for a moment they were still, gazes and bodies locked together. They began thrashing together like a pair of spawning eels.

Petra nursed him back to life in the little bathroom tent as the others chatted in the tub over dessert. First she massaged his lower back, then flipped him over and peppered him with kisses while gently sliding her juicy mound over every inch of his wilted penis.

In typical Petra fashion, she whispered all sorts of lewd devotions against his skin as they pressed together. She could be absolutely obscene when she wanted to be, and there was something about him screwing every brood member in one evening that was really turning her dragon instincts into overdrive. The minty scent of her mating pheromones made the moist air thick and heady. Her words, touch, and buttery vagina inevitably resuscitated his flagging penis.

"Are you sure you're not a necromancer?" Chris half-joked, glancing askance down between them at the throbbing erection she'd summoned.

"Maybe I am," his beautiful mate laughed throaty as she got up on the balls of her feet to align his tip with her dewy, coral-pink slit. "But we dragonesses keep our secrets close. Mmhhmhmhmm! Yes, that's it, Sire, all the way ... fuck! Ffffucking god damnit, make me ... YES! Uuuungh! Serve that little bastard an eviction notice, Momma needs her spare room back."

"Woah, you're in a special mood today, huh?" Chris sat up so they were eye to eye as she frantically impaled herself on his dick. Looking down, her sex spread wide around him, glistening with rich, tacky moisture.

"You've been driving me crazy all evening," she hissed back, fingers clawing at his shoulders and up into his damp hair.

Petra absolutely crushed her breasts into his solid chest, reveling in the raw power of his body, the power of his cock moving within her. When they were apart, her loins yearned for him. When they were together, their physical compatibility was electric and undeniable. They were just two serpents writhing in the grass.

The thought of loving him like this for the next few thousand years released a shudder deep within her hungry insides. It raced up her spine, setting her neck hair up, and out to her tip-toes as they began curing against an onslaught of overwhelming pleasure and love. They were mated dragons, beautifully drunk on each other.

Chris managed to pick himself up, find his discarded boxers, and stagger back to the relative safety of the hot pool, accompanied by a very smug dragoness.

He just floated for a while as his brood chatted and snacked. Annabel, Immi, and Claire began dancing at one point, connecting over shared love of a catchy song they'd discovered recently. Chris indulged the wanderings of his drain-addled mind, the wonderful contradiction infecting his limbs, so heavy, yet buoyant in the supporting warmth.

Eventually he went in for a second attack run on the ample leftovers put aside underneath the potted plants at the raised edge of the tub. This was taken as a signal that he was open for business once more.

Hailey led his brood, requesting cuddles and back-scratches. The gentle minutes that followed, skin against skin, just holding and touching, were more profound in some ways than an entire evening of sex. Her milk gave him back some zest too.

The others took turns as well, but it was getting late. Susan and Michelle said goodnight and went to bed. Hailey bought in something to read, happy to linger at the edge of the conversation, her petite little form stretched out on one of the deck chairs. Annabel and Immi were leaning from tipsy, toward wasted, and Claire was goading them from the sober sidelines. Petra, claimed his lap like a throne, straight-backed and regal.

He'd almost fallen asleep under the charm of her gentle head-scratches when Immi's excited chanting made him jolt upright.

"Unleash the beast! Unleash the beast!"

"Immi, don't, that's not nice -" Annabel cut off as she stuck her head out into the living room. She was grinning crazily, pupils huge, as she rushed back and scooped the mischievous sprite into her arms.

"Unleash the beast! Unleash the beast!" they chorused together.

The bottom of his gut fell away into empty space as Chris registered the distinctive, slow clack of heels on hardwood.

Petra chuckled deep, kissing his chin before walking up and out of the tub. He was all alone, left staring in both wonder and dread toward the vampiress' approach.

She came naked, every aspect of her exaggerated femininity on display. Her face was perfectly made-up, hair long and loose, a rich brown mane tumbling over broad shoulders and outthrust breasts. Every inch of pale, perfectly creamy skin, pebbled nipples, and swaying hip was bare for all to see. Every inch, that is, except for the meager fraction concealed by her clingy fishnet body-stocking.

"Lillian, that's no fair, we're supposed to wear bathing suits!" Claire laughed as the vampiress sauntered past, black eyes locked on her target. The little lines of criss-crossing black string cut in against all her softest, bulgiest parts. The effect on such a curvy woman as Lillian was breathtaking, and Claire marveled at her confidence to wear the garment.

"Dear, at this stage it hardly matters," Petra noted as she began shooing the youngsters out the door. She looked back before she left, Lillian's huge bottom was cocking side to side, absurdly propped up on five inch black stilettos. She glided over the steps leading down into the water as if they were no hindrance at all. Her young mate was transfixed, staring worshipfully up at the avatar of Venus. "Jesus, Lillian, go easy."

The lights dimmed, the door shut, and Chris was alone with the flinty-eyed vampiress. She was a vision of curves, of sex, of coiled power, and deep hunger. She swished through the thigh-deep water, fingers trailing across the surface until she towered right above him. The smile on her scarlet lips wide and ravenous.

Chris almost whimpered, his fingers twitched to grip her string-laced hips, but another part of him wanted to sink underneath the water in a vain attempt to hide from the black-eyed creature. Served him right for encouraging her to explore her vampiric side.

"I'm that scary, huh?"

Chris looked up to see her smile at a coy half-mast, brown eyes twinkling with friendly mirth. His friend was back, the fiend was gone. Her beautiful eyes laughed at him.

"You forget, I know what it's like to perform again and again like that. Even if you're genuinely enjoying yourself, it all takes a toll." She ruffled a blessedly talon-free hand through his hair, the other coming sensuously to her hip. "This was all for their benefit, young one. You did so well. Tonight I'm as gentle and sweet at a kitten, I promise. Why, what were you imagining that had that pretty face going pale?"

"Ha! Thanks, seriously." Chris relaxed, his pent lungs dumping breath in relief. A daring hand came forward of its own volition, brushing his knuckles across her enrapturous flank. The touch was soft, yet it sparked an undeniable current of affection between then. They came together slowly, Lillian settling sideways in his lap. "Actually I was thinking about a few weeks ago, when I ... you know, your butt. I think that would actually kill me right now."

Lillian laughed, eventually covering her beautiful wide lips with a netting-gloved hand.

"Oh you are just adorable!" She felt her heart lurch with love and desire, at his shyness in the face of that wonderful shared memory. Though currently bottled away inside, there was less straining at the chains from her darker nature, more purring and haunch waggling. "You went to town on my little back door, Chris, and you loved every moment of it. You squashed that chocolate spider good, and it was just what I needed."

"Make it stop," Chris groaned, illogically embarrassed.

"I wouldn't do that to you tonight lover, we won't even have sex, if you like."

His penis twitched beneath her big rump and they both burst into giggles.

"Let's not be too hasty," he grinned.

"Just like that? A little reverse psychology?"

Lillian could take him like no other, there was an intoxicating physicality to her, like she always wanted more than he had to give.

They started slow, Lillian on her back, cradling him lovingly between her thighs as she sighed through several gentle, gushy climaxes. His balls churned lazily against her ass, working overtime to come up with something, anything to plant deep in this gorgeous woman.

He was almost numb, almost painful, but she was so wet, so hot and responsive, so perfect for his huge body to cover. True to her word, Lillian was gentle as a kitten, loving and tender as he slowly churned the depths of her. It was amazing, but now he needed more. She would love more too.

Chris shuffled her legs up into his shoulders, pressing himself deep.

"That's it, oh Chris, yes that's it, unngh!" she grunted so sexily as his broad, throbbing crown barely feathered her cervix.

Her thighs and bottom squashed against him when he saught for purchase, and she cooed breathily beneath him, irrisistibly flushed with sex as they pressed together. He could feel her warm juices bathing every inch of him, walls squeezing, caressing.

He got his feet underneath himself and started lunging down into her from tip to root. She laughed delightedly as he pushed her legs higher, pounding away, his enormous testicles slapping wetly against her butthole.

"More, young one! More!" She grinned, powerful hands stroking his burning thighs, teasing his balls. Her beautifully huge breasts jostling madly between their sweat-drenched bodies. His knob was bumping bottom now and she still wanted more. "Unngh, unngh, dah, dah, daaaahhh!"

Buried to the absolute hilt, Chris erupted with a guttural roar. He held nothing back, not from her, not ever. He would give her every drop of strength he had left.

Lillian felt his huge cock swell in a mighty lurch, heaving out a few hot stands before trailing off into runny leaking.

His eyes squeezed closed and he moaned low and deep as his body hunched again and again in painful, pleasurable, empty spasms.

Lillian put her legs around his waist as he collapsed, all that delightful strength bleeding away from limbs so powerful just moments ago. She held him close against her neck, feeling guilty as his breathing hitched with exhaustion, almost sobbing.

"That was perfect, my love, my little zaichik," she whispered in his ear, husky and thick with her native accent. "My heart beats for you, and my tummy grows every day with my love."
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Chris summoned the last of his mortal strength to kiss her.

"Not so gentle at the end there," She teased as he fell asleep.

Lillian rolled them to the side of the bed, shifting his dimorphic bulk with the ease of an experienced grappler. She telekinetically grabbed two pillows to prop under his head, refusing to dislodge his wilting penis before absolutely necessary. For several minutes, she just laid there watching him breathe, studying his sleeping face and adoring the boyish contentment she saw there. Too many Beings were divorced from true connection, she decided, from love.

An urge to masturbate bubbled up into her consciousness, a yowl from below. The vampiress thought they should pleasure themselves with the seed leaking between her reddened lips and the thing still filling the needy gap between her hips. Perhaps it is right, but he was done, and deserves his rest.

Lillian chuckled to herself as he slipped free of her messy quim, marveling that the big-little boy-bunny actually covered all his mates tonight. She would tease him endlessly tomorrow about the grotesque face he made at her in the height of his efforts. The vampire fell asleep like that, one hand over her barely-domed tummy, the other holding him close against her.

***

That night may have been destined to go down in infamy, or perhaps it served the dragon's brood right for thinking up such a diabolical, irresistible reward for their mate.

Exhausted, and in less than complete control of his faculties, Chris dragged the entire household into the Ether as they slept.

In hindsight, the new house's spellwork may have acted as an impromptu network or magical framing, allowing Chris to unconsciously carry them down into his realm between dimensions. It certainly saved lives once they were there, bleeding off energy in sacrifice for the several hours of terrifying, lucid dreams they all experienced.

The maelstrom of wild, discordant magic spewing out of the dragon's new den was so blatant, so jarring to magical senses that it was felt outside of the Ether. Members of Reyla's security team arrived on the scene within three minutes. They tried in vain to raise a response, then began attempting forced magical entry when no reply was forthcoming. Rebuffed, they woke Lady Narlakis.

Annabel bolted upright with a gasp of tortured relief. She was in her room, in her bed. It took a moment to shake free of a vivid replay, to catch her breath and realise that she was at last awake. But she was freed, as a pinch of her thigh seemed to confirm.

Shaken, still reliving flashes of endless headlong, running, Annabel turned to Immi's wakeful noises, compassion and love flooding her thoughts.

For a breath she relived the endless flight, her and Immi. In the dream, they'd fled never-quite-seen, tireless pursuers through a nighttime scrubland. Otherworldly cries rang out in the night, calling each other, taunting, and ever closer. They were being herded. The things were slowly corralling them, like joyously baying hounds deep in the bloodlust of their hunt.

Annabel knew Immi had been there with her, that the sprite had shared the terrible dream at her side. She just knew it. Somehow, they'd been sharing that terrifying, lifelike experience. Annabel knew that before she fully woke, before it even registered that they were in the Ether, or that Chris had not returned in the night. She was just so relieved to be free of that terrible, horrid dream.

Immi sniffled beside her, sitting up, vivid blue against the dull Ether-outlines of their room. They looked each other up and down in the dim, grey and blue toned ambience, and thought the same thing.

"Quick Immi, go check on the others. I'll find Chris and beat him awake with something. I'm going to murder him if this is some sort of joke!"

"Anna, I don't think it is," Immi shook her head like a wet dog, trying to rid herself of sleep-fog. The taste of the Ether around her was thick with power, absolutely saturated. It was coming from her beloved dragon, but for the first time, it felt ... icky. There was no temptation at all to nibble at a corner of it. More than that, Immianthe could feel something malign nearby. A slowly throbbing pressure nagged in the back of her skull. Something ghosted her magical senses, a vast shadow circling them slowly, something from deeper waters. They were in danger. "Something's wrong, something's happening to him."

"Go get the others Immi! Quickly!"

They scampered off the bed with a grave sense of purpose. Immi launched herself off the end of the coverlet, flapping jauntily. More drunken turkey than dainty princess, the sprite only made it halfway to the door before she touched down. Annabel might have laughed but she was too frightened, too busy trying to focus. She had to steel herself and Bartholomew for the unknown, for magic and danger. Clarity of thought, purpose of will, mental flexibility, these were the foundations of a successful magical encounter.

Annabel barely registered the brightness shooting from the open bathroom as she raced to find Chris. She just came around the corner, and there was this purple beam blocking her path, so shockingly bright it imitated substance. She was blinded instantly, her eyes overloading as the heat of it licked against bare skin. In a short nightie with not much covered above or below the torso, the sensation was unpleasant in moments.

"Well, fuck!" Annabel hissed to herself, covering her eyes with her hands. Her tapestry of focus frayed, then completely disintegrated, the power she and Bartholomew had been gathering flowed out of her grasp like oil. She turned away to rub at furious afterimages pounding across her vision.

"Who's there!" An unsteady Slavic accent called from ahead, from somewhere on the far side of the doorway. "Annabel?"

"Lillian?" Annabel almost didn't recognise the vampire, was her voice actually shaking?

"He ... he burned me, Annabel, be careful. It's bad, but I'll make it."

"Oh, no, Lillian! Stay still, we'll get help?" Annabel didn't dare open her eyes again to look for the vampire, she could see white through her eyelids, bright as a childhood glance at her father's welding torch. "What's going on -"

"Out of the way! Move!" Petra barreled up behind Annabel, barging past in a headlong lunge, straight down the yawning gullet of correscating light.

Annabel sensed a brief dimming as the fearless dragoness leapt through the doorway in blended hybrid form. She didn't know what to do, paralysed by indecision as Bartholomew gnashed the tips of her fingers. He was frightened, desperate for any constructive outlet.

Cries of shock and dismay announced the prompt arrival of the rest of the brood, and Annabel turned to ward them back into the safety of the little diamond room, and the vast magical reservoir. Just the indirect heat was as if the bathroom doorway now led to the heart of an arc furnace, with that power, Immi could surely create some sort of powerful barrier.

Annabel would try it herself if push came to shove. They had to reach Chris, to turn him off somehow before he magically microwaved them, or something equally horrific. She didn't want to even consider going up against one of his spooky orbs gone rogue, or if that was what they were up against.

"Stay back! Close your eyes! Is everyone here, Immi?"

"Everyone woke up at the same time, Mistress. They were already coming." The sprite called back.

With a tortured snarl, Petra flung herself back out of the doorway, burned despite her scales, routed by light and blind several times over.

"Mom!" Claire shouted, rushing headlong into her own transformation as her mother collapsed to the grey, monochrome floorboards.

"Shit, shit! What do we do?" Annabel almost prayed, her fists balling impotently. She heard a thud, a grunt, a scuffle and a drawn-out clatter. Eyes peeking through bleary, watery slits, she saw a huge, red serpentine head. Petra was dragged back to safety, clutched between gentle jaws. Michelle and Hailey were around the corner, yelling at Claire not to squish them, beating ineffectually at her haunches and thrashing tail.

Great, now they had a giant Claire to deal with too. At least she was small as dragons went, though more likely than most to incinerate the furniture. Right now Chris was firmly at the top of the list for worst dragon in the house.

Susan vaulted forward around the tangle of broodmates, growing gnarled limbs to push her back and forth rapidly between door frame, ceiling, and dragon. The woody appendages and wall-gripping agility gave her gate an unsettlingly arachnid appearance, but Annabel was so relieved she could have kissed the woman. The witch's flowing dark hair was in complete disarray, but she held Immi firmly against her hip, her other hand shielding her eyes as she advanced.

"You had dreams too?" The witch asked, pulling Annabel gently away from the door and taking up her position beside it. Dark, fern-like fronds extruded down her forearm. They both watched the things dig into the ghostly wall, extending reluctantly over the portal. The worst of the radiance and heat cut off in moments.

The sueth-azoah wanted to squirm, to shy away. The light was so hard that it actually tested the incredible resilience of the ancient plant. However, the relief its shade provided allowed their eyes to adjust a little. Susan held fast in her desire for it to persist a while longer.

"Thanks Susan, I'm glad you're here. Yeah, Immi and I both had these crazy visions. It was shared too, we had the same one. Right, Immi?"

The sprite nodded absently, absorbed in watching the vast, dangerous ripples of unbound energy sheeting outward in every direction. There was an underlying draw there too, harder to detect but insistent. Magically, it was like two mighty ocean currents brushing over and under each other at depth. Chris was both drawing in and pushing out monumental forces in the Ether.

"I had dreams too," Lillian rasped drily from the kitchen. "Terrible, ancient battles."

"I had to watch poor old Jethry horribly tortured," Susan admitted, shuddering in the grasp of vivid recollection before she continued. "This has to be caused by something. We're all here, in the Ether, we all woke up at the same moment as far as I can tell. We need to think calmly now, to look for a cause."

"But what do we do about ... about this in the meantime?" asked Annabel, flinging an unsure gesture toward the luminescent bathroom beams seeping out through tiny gaps in Susan's now-glowing shield. Susan was right, but there were immediate concerns to address too, she favoured triage and action to ward off mounting fear. "Lillian is hurt. Petra couldn't do anything, bless her. Is he still asleep in there, how is that possible? And why the hell are we all in the damn Ether anyway?"

As if summoned by her plea for answers, the very fabric of the universe ruptured.

Annabel didn't actually see it happen, she was knocked sideways into the wall. It felt far more substantial against the side of her head than was fair, given their ethereal surroundings. She'd once seen Chris leap straight through a wall.

A thunderclap like a dozen simultaneous lightning strikes momentarily dazed her of already frazzled sensibilities.

Annabel started, determination fighting upward through a heavy blanket of pain, confusion, and sensory overload. Her ears throbbed. She was slumped against the wall, her body tangled with something soft, boney, and weighty. Of course it was Susan and Immianthe, she realised moments later.

Annabel heaved her entire body upward. She had to do something, anything but surrender to the beckoning maw of unconsciousness.

Vomit surged into her throat the moment she gained her feet. She held it down by will alone.

Woozy, slow shuffles were all she could manage as her bearings returned. Susan groaned beside her, cursing under her breath as she too picked herself up. Thankfully her outgrowths still blocked the worst of the violent photons.

"Proscribed," Immi muttered from the floor, eyes bleary and unfocused. "Tessellation pr ... proscribed."

Annabel was just thankful the sprite hadn't been too damaged by whatever hit them. She spouted nonsense at the best of times. Her tune changed when Immi weakly raised an accusing finger, and Annabel saw that the sprite was in fact, quite lucid.

There was a tiny, darkness-rimmed hole in her living room. Meat was coming through. There were long, three dimensional polygons of neat, perfectly carved, geometric meat apparating in her home.

Annabel screamed, shrill and long. She didn't mean to, but she screamed with just about everything she had left. It was wrong.

They came on and on, zipping through a wobbly little silvery disk of nothingness. It looked like a liquid quarter suspended in mid air by darkness alone. Her mind shied away from focusing on it, but in the moment, that peculiarity barely registered.

It was the flying blocks of flesh that caught her eye, that sent adrenaline howling through her arteries like a cold north wind. Square after square, triangle after triangle, a hexagon every now and then. One by one, neat as you please, a thousand semi trucks rolling in convoy.

Her brain couldn't be working, she refused to believe what she was seeing. Pieces of flesh were flocking through into her living room, schooling about in mid air like agitated fish. They were dark and so finely cut on the leading face, but the cross sections were gruesome, far too detailed, and dripping along their length with disgusting seepage. For an instant, she thought she'd seen part of an eyeball, or the dull flash of metal.

The disgusting swarm twitched as one, jolting into coherence as a final wet chunk materialised and the miniature rift vanished without fanfare. Individual pieces suddenly found volition, racing toward the floor, slotting together by some predetermined pattern or strict order.

Annabel did vomit when she realised that there were two dainty, dark-skinned feet rapidly assembling themselves on her new floorboards.

It was some bloody, swishy, nightmarish parody of a child's block game. Square in the square hole, triangle in the triangle hole, simple?

Lady Narlakis was coming, some assembly required.

***

First, returned a hundred lifetimes of bottled anger.

Rage the likes of which would snap a weaker mind. Then unquenchable pain, the ultimate test of will. For pain was but an illusion, another sense like sight, or taste, and potentially just as delicious.

So Reyla endured the blinding, searing pain as reconnecting nerves registered the trauma done to them in tessellation. She had been burned alive once before, and this was worse, if only for a few moments. Pain to anger, anger to rage, rage to force of will, and onward, smelting slowly into ironbound control.

Though the interlude of existential agony was expected, and Reyla was no stranger to pain, the power of the sensations rocked her returned psyche to its foundations. In a way, it was a most powerful affirmation of life and purpose. That was what she believed at least, and it had served her well so far. A lot could be accomplished if pain was no barrier.

There were good reasons such spells were banned, of course. Many lacked the mental fortitude to survive the process intact, though their physical bodies returned to perfect health in a matter of days.

Considering the magics involved, and the reality of what she'd just done, Reyla considered it a small price to pay. It only lasted a few seconds, her neurons soon registering that they were once more knit seamlessly together, and that their stocks of vital transmitter molecules were recovering to normal levels.

Reyla was back, and she was spitting mad. Her gamble had been successful. The young dragon couldn't defend from an avenue of attack he'd never imagined. It was no sure thing, using such a series of complex spells, but it was all she could think to do when just minutes before, his aura began to flare so dangerously.

Of all the fool things the boy had done so far, of all the ... tonight? This? A whopping great barrier of wild, impenetrable magic at three in the morning? After all the sniveling about being unable to hold one, this was irony on a majestic scale. The evidence was stacking up that he did these things to her on purpose, illogical though that may be. That she even considered that that might actually be the case drove her wild.

Reyla decided she was going to flay him, to slowly peel his skin. Just as soon as she made sure he was okay.

Without even opening her eyes, the elf took her first breath. Her naked toes registered the cool texture of wooden floorboards, despite their ghostly, malleable appearance.

Reyla took a step toward the incredible nimbus of discordant energy dominating her senses. She had to stop him, to stop this mad draw of power permeating through the Ether. Though she could admire the remarkably efficacious barrier she'd been trying to dissect for the last hour, this new madness had to end right now.

By instinct, her thumb trailed over the activation runes on two of her rings. The times she'd employed such magic in the past were almost exclusively to deal destruction and death to her enemies. So she summoned battle robes to address her nakedness, and her scourge to address her dragon problem.

The leather-bound shaft of her old weapon felt good as it materialised in her grasp, heavy, and giving just a little as she squeezed. It had been a long time since she'd had need of it, and a bloodlust thrill shivered through her at the reunion. By touch she twisted the bone ring on its haft to the position which would induce debilitating, diaphragm-bruising breathlessness. She banished the six-inch blade tip that turned the weapon from magical rod into short spear, into steel-belching death-thrower as needed.

It might be more satisfying to introduce him to her creation's harsher settings, but expediency was her goal now. It was apparent the mad young dragon had no qualms about killing himself, and possibly half of her city in the bargain. And he was supposed to be lying low.

Already her senses probed at the vortex of repellent energy just ahead of her. Once again, his untrained, overactive imagination had spat forth a new challenge. Another obstacle the likes of which she hadn't quite seen before. In the balance, that was to his credit. He'd just forced her to use at least two proscribed, incredibly dangerous spells.

Chris wasn't boring. Perhaps that was why she was falling deeper and deeper into infatuation.

"Not now, girl!" Reyla snapped as his chief mistress started forward out of her stupor, an unformed, no-doubt banal question on her quivering lips. She lashed at them out of instinct, establishing her authority, reassuring them with her familiar airs. "You, witchling, pull back those filthy tendrils when I am prepared. It is good to see at least one of you has some sense. I can smell barbecue of ungrateful vampire, and look, the blueberry gnat is down for the count. Delightful!"

Up close, it was obvious exactly how the dragon was spending that colossal draw he put out into the Ether. Inside his defences, aspects of his spellwork were suddenly laid bare to her superior arcane knowledge. The elf snorted, realising it was all a giant house of cards held together by huffing and puffing.

When his magical spore had redoubled a few minutes ago, she'd been forced to pull out all the stops. It was good that she did, too. What she saw now was about the most inefficient use of energetic potential she could imagine. The wastage spilled from him, photomantic conversion in every band. Light so potent as to puncture cloth, flesh, and even stone. However, Reyla was no stranger to the notion of dangerous wavelengths, visible or otherwise.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 15|
--------------------------------------------
The dragon must still be asleep, locked in some fever-dream, struggling against phantom enemies. She'd theorised that previously, but this confirmed it. He would not knowingly put his little broodmares in such danger.

Once more, she tugged at the thin, ever-present leash of energy coiling back to her nexus. It expanded in her mind's eye, and once there, it took only moments to find and select the incantation she would need from the vast library at her fingertips.

Opening that rift, even on such a small scale, had cost her a century's hoarded power. But Reyla had been laying away magic on a timeframe that would boggle the minds of mere mortals. She was also in possession of a most wonderful golden magical goose, if she could keep the beast from destroying himself.

Her solution was elegantly simple, as the best always were. More-fool Lillian for not seeing it, though the version taught to vampires was much more limited in function.

"Now, witch!" Reyla commanded, never doubting for a moment that she would be obeyed.

The pre-hung spell raced toward her, up and up from her nexus, the tether yawning wide for a moment as it squeezed though. Darkness enfolded her, completely binding, all-encompassing darkness. It reminded her of home, of the pitch black caves she'd explored when she managed to sneak away from her mother's minders.

Reyla vanished into a hazy blur as she stepped through the doorway, light bending seamlessly to either side, then crashing back together and scattering wildly in her wake.

It was easy to find him, even without the use of her eyes he burned like an open flame to her magical senses. It was hot. She almost tripped once, tangling in some ethereal shadow of fabric or curtain hung in the room. It was a good thing he'd had this misadventure in the Ether, his new house would be on fire if he tried anything like this foolishness in the Norm.

Judging she was close enough, her shins bumping what must be a bedframe, Reyla wound back blindly with her right hand. The scourge came down with more than a little vindictive glee.

She heard the big lout's breath evacuate his lungs in a deep, violent rush. His spell collapsed almost anticlimactically. That wouldn't do, so she hit him again for good measure, and was rewarded with a satisfyingly wheezy groan.

Judging it safe, Reyla released her invisibility spell and turned off the nerve impulse function on her scourge. It was just a fancy weighted rod of wood and metal now, and as she towered over his shaking, naked perfection, she snarled as relief and frustration both broke free inside her.

"Idiot!" Their eyes met as she brought the dead weapon down across his thighs, so satisfying to vent her bottled emotion. Then again and again before he could stop her, it all came out in a rush. "Idiot, idiot! Cretin! On the night my mother arrives?! You loathsome, ungrateful beast! I'll ... I'll -"

Reyla didn't get a chance to finish her threats or his well-deserved beating.

Along with the dragon and all his rallying brood, she was floored by the arrival of a mental presence so vast, so incomprehensible, that they were struck dumb where they stood.

It was on them in moments, inside them, inside their minds. A thing so vastly powerful that it brushed aside Reyla's millennia-honed mental barriers like flotsam before a hurricane.

It knew her. It knew every detail of every atom, every thought, every cell, every memory, every private fear and dark desire. It was not gentle, and it was not pleased.

So the elf thought, as she gaped like a dockside brained fish at the scale of mental violation done to her. The dragon had good reason for his midnight photomancy after all. He'd been trying to keep a god at bay.

Reyla felt her jellied legs give out as it finished sifting through her head, looking for what, she couldn't begin to guess. The thing found her tether and rode effortlessly back down it, dissecting the secrets of her nexus without judgement or sensor.

There was a brief reprieve as it turned its colossal attention to the others inside the house, and finally back to its errant child. For that must be what this was, Reyla reasoned. If not the dragon's celestial patron, then who? An elder demon? One of the great foe-beings from legend? Unlikely, given their continued existence.

She was undone, ruined. There would be no hiding this night from the Synod, from her enemies, from her mother. The extra scrutiny would fray the delicate tapestry of deceit she'd woven. She would be laid bare, along with the dragon.

It would be a miracle if she even survived to face that feeding frenzy, let alone escaping this encounter with her sanity intact. Too much of this mind-riffling and her brain would begin to bleed. The geometric pattern of her recent travel would be etched through her flesh and bone for days still, structural weaknesses unlikely to hold under prolonged strain.

"Enough!"

Reyla shuddered, somehow the thing spoke, and every syllable hurt.

"I denigrate to speak this bleating tongue lest your idiocy dash all this effort to nothing. Desolation drag me down along with you, it may be what I deserve for leaving such as you unsupervised."

The jaunty, booming voice lashed directly into Reyla's mind. The Devine didn't really speak, it couldn't. It had no bodily presence here in the Ether, or anywhere else, she suspected. Instead, it made itself understood. It seared words into her neurons by direct stimulation. It hijacked the inner workings of her brain without a second thought, and dabbled there as it pleased. It made her simultaneously hear, read, and recall the words, dredging up long-past memories. She even felt them flash across her fingertips in four different arcane languages used by the blind.

Chris groaned audibly beside her, somehow managing to move under the immense mental pressure it exerted.

"Temper your flailing!"

Reyla's head rocked back and she screamed in chorus with his broodmates scattered throughout the house. Her skull felt like it wanted to split in two. They would die like this. If it spoke death, every cell in her body would reluctantly obey.

"I felt you tugging at this accursed muck like one of them, and came to warn you against it. It can be felt, and our foe is resourceful."

The entity chuckled, or that's how it seemed. Reyla felt it rattle her bones.

"You have grown stronger, my little minnow, my indulgent experiment. And, I see you have multiplied. That is to be commended. Your struggles were ... infantile, but that is what you are, an infant. So remember your place and heed me now! The enemy's servants are here, I can sense their taint. Root them out before they damage our works. If you allow them to come again in force, you will be left to your fate. I will have no part in more of that foolishness."

Reyla processed the words, the warning, the priceless information direct from the celestial horse's mouth.

"I must leave here lest your companions succumb to their frailty. Remember, do not grasp at existence until it rips, the results are inherently capricious. Coax, finesse, seek knowledge as you grow, accomplish more with less. And do not resist my presence like that again! Farewell for now, little minnow, you show such potential."

"Wait!" Reyla managed, surprising even herself with hidden reserves of tenacity in the face of such ancient, mind-bending power. That this thing, this godlike potential energy lowered itself to direct communication was an opportunity that could not be squandered. Every syllable forced between her lips was a battle, slurred and garbled like she was speaking into a torrent of onrushing water. "How ... goes ... the war?"

It paused, and they all felt the bleed-through of bitter regret, betrayal, and sour hopelessness. The celestial entity weighed up a thousand-thousand placating lies and discarded them all in a moment. It let them touch the husk of a once-godlike resolve, slowly chipped and hollowed away over thirteen-odd billion years of defeat piled atop retreat.

"Badly!"

It left as abruptly as it had come. A shark swimming away from a school of bait fish too small to bother snapping up.

The problem was, Reyla hadn't realised she'd been swimming those waters at all. She hadn't truly understood that they existed, or that metaphorical sharks did either. Eyes opened, and the scale of her own tiny existence laid bare, she now clawed desperately just to hold onto the tatters of comprehension she had gleaned. She clung on, bludgeoning her considerable mental acuity to perform as she dove back down the rabbit hole, seeking refuge and self in the embrace and folding pattern of her nexus.

The disturbing part was that there had been an unseen, shark-infested-ocean all along, and she'd been swimming obliviously for thousands of years. Content in her superior understanding of magic, the power and privilege it brought her, she had in fact been blind all along. She'd guessed at Chris' origins, and spoken descriptive words without any comprehension for the reality they woefully described. Now she had a terrible, unforgettable sense of scale, and new meaning for words previously spoken in blissful ignorance.

Knowledge was power, immortal, but it could also be a hurtful thing. That sweet oblivion was gone now, forever shattered because she'd just experienced a few small ripples of that great shark's passing. In magical terms, it felt as though the earth was crumbling beneath her feet, falling away into nothingness.

Reyla's steel-forged sense of self surged, reinforcement rushed up to meet her retreat. She began re-knitting, and found herself sprawled on an ethereal bed beside the root of all her problems. She was exhausted to the cellular level, but she had enough left to satisfy one last pressing need.

Her scourge felt unbearably heavy as she raised it with rubbery arms. It reminded her of skirmishes thousands of years in the past, of fighting to the brink of collapse because victory and survival required nothing less. Survival was barely a challenge these days, but victory was an eternal battle, as nebulous and fleeting as peace, love, even the stars themselves.

"Aaarrhhhh!" She had no breath, no energy left for words, but her scourge communicated on a profound level. Reyla had a lot of feelings bottled up, and they exploded from the tip of her staff as it touched the dragon's bare skin.

She took pity after one pathetic blow, recognising the futility. They were well and truly tired together now, she and this dragon. Only now, she understood enough to question the wisdom of the choices that led her here to this moment.

***

"But how is she still alive?" Annabel paced behind the couch, thumping her fist on the dark leather corner as she turned for another pass. "I heard what she said about paradoxes, but that was a pile of burning horse shit. You can't just be both dead and not dead, cut yourself up like that and sew it all back together. How did she <em>do</em> it?"

Susan jumped in her seat as the fist came down beside her ear. Lillian noticed, and reached behind herself to grab the pacing young woman.

"Please, Annabel, sit down. You're driving everyone crazy back there."

"We should be more concerned with the message," Hailey voiced her thoughts as Annabel gave in and took a leg-bouncing seat, squeezing Susan's shoulder in apology. "The implications ... well they're not good. At least some of Chris' ability can be felt by ... by ..."

"Demons," Petra supplied from her bean-bag, scratching absently at her flakey silver scales. The last crusty patches around her belly button were sloughing off, and it was a delightfully itchy process. Brilliant new ones already shimmered underneath, and the baby below was just fine, as far as magical medicine could tell. "Just call them demons, it's the best word we have, and it's not likely to change."

"That shouldn't really be a surprise," Lillian said, looking around at the gathered brood. She met every pair of eyes, liking the determination she saw there. That was good, because they would need it. "We've suspected for months that he's unique, that his abilities are derived from unknown, powerful sources. I am pregnant after all."

"Yes, and I'm trying to ask what do we do with that knowledge?" Hailey stood her ground, holding the huge vampire's dark eyes and glaring right back. "What, in practical and magical terms, are we collectively going to do about that?"

Silence reigned.

Claire fingered the heavy lump of gold at her neck, glancing over at her mother.

"I think I should take over our magical defences," Immianthe suddenly announced, hopping up off the bare floorboards. The sprite leaped onto the big wooden coffee table around which the brood had gathered their council. She began to march, a little blue general rallying her troops for battle. "We don't want any more episodes of dragon-fuckery, and I've a few choice ideas about zapping if that mean-old-nasty ever dares to show his ugly face again! Who's with me? I say if it doesn't want to help, it can piss right off! I'll give it a mega-voltaic parting gift."

"You want to zap a Devine? We've got that on record, right?" Susan shook her head in awe. The whole experience had been sobering for her, utterly terrifying. Whatever that thing had been, however well intentioned its warning, it had nearly killed them just by showing up. Prudence would suggest they hope it never returned, and appease in any way they could if it ever did.

Immianthe, however, had the spirit of an angry kitten, and reckless courage in spades.

"It deserves it," Immi retorted with angry gusto. "Looking through our heads like that, frightening Master half to death. It's the reason he burned Petra and Lillian, you know. He was afraid to let it close again, he told me."

"He'll be okay, Immi," Annabel soothed from the sidelines, quietly collecting the excited sprite into her lap. "He's pulled through worse, he always throws himself into work when he's upset. You'll see."

"We may have a few ideas for magical defence," Claire added slowly, and Petra nodded her approval. "Though crystal refills will have to slow down if we want to experiment. I don't know anything about fending off demons though, does anyone?"

"Reyla," Annabel and Lillian spoke as one, turning to smile savagely at each other.

"How much leverage do we have with her?" Petra wondered aloud.

"She must have bribed the Fairy Queen something fierce to keep this quiet," Hailey reasoned, marveling at the political slipperiness of their ruling Lady. "There are global detection networks to trace any rift activity, that's why the Barrier exists after all. The Synod will want to know what happened. People on Maginet are reporting that they felt whatever Chris was doing all the way over on the East Coast."

"The Synod are bureaucrats," Lillian explained patiently, Hailey and some of the others didn't understand the way political power actually played. "They have their hands full. Reyla has more wiggle room there than you'd think, though outright lying will almost certainly come back to bite her in the ass."

"Do we ask for her advice then, her help? What if she wants in?" Annabel put the question to them all, voicing a possibility none of them particularly wanted to confront. "You're quiet, Michelle, what are you thinking?"

"Leave her be," Susan murmured, "she's confronting her sense of duty."

"You're right, I am, but it's okay, Susan," Michelle smiled wryly, removing the hand that had been pressed over her eyes as she thought in circles. "Immi's actually got the right plan of action. We start with small, achievable goals and focus individually on our strengths. We work as a unit to bring those strengths together, to defend ourselves and our home. We practice, we exercise, we gain skills, and we prepare."

"And Reyla?"

Michell paused, giving the elf some thought as she decided how to break it to them.

"Reyla is already as embroiled in this as we are, more so in fact. Some of you might not like to admit it, but she is. She just broke about a hundred magical rules, risked censure from her superiors, and cut herself into stewing meat in an attempt to help him. Her position and political power are now locked to Chris' well-being, and we in turn depend on her to protect us politically. Reyla is functionally a brood member, just minus the mind-blowing sex."

That hung in the air between the broodmates, full of quiet tension ready to ignite. More than a few nervous glances were shot Lillian's way.

"What?" The vampire leered back. "There's a reason you chose me to be his chaperone to this ludicrous private dinner next week. I'm not intimidated by Reyla, though she is a spiteful, canny bitch."

"So, I guess no more orgiastic evenings of sexy debauchery then?" Annabel tried to lighten the mood, though her heart wasn't really in it. "That one was my bad, ladies."

It was tricky to joke about having your mind sifted by some metaphysically superior entity. So was the prospect of their bitchy overlord becoming involved in their strange, finally settling family.

"It's no one's fault," Susan said, trying to make sure Annabel didn't have an opportunity to take blame upon herself unchallenged. "None of us knew he might be dangerous like that, on the brink of exhaustion. Chris didn't know either."

"I know Susan, thanks."

"When are we going to talk about the dreams?" Hailey asked as the brood quieted, haunted by their own recollections of the fateful evening.

"We're not," Chris rumbled from the doorway leading to the goblin-carved reception room. "It would be best if we all tried to forget what we saw."

Hailey actually squeaked, her whole body jerking in the squashy leather seat.

A mixture of disapproval, amusement, and quiet warmth met Chris' near silent arrival.

He'd just returned from testing some of the improvements Immianthe had suggested for their runic prototype. The chill and salty damp of a deserted Greenlandic shoreline still clung to his skin.

The nascent magical device hadn't melted into a pile of golden slag under stress, so Chris figured it was ready to at least introduce his ladies to. Their feedback would be essential, they were going to be some of the first to wear it.

After recent events, Chris couldn't rush it into service fast enough. He was tired of feeling handcuffed, of being overtaken by events as he struggled to right the previous calamity in his life, of putting his ladies in danger just by association.

Not that some overly-convoluted magical armour would do anything if that damn God-entity returned for another chitchat. He was still seething about that. It had called him minnow, and the assessment had been generous. That, that ... thing was a cosmic monstrosity, a terrible mismatch of an adversary. It was a hungry bear to his exhausted salmon, a heron to his freshly-spawned tadpole. It could skewer him from a plane of existence he could not comprehend, with a razor beak his soft flesh would never deflect.

He didn't appreciate its convoluted warnings, and abhorred its mental intrusion. That his mates had suffered its indignity this time was unforgivable. Its claims of ownership, even parenthood were rejected and void as far as he was concerned.

Drawn from tumultuous thoughts by their silent regard, Chris approached his gathered brood. Hailey looked like she'd been told off, retracting on herself, he brushed a reassuring touch against her upper arm.

"I'm glad you're all here. Would you please take a look at this and suggest modifications for comfort and usability."

Chris leaned over the back of the sofa, completely overshadowing the little werebison for a moment as he dumped the warm contents of a black drawstring bag onto the table. The thoroughly drained magical prototype slithered free, a chaotic jumble of precious metal.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 16|
--------------------------------------------
He needn't have worried about Petra's reaction. Still in her beautiful half form to speed the healing process, her nostrils flared and she leaned forward eagerly to get a better look.

"Chris," Immi whined, jumping out of Annabel's grasp to start sorting the various linking chains and golden tablets into radial order around the central facet housing his purple scale. "You have no sense of presentation at all."

Chris smiled weakly as the jumbled rune phrases were whipped into order, soon arranged like burnished golden rays around a cartoonish sun.

"And why should I, when the gorgeous architect is right here to do the presenting? Go on Immi, tell them about your invention."

Immi's blushes were tricky to notice sometimes, but when she finally looked up and met his eyes, her cheeks were adorably beetroot.

"Oh my God, look how many tiny runes there are on the ring in the centre," Susan marveled as she noticed secondary detail beyond the blocky chunks of magical script writ large on gold. The piece was a lavish example of both craftsmanship and magic, like some precious relic recently unearthed from a bygone golden era.

"That's just the framework and energy distribution construct," the sprite chirped happily. "The golden tiles actually spell out the possible incantations it can automatically manifest."

Everyone looked at Immi a little aghast. Chris was so proud of her, and found himself grinning heartily for the first time in a few days. Claire actually cocked her head in saurian curiosity, as if seeing the sprite in a new light.

"So this is why you've been sneaking away in the afternoons," Annabel teased her little lover. "Go on, Immi, show us."

***

It was snowing bitterly when Chris tromped down into their new home to collect Claire for their impromptu date.

That morning he'd been out helping Stephen on his latest project for a few hours after his magical chores. However, even brawny werebison had their limits when it came to working in the cold. When Chris saw the headline he'd been waiting for, he took the opportunity to make good on an overdue promise.

He found his feisty little mate in their grotto, sprawled amongst a massive pile of entangled bedding and blankets. It was sweltering, she and her mother had the little fireplace stoked high, blasting heat turning the decorated hollow into a kiln. A dragon hatchery, his inner voice supplied proudly.

Chris looked down on the two dragonesses with unbridled love, nostrils flaring as he caught their heady, mingled scents.

Claire looked up from her phone as he squeezed inside, smiling as she kicked her bare legs enticingly.

Petra actually mewled from her little nest, sleepily pulling aside a silky sheet in open-legged invitation. He'd already made love to her first thing that morning, chipping away at the growing backlog of empty crystals. Out of necessity he wilfully ignored her.

"Hey beautiful," Chris crouched at the base of the redhead's nest of pillows and blankets, leaning in to brush his lips against her shoulder as he spoke. "I promised you a date a while back, are you feeling up for an adventure?"

Both dragonesses perked up at that, their lounging posture shifting effortlessly to graceful attentiveness. Claire nodded happily, drawing him wordlessly down into a soft, passionate kiss.

Petra pouted a little as Claire disentangled herself and put on her discarded leggings.

"Don't worry, I've got plans for you later," he assured the blond dragoness, who wrapped herself tighter in her tangle of bedding to prove she was feeling sulky.

"Where are we going?" Claire asked as they embraced for departure. "Don't we need to take anything?"

"And spoil the surprise?" He replied, delighted by the anticipation he read in her expression.

"Go on then," she sighed indulgently. "You and your surprises."

It was a big phase, a long jaunt of unnatural, disembodied limbo through the Ether. They chased the receding nighttime out across the Pacific Ocean, crossing down into the Southern hemisphere, swapping Fall for the last days of an already hot, dry Springtime.

Over the past weeks, often at night if he was feeling restless, Chris had strategically travelled the world by orb and Ether.

His ability to phase from place to place was reliant, as far as he could tell, on committing to memory some aspect of uniqueness about the destination he desired. He could jump back to Jethry's farm with relative ease and safely, but not to somewhere he'd never visited or never seen. So he'd sought out remote spots on the other continents, sometimes spending hours just sitting, or practicing idle magic as he and his dragon got a feel for them.

The near-disastrous mission to Brazil had sparked the idea. It was how he'd discovered the stark beauty of Greenland among other places, perfect for his broadening experiments.

The advantages of such a network of places, to which he could arrive in moments, were obvious. Combined with his ability to punch through the sky at supersonic speeds inside a bubble of his own power, he suspected he could deploy to almost anywhere on the globe in a matter of hours. That sort of mobility was a godlike power in its own right, even if it left him exhausted and a bit woozy to execute, especially with a passenger.

He knew he was flexing his magical muscles somewhat rashly. After the latest harrowing visit from the entity Reyla named a God, he found it harder to care. Some of his human reluctance and tentativeness had shrivelled. That giant celestial asshole barged into his life without a second thought, invading his mind and traumatizing his brood. It did it because it could.

Radek played out his twisted plot because he could.

If might truly made right, as the world seemed to poke at him afresh every day, then why should he hold back? He knew it was a dangerous path to tread, a self-fulfilling road that might corrupt him, but no one else seemed to be restraining themselves for the sake of prudence, even common human decency.

So who was going to object to him using his burgeoning might to take his mate on a date? Why should he care if they did? Who would put their life on the line to stop him?

Smoke wafted, heavy in the nighttime breeze as Chris and Claire jolted out of the Ether, stepping hand in hand onto a carpet of rough, desiccated grasses and snapping twigs.

Claire looked around with a dragon's eyes, collecting herself after the discomfort of Chris' near-teleportation. She pierced the smokey darkness with ease, looking up to see an enormous, strangely branched tree arching above them. There was a distinctive scent to the strange, sparse forest he'd brought her two, familiar and potent. It was also really, really hot.

"Australia?" Claire guessed as the smell brought back memories of a playground her mother had sometimes taken her to long ago. It had had an enormous eucalyptus tree too, and she remembered being fascinated by the strange, fragrant nuts always scattered underneath it.

"Got it in one," Chris chuckled. "Now, how hungry are you feeling? A few hundred kilometres to the south there's a wildfire-front half the width of Colorado."

Claire blinked, processing what he'd said.

"Chris, I don't ... hmm, really?" Her initial shock was wearing off, and her dragon was warming to the bombastic extravagance of the idea. "This is crazy."

"Crazy-good," he countered, flashing a boyish grin of excitement. He'd been anticipating this for weeks now, watching for the right opportunity.

"It's crazy-crazy, you big ninny. I could never channel that much power. I can almost feel it from here, the fire is huge. I'd pop, Chris. Besides, won't there be a lot of people to see us? Firefighters, aircraft? The mental shrug charm weakens exponentially with more eyes to deceive."

"We'll be on the thick of it, no one will see clearly with all the smoke, so I'm thinking the charm will hold. It's not proscribed in the Revelation agreement. The other problem is easily fixed too, you're going to fill a crystal that should put us a month ahead of our orders in one fell swoop."

"It seems terribly risky."

"Come on Claire, cut loose, I've been dying to fly with you and this is perfect. We'll actually be doing some good too. People's houses and livelihood are going up in smoke, thousands are being evacuated ahead of the blaze," Chris leaned closer, murmuring enticingly. "We could do all sorts of things in the middle of a raging firestorm, who'd know?"

That last enticement seemed to do the trick.

They flew as full dragons, low and fast through the pre-dawn. His mate's excitement was palpable, her sinuous ruby-scaled neck arching back to snap playfully in his direction. She flew circles around him, quite literally looping over his stalwart flapping, darting and ducking through the hot, smoke-hazed air.

She was beautiful. As human, so as dragon, compact and elegant compared to his longer, bulkier form. Coached and raised by a true master of the skies, Claire's confidence in flight was something to behold. If he were an eagle, she was a sassy swallow. A swift interceptor to his lumbering cargo-jet.

Their passage went unnoticed as they sped south over parched forest and brown, desiccated farmland. Chris didn't know exactly how the charm Petra had drilled into him manifested in the minds of those few worried humans that looked skyward. Perhaps the dragons appeared as high-flying birds, or water-planes rushing to target flare-ups ahead of the raging inferno. Their minds shied away from the truth, seeing something expected rather than something fantastic. I'd didn't matter, so long as there were no screams and no cellular phones pointed skyward, no gathering of pitchforks.

Closer to the fire, it hardly mattered. Already hazy, visibility steadily worsened until even his keen, multi-spectra dragon eyes were confounded by the scattering effect of so many airborne particulates. The heat hit his scales like a physical blow, then they were in the midst of the firestorm, lofted violently by superheated air as it raced skyward.

Claire chirped happily, a dragon's laugh, and dove into a cracking wall of orange flame almost ten metres high. He lost sight of her, and circled warily above, listening to her crashing about between burning trees, roaring triumphantly as she drank down flame and heat on an unprecedented scale. She was in her element, and the fire seemed to lose its will around her as she charged about, rampaging up the flame-front.

Her serpentine head rested lazily on the pulped remains of a burning log when he landed beside her. Her back legs kicked out, throwing bright embers across her back and flanks. Her rounded, pregnant belly sat comfortably in a hollow bowl of hot ashes and scorched dirt.

"Too much," she purred up at him, rolling half into her side in invitation. "I've never felt flame like that, it actually fought me."

"It came off second best."

"You doubted?"

"Never, but imagining and seeing are different experiences."

The coals were near-painful on the scaled pads of his feet, and he marvelled at her ability, her aspect of fire. It seemed alien and incredible to him. He had a flash of perspective regarding how others must see his own Ether affinity.

She'd really sucked the marrow out of the fires's bones, enough for him to sidle in on four legs and snuggle down beside her in the charcoal. The burnt forest cracked and hissed around them as the two dragons entwined, red and purple.

Trees toppled to the passion of their lovemaking. Claire was so relieved when he proffered her a fresh-baked diamond. The thing would have come up to her knees as a human. Her body was teeming with power, full to the brim with converted heat-energy that wailed for a magical outlet.

She actually belched flames at the peak of her climax. Her beautiful ruby throat bulged as she writhed sinuously beneath him. She glowed from within as a pillar of almost-white fire and vivid, lingering sparks leapt from her roaring gullet. It was a violent, charring heat, lancing through several trees and setting them alight once more as the stream of fire shot skyward.

When they were finally done, it would have taken a trip to a carwash to tell them apart by colour. Both dragons were covered tip to tail in reddish dirt, grey ash, and dark coal. Both were grinning like happy hogs too, surrounded by the destruction and carnage of their unrestrained coupling, the complete unleashing of their dragons.

Eventually, Chris eased more control back to his human thought processes. As they lazed in the hazy, smokey early morning, he carefully began the process of crafting a complex Ether orb. There were a lot of parameters to anticipate if he was going to use it to carry them through the rest of the bushfire in comfort and safety. They were far from done with this productive little adventure.

Chris looked down at the huge, globular diamond clutched against his mate's belly, like a kitten with yarn. He'd made it big on purpose, excessively so, he'd thought. The thing was almost a third full already.

He'd underestimated both her, and the fire. The energy she could absorb from a large blaze like this one was incredible, definitely exceeding her rank classification. She was going to have a clutch of full diamonds to sit on if they went ahead and smothered this enormous fire all the way out, though perhaps that would be a little too conspicuous.

Two dragons rose back into the air, though their wings stayed tucked against their flanks as they nestled together. Encapsulated and conveyed by a huge ball of Ether force, they shot West and South, ready to head-off the roaring inferno. Inside the bubble of their conveyance, the universe's laws danced to a different tune, if only for a moment as they passed.

There were four different forks beside each ornate place setting. That was how Chris knew for sure that he was going to hate this dinner.

He could put up with being squeezed into a tight collared shirt and tie. The company he had to look forward to wasn't exactly the light-hearted type, but he understood the necessity. Besides, he owed Reyla at least several favours after her latest intervention. More of a rescue perhaps.

Who needed four forks? What the hell were they going to be served? It almost gave him the excuse he wanted to turn tail and scamper away home.

Annabel was making fancy sloppy-Joes and having a movie night with the rest of the ladies. Chris loved sloppy-Joes, and Annabel always sprinkled crushed potato chips in the burgers and gave him extra pickles. Instead of that, he had a four-fork dinner and an evening with Reyla's mother. From what he'd heard, the woman was a terror.

"They're late."

"Stop fretting," Lillian murmured at his side, her silk-clad hip bumping him. Long fingers squeezed gently on his forearm as she leaned slightly closer. "Try to relax. The old girl is nearly insufferable, she'll delight in toying with you if you give her a chance. Like the world's most sadistic cat with a wounded mouse."

Chris was about to protest that unfavorable comparison, but wasn't given the chance. The thick, iron bound elm doors at the end of the huge, church-ceilinged banquet hall parted ominously.

It was so typical of the elves to be late, a subtle assertion of dominance, yet one too petty to protest. More games of power and political movement, practiced over thousands of years.

Reyla's illumination charms brightened theatrically, shining forth from recessed alcoves high on the walls. A dark, white haired elf floated into view down the connecting corridor, heading a small procession. She was near the mirror of her daughter, or more accurately, Reyla favoured her mother uncannily.

Chris turned slightly, cocking an eyebrow at Lillian in silent question. She gave a tiny nod, but didn't take her attention from the advancing elf.

Matriarch Vash Narlakis really floated, and it had nothing at all to do with her preternatural elegance or grace. She cut a regal, imposing figure, clad in a stiff green dress of martial attitude, with padded shoulders and knee-length skirts. Silver threads glimmered from within the verdant weave. From his recent experience dabbling in metallurgy, Chris reasoned that the garment was reinforced with a magically sensitive alloy, probably mithril. No expense was spared in her defence, even in the heart of her daughter's sanctuary.

The clan Matriarch was indeed tall, slender, and graceful, like all of her kind Chris had encountered so far. But Vash towered over her trailing bodyguard and daughter, matching Chris eye to eye by virtue of being suspended a foot above the marble floor on a rolling hive of frightfully large, metallic-sheened beetles.

He was so dumbfounded by the absurd conveyance that all of his prepared manners and schooled responses flew out the window. He stared openly, barely registering the second, sword-toting, elf shadowing her mistress's disquieting train.

Reyla almost slunk in her mother's preposterous wake, bringing up the rear of the dark elf trio. The territory ruler struggled to master a sour expression, more suited to a petulant teen than a several thousand year old spellmaster.

They were big, ugly bugs. Earwig-looking bastards that strained upward, clawing and crawling over each other to perfectly meet each falling elfin slipper with a column of armoured insect flesh. Those left behind scurried to the sides, leapfrogging forward to the vanguard with all the speed and unsettling alacrity of a startled roach. Once ahead, they assembled themselves unerringly into chitinous stepping stones, repeating the cycle as Lady Vash advanced around the enormous dining table.

Chris was fascinated and disturbed in equal measure, imagining that it must feel somewhat like walking on a crunchy airport travelator. It made his skin crawl just watching, but it was mesmerising all the same. Magic, he was reminded, was old and bizarre beyond what he might personally imagine in a dozen lifetimes.

He was still looking down when the bugs slowed in front of him. As his attention shot upward toward the ancient elf's face, her amused eyes and teasing smirk, Chris realised that the distraction was all part of the elaborate, never ending game.

"Good evening, dragon," Vash Narlakis smiled down at him from her chittering pulpit. She offered a bejewelled hand, not to shake, but palm down, to kiss. "My my, you are quite the specimen. My daughter has been positively reticent, hasn't she?"

Chris looked from her dainty fingers, past an array of no doubt magically potent jewelry, up to the millenia-old elf's knowing eyes. Those eyes had witnessed firsthand events long resigned to ancient history, then myth, then forgotten entirely. The frightful intelligence lurking behind them was unknowable and devious, Chris knew. He silently vowed not to be toyed with, to stand firm and come out the other side of this meeting still detached from this latest font of elfin machinations.

Lillian tensed beside him as he lowered his head, but the motion brought Chris into a shallow bow rather than touching the offered hand to his lips. He knew enough to eschew any risk of arcane skulduggery. His last interaction with elven folk had left him wary, and he had no desire to get any closer to her pets.

"Welcome, Matriarch Narlakis. Thank you, it's my pleasure to provide passing entertainment to jaded old Beings the world over."

The elf Matriarch blinked, tasting his words for meaning before her lips quirked even wider.

"Oh I like this one, Reyla," Vash turned to include her glowering daughter, her discontenting conveyance unerringly anticipating even that small movement. "The whelp has fangs."

"His fangs are blooded already, Mother. Test their sharpness at your peril," Reyla spoke proudly, watching her dragon rather than her shamelessly provocative family member. She could see from the set of his shoulders and the slight flare of his nostrils that Chris was on guard. That pleased her greatly. "Lefayd put forth a meddling hand and drew back a bloody stump for their trouble. It would be just dreadful if you came all this way only to suffer a similar fate."
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
"Daughter, what a horrid...," Vash started theatrically, scolding first before she turned back to apologise with stage-worthy grace. "Please forgive her, Christopher, I do wonder that such a spiteful girl sprang from my own loins. She has certainly mastered the art."

Chris despaired as he saw Reyla's ear tips twitch in annoyance. These two could go around and around trading insults for centuries. In fact, he suspected that is exactly what had come to pass between mother and daughter.

"If I have learnt spitefulness, I must have received instruction somewhere," Reyla snapped back, her grey eyes narrowing. "I am not the one who -"

"Enough!" barked Lillian, fed up with being ignored as mother and daughter wound up for a spat. It was good that she was here to tell these two off before a certain dragon lost his patience. "You are both completely hopeless within a mile of each other. Yes, yes, the sun will burn out and we'll all turn to dust before either of you consent to agree on anything. We know. Let us at least get some food on the table so Chris can have something to do while you squabble over him."

That brought the feuding elves up short. Chris was both pleased and surprised by Lillian's approach, and took her example to heart.

"Oh, very well then," Vash consented, brushing aside the buxom vampiress' scorn as if it meant nothing. She made to claim the head of the table, which would gall her daughter no end. Vash spoke over her shoulder as Sifone, her most faithful retainer, trotted to keep up with the heavily enchanted colony flowing across the floor. "Hello, Lillian, I see you've forsaken my daughter to cling to a brighter star. How very predictable."

"Jealous?" Lillian replied with genuine mirth, cocking her hip as she brushed a possessive hand up and down Chris' forearm.

"Why, yes."

Chris found it hard not to chuckle. Reyla looked ready to erupt, bare moments from violent apoplexy. She caught his eye, glaring glass splinters up at him whilst in the background, her mother fussed and complained to her servant about the seating, the cutlery, and the decor. Finally she mastered herself, spinning away to gesture forcefully to her own patiently waiting staff that they were ready to begin service.

The evening that followed was more bizarre than Chris had imagined, and far more awkward. It was just cringeworthy to be trapped in the front row, audience to a family enmity so carefully cultivated over the ages. He'd had the barest taste of such conflict before, Annabel and her mother were both strong-willed women with clashing ideology, but these two had hundreds of years to really let their feelings simmer and develop flavour.

However, the food was excellent, and that was no small consolation for putting up with the wheedling, sniping exchange between the near-identical elves at either end of the great table.

It might even be better than Annabel's, though he'd never admit such a treacherous thought. Delicate, horrifically expensive fare had been shipped from all over the globe to pander to the great elfin Matriarch, though none ever drew her praise. By the second course, a flight of enormous fresh oysters, deliciously seasoned inside their own shells, Chris was beginning to appreciate the merits of the multi-fork layout. The servers hadn't taken one away yet, which he determined meant that there were at least three more such delicious courses to look forward to.

Chris mostly left mother and daughter to their own devices as they circled and snarled over his fate. Vash seemed to think she had some sort of hold over Reyla, and through her, the new wealth of magic crystal and economic clout he represented.

Reyla was adamant that she was independent of any clan or familial obligation. She pointed out that this exact brand of meddling was the reason she had abandoned her mother's subterranean fiefdom and sought temporal power of her own long ago. She had no trouble recounting word for word the ridicule she'd endured from her family for that decision, despite the many centuries in between.

Chris found it a fascinating insight into the minds of such ancient Beings. In short, Reyla was firm that the dragon was hers, and her mother could politely keep her skeletal fingers out of the pie, unless she had something significant to offer in return. Her presumptive possessiveness irked him a little, but he realised that it was mostly symbolic. He couldn't exactly reject the notion if he also wanted to shelter under her political wing. Reyla was sort of like his defence attorney, and her mother was definitely worth having a barrier against.

There was magical prodding going on too. Apparently Vash had been quietly researching Chris and his sudden appearance in the few days since she arrived. This issue had already come up during the soup course, pumpkin with fried garlic and pine nuts. Reyla was irked that her own mother had been wandering the compound offering her subjects rich bribes for juicy tidbits of the dragon's story. She was very curious about the night of the bathroom orgy, but Chris pleaded ignorance and blamed wild dragon magics, whatever that was.

Now that they were in the same room, the witchy old elf didn't hesitate to magically examine him, attempting to satisfy her curiosity with various exploratory incantations even as she sparred verbally with her daughter.

Chris held his magic bottled tight down in his gut, clearly frustrating Vash, who collected only small hints at his aura. He was pleased that he seemed to hold up under such experienced scrutiny. His practice of the habit must be paying off, and not a moment too soon. He really didn't need to be handing Reyla's mother any further hints about his questionable heritage or capabilities.

Chris stayed taciturn, ignoring the probes, as that seemed to suit daughter, and vex mother. He inevitably was coaxed to tell an abbreviated, censored version of his journey; his childhood in hiding, his tumultuous awakening as a dragon, and his efforts to date trying to find a place in the magical community.

Vash was a shrewd, intelligent, and frightfully devious magical ruler, Chris knew. She wasn't buying that the magical happenings that seemed to crop up around him were innocent coincidence. She was fishing, and therefore he tried not to rise to her baiting, her insinuations, or her preposterous suggestions about how her daughter should be managing him. He let Reyla or Lillian respond for him whenever he could, stuck to his story, and heaped praise on the cooks with each new course.

Chris didn't have to act delighted when he was served a huge sous vide steak accompanied by two broiled lobster tails. If Reyla's meddling mother left with the impression that he was a food-obsessed simpleton of uncommon magical potency, he would count that a victory. Chris swore he almost had her convinced when he snagged her barely-touched portion as it was being cleared. It should be illegal to waste lobster that good after all.

But Vash was patient, tugging at frayed lies, switching tack on a dime, relentlessly belittling and provoking Reyla. Inevitably she found topics or twisted logic in ways that forced him to engage.

"Daughter, he is practically knocking up anything that breathes with a skirt, and some that don't," Vash complained with a haughty gesture toward Lillian. "His spawn will be powerful. Do you know what that means? No. Of course you don't."

"Mother, I hardly -"

"It means that once this pesky Revelation has settled down, every faction, tribe, and ambitious swamp family with half-competent leadership is going to be clamoring at your door, desperate to negotiate their spare daughters into breeding contracts. As soon as it's clear his offspring inherit some measure of his power, which they will if I am any judge of such things, you will be forced to accede to such demands lest the Synod become involved."

That caught Chris' attention, and perhaps surprisingly, not in a good way.

"Not going to happen," he rumbled, reluctantly lowering his third fork, precariously loaded with salad, seafood, sauce, and steak. He had to quash that terrifying line of thinking before it went any further. "Believe it or not, I'm just not that randy. Besides, my brood is just getting settled."

"Silly boy, I'm not talking about love, or affection," the elf patronised, clever eyes widening with delight as she found a topic to engage the stubborn young dragon. "It's just business. You won't be given offers that can be lightly refused. Everyone will want a pretty little prodigy or two, all cute and ready to grow up and shit magic crystal just like their pea-headed papa."

"No," Chris grunted, refusing to expound on any number of reasons that the frightful woman might twist against him.

"What about other dragonesses?" Vash countered, suddenly the voice of reason.

"That's different."

"Is it? You've already favoured a vampire, it's hardly fair to deprive the rest of the magical community when there is such pressing need for strong, fresh blood. And certainly not when ancient, proud dynasties are throwing piles of wealth at your feet for the privilege. That would be an excellent way to turn a lot of very powerful people against you. Tell him, daughter."

To Chris' disbelief, Reyla nodded from the opposite end of the wooden expanse.

"There will be significant pressure."

"But that's crazy," Chris frowned, mulling the implications. He really didn't like the thought of passionless entanglements for political or financial gain. He'd been purposefully ignoring the possibility since his introduction to Petra and Claire had turned out so wonderfully. He just wouldn't feel right about bringing life into the world, but having little to do with his children. Worse, how could he trust their care and education to strangers if they did indeed share some shard of his cosmos-bending power. That seemed irresponsible in the extreme. "No. I wouldn't submit to that, political expediency be damned."

"I find it simply fascinating that you think you could resist. Tell me more," coaxed the millenia old elf. "Really, it's quite unacceptable that my daughter hasn't seen fit to get a head start on the competition. Though she always was a bookish, prudish little thing. But nevermind, name your price, dragon. If Reyla won't swallow her pride and open her legs, I could arrange for one of her sisters to -"

"Shut up you ... you ... despicable old weasel!" Reyla almost screeched as she shot up, hands balled into shaking fists.

"My, my, someone is touchy," Vash chortled, carefree as ever despite Reyla's murderous gaze. She calmly plucked a piece of crumbly cheese from her salad and dropped it onto the floor, eliciting a moment of excited chittering as her clamoring pets balled the morsel. Her daughter had always hated that habit. "You are at least exercising your prerogatives as his overlord, yes? Tell me, it must be simply effortless to cast magic with young Christopher as your source? So virile, so strong and tireless. If the stories I've heard are true, it must be like sitting beneath a never-ending magical waterfall. Why, you might just be the most potent sorceress alive. Who'd have thought, my very own daughter, I'm almost proud."

"What is she going on about?" Chris whispered to Lillian from the side of his mouth. But he wasn't quiet enough, Vash's long ears caught the furtive exchange.

"What? Daughter, surely not...."

"We have not," Reyla almost growled the admission as she sat back down, knowing it would cost her somehow. "And that is enough on the subject, Mother. Things have changed in the last century, exercising some of the old practices is generally frowned upon now."

"Frowned upon? Frowned upon?!" Vash was actually incredulous. "It is frowned upon to beat my servants, but I will do it nonetheless if they have earned it. Do you expect me to believe that you have this great big magical oaf under your thumb and aren't ... using him?!"

"Hey," Chris protested half-heartedly. "The magical oaf is right here, you know."

"I don't believe it. Daughter, you've gone soft," Vash hissed, completely ignoring the dragon as she cocked an accusing finger toward her wayward daughter.

"Soft?!" Reyla laughed maniacally at her mother's ignorance, though she kept an eye on that finger. "Try me, Mother! I have grown while you lay stagnant in that filthy hovel, clinging desperately to past glories. Yet here you are, at my table, begging for my scraps. Forget that at your peril!"

Vash Narlakis' ears twitched as her daughter's words sliced deep and true. Faithful Sifone tensed at her side, hands inching toward her worn sword-hilts, ready to die for even a chance to answer such an insult. Vash sat stock still for several moments, livid, but in control.

That's when she truly saw the dragon, or more accurately, she felt him. Just for a moment, no doubt thinking he was about to be in the middle of a vicious magical crossfire, he started reaching for his power.

It was magnificent. He seemed to bulge outward against her senses, his aura pressing warm against her own.

"Chris, no!" Reyla saw it too, and the dragon stopped, but she was too late.

Vash was stunned, her daughter's insolence forgotten. Just a glimpse, but it provided such a vital perspective. Things began locking into place. Hints and facts she'd collected and discarded as exaggeration we're examined in a new light. Her daughter's absurd behaviour, the crystals. The crystals. Mental cogs jammed, then began churning like mad. She felt strange. Excitement, even fear flooded to the very root of her ancient bones.

With a victorious smile, Vash Narlakis stood, any thoughts of finishing out the meal abandoned. She had to think, and this was not the pace for it, not over such a monumental discovery. A subtle twist of the faceted gem in her left index finger, and the hive snapped back into fluid cohesion, responding to her inaudible siren's call. She strode purposefully for the door, rising and quickening as she was born along.

The dragon was watching, Vash realised, huge, steadfast, and far too innocent to wield such power. She slowed slightly, unsure what to say but knowing she couldn't just leave.

"My apologies, dragon. I have been terribly rude this evening, forgive my foolishness."

Chris glanced to Lillian, who only shrugged. She too seemed shocked by the sudden turn as the elf and her bodyguard swept by on the other side of the table.

"Scraps indeed," Vash murmured vindictively as she brushed close to her stony-faced daughter. She would never admit it, but Reyla was the best of all her many children. The most potent, independent, the brightest, and after today, certainly the most ambitious. It was deliciously scandalous and terribly obvious in hindsight, her daughter's wicked secret. Now Vash had her impetuous daughter by the short hair.

Reyla seriously considered matricide in the moments before the doors closed. It would be messy, but her secret would be safe a little while longer. But the deep thump of their shuttering tolled like a funeral bell in her mind, and the possibility faded with the moment. She put her face in her hands, biting down hard on the meat of her palm lest she scream. Control, it might be salvaged if she somehow regained control.

"Well that was weird, strange lady? Reyla, you planning on finishing those potatoes?"

***

It had been a chill night in the mountains, and the small herd of deer had sheltered in an overgrown gully higher up the slope. By the grey light of earliest morning their cautious leader, a proven buck of six summers, forged them a path down the rocky, pine-smattering slope. The does and youngsters followed, ever alert for foreign scents, shying away from the growing patches of snow and ice where they could. Warm breath misted the freezing air, and all were on guard as they approached the rushing, white-water stream and its dangerous, distracting melody. A smart predator might use the noise to cover its approach.

Flowing water was a luxury to savour before the creeks and streams iced over more completely, then there would only be snow to nibble.

The boulders and rough banks at the water's edge were already collecting drifts up to their bellies, slick and treacherous with ice from the constant splashes of the torrent's rapid descent. The small herd took turns to lower their heads, gorging themselves for the whole day.

The buck caught the odd noise in a fraction of a second, they all did. He coughed a harsh warning to his family, urging them to scatter as the echoing crack of magically rented air bounced wildly up the secluded valley. They should have been safe to winter here. It had been safe for many seasons, and humans almost never strayed this far into the mountains in the cold months.

A huge commotion reached the deers' sensitive ears from downstream, protesting rock, splashing water, and splintering deadwood. There was a powerful new scent on the breeze. It was a fearful scent, stirring ancestral terror with its distinctive, spicy musk.

Something gripped the buck, instinct mixed with fear and exhilaration. His foot stomped in the muddy snow, he barked a final command as his does' hooves clattered away over the skree and larger rocks. The old herd leader sensed that this was his moment, time to run the gauntlet. His strength, agility, and endurance would win his survival, or it would not. Either outcome would see the danger away from his mates and their offspring as he led the new threat on a merry chase. The deer snorted, and charged downstream.

Not a complete fool, the buck chose a tangential course that would eventually take him back up toward the safety of the ridges and the forested valley beyond. He couldn't see the beasts, but he could hear their great voices rumbling, hear their slithering bodies in the stream as he raced past at his closest approach.

His heart pounded, breath streaming as he ran. A deep, thrumming rhythm, a moment of immense movement in the corner of his eye, fear, and a vivid flash of lightning.

Petra banked expertly, flaring hard as her inside wingtip brushed scant metres over a stand of naked birch trees near the edge of the waterway.

Chris wondered at her self confidence to pull off such a demanding turn in the confined valley. He wouldn't have dared to try anything except to flap laboriously in place.

With a few more beats of her oversized wings, and precise deployment of her tail as counterbalance, the slender dragoness reversed course on a dime. Her strafing run was a success, and she dropped from the air onto the steaming carcass as it tumbled down the slope. Her neck darted forward, and her silver muzzle came up red.

Claire made a chirruping noise beside him, head low and bobbing as she churned her stockier body up slope over metre-tall rocks, edging toward her mother's kill.

There was a minor scuffle, a few half-hearted roars, as the kill was contested. A mouthful of Petra's static charge kept her greedy daughter away from the choicest organ meat. She might have shared that with her mate, but he was not to be distracted.

Already Chris powered his huge purple bulk upstream, hunting in his own way. If that maddened deer hadn't raced right under their noses, Petra would be at his side. But it was fascinating to watch her mate work, his angular snout held low, tongue flicking in and out. He was a brute to behold, scaled forelegs like mighty purple tree trunks, a thick, swishing tail to batter his rivals into submission. She was built to fly. He was built to plough all in his path aside, with flight as an afterthought. Her own mother would have called him a swamp-dragon, her catch-all derogatory for any of their species born without the slender mountain form so suited to the wing.

But her mother, may she rest forever peacefully, would have struggled to find fault with this magnificent male. Petra saw the moment when he caught wind of his prize, their promised reward. She watched as he tasted the water, paused, then nearly stampeded up the freezing channel, leaving the icy, crystal waters muddy in his wake.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 18|
--------------------------------------------
Claire used her mother's distraction to gobble down the buck's hind quarters, but Petra was entranced by the promise of gold, already stretching her wings to join her mate.

The lode was just where Chris remembered, but his perspective was now much different. He'd feared that someone might accidentally discover it while he was occupied with building their new home, on top of his other distractions. But his sense for that most precious metal was true, and heightened as a full dragon. It told him the deposit was safe and undisturbed since his last visit with Michelle.

In a slight bend in the gushing melt-water stream, the tip of a large granite outcropping defied the tumbling water. A pool had formed beside it due to the turbulence caused by its immovability, though it filled and emptied with loose rocks from flood to flood. Upstream, water crashed against the defiant facade, worn smooth over untold years. But slowly, water plied its inevitable force, seeping into cracks, freezing, expanding, thawing, carrying away the stone one molecule at a time if necessary.

Below the surface, a good distance into the side of the mountain, that outcrop hid a precious secret. In a natural seam, a geological junction of matter and force, a rich deposit of gold laden quartz formed a thick fissure between layers of the surrounding stone. It had likely formed there eons ago, by slow filtration of hot, mineral rich volcanic water.

Now, the waters of the stream very slowly worked down minute fissures toward the gold, seeping away slightly enriched.

To a sensitive young dragon with such a lust for the substance, that trail of dissolved ions was a natural draw. He followed it by instinct, as well as he would track any prey, tasting his way ever closer with his split tongue. Once he was nearby, he could sense it even through the solid rock. Gold felt heavy and comforting in his greater magical awareness. It was warm, as if harmonising with some vibration of his own. He'd always had a strong resonance to gold, even for a dragon, and he'd felt this deposit twice before.

He dabbled in the pool, assessing the outcrop from every angle, examining, crawling up and over the rock as his excited mates watched nearby, tails lashing.

Folk wisdom said that the best dragon gold was formed by the dragon's toil, by the excitement and emotion of clawing if from the earth by talon, tooth, and fire alone. So Chris was hesitant to involve too much magic in the process, lest it ruin the growth of his rapport with the metal. He didn't know for sure if that was true, but he wasn't willing to risk it, not without seeing what three dragons could accomplish first.

They began by exposing the outcropping, clearing the surrounding area of loose rocks, soil, and debris. It was messy, and the stream soon ran brown with dislodged silt.

They filled the pool, one tumbling boulder and kicking rear leg at a time. Petra worked to divert a portion of the stream so it wouldn't interfere. That alone took several hours, and their scales were dulled with mud long before the sun rose into the valley to set their colourful armour glinting.

Petra was a little dainty about the work, so she was tasked with the lighter, but no less important tasks. She was their lookout, assistant, and worked to help clear the leavings of the other two's digging.

Claire was like a hog in mud. Once Chris explained his plan of attack, and helped her recognise the faint feeling of the gold hidden behind tons of rock, she had to be restrained if anything. Broader of body, and more heavily muscled than her mother, she began clawing around the top of the outcrop like a manic terrier dismantling a rabbit's den. Her fire was amazing. Chris soon realised it was going to be their key to unlocking the treasure trove. She could actually melt rock with a sustained blast, and the thermal shock of her sparky gouts could shatter or loosen troublesome boulders in the freezing soil.

Chris dug and dug. He dug blindly into the muddy remnants of the pool, clawing and sometimes even biting anything that might support the huge slab of rock when they eventually made their play to topple it. He did the brunt of the dirtiest, hardest lifting. His white talons widened fissures, then he yanked backward, sometimes pulling away hundreds of pounds of dirt and stone at a time. His own jets of vivid plasma were useful to dry slippery rocks or widen grips, but they didn't have the kick of Claire's roaring inferno.

It was late afternoon before they even exposed the vital fissure that led down to the lode. Petra had caught them several more deer and two mountain goats to fuel their labour. A tired but positive attitude was shared between the trio as they surveyed the diverted water and the huge plateau of their tailings below the now denuded outcropping.

It was tempting to see if Claire could melt her way straight down to the gold, but Chris knew that wouldn't really help them get it out. Instead, he directed her to begin gouging and melting shallow holes at intervals along the top of the exposed fissure.

He began working on the vital fissure at the side of the huge chunk. Petra meanwhile, got a crash course in amateur lumbering. She eventually figured out how to fell a few unlucky fur trees, roughly trimmed them, and began dragging them proudly down to the worksite. She hurt one of her hind legs on the treacherous footing, but the injury was thankfully minor.

Slipping and sliding on the churned-up mountainside, pieces of log were snapped, sworn at, burnt, and even pulverised as the dragons hoisted them upright, then wedged them into the prepared depressions along the top of the crack that housed the lode. It was a painstaking, slow process. Logs had to be thinned, shortened, and sometimes discarded. The holes had to be widened, and the pivotal one on the side was deepened substantially when it was realised it wouldn't adequately bite the selected log on it's own. The sun had set again, and Claire was all out of fire before everything was in place to Chris' satisfaction. Everyone was exhausted and cold.

He was very tempted to give in and use one of his orbs to gouge out chunks of the offending outcropping until it was a fine rubble. Draconic stubbornness wouldn't allow him to admit defeat until his plan had failed more thoroughly, and besides, the gold below practically shouted to his senses now. Petra could barely contain herself, dogging his footsteps impatiently, nipping friskily at his haunches.

Finally they were ready, and the first true blows were struck in earnest.

Chris' tail slammed down on the log with tremendous force, driving it fractionally deeper as painful ripples shot up his body. The end of his tail was mostly hardened bone, and spiked for combat. Besides him, Claire used her battered forepaws, raising her entire body high on her hind quarters before punching down on her log with pulverising force. Petra heaved and pushed on the fulcrum point below. She even attempted a few shoulder-charges down a hastily constructed ramp before that was decided to be better suited to those with thicker skulls and emptier tummies.

It was bone-jarring work, even for dragons. Several log sections along the top gave out, snapped, or just started falling apart. But it was working, they were slowly creating pressure, wedging the rock apart along natural lines of stress and weakness. One particular blow finally widened the fissure by almost an inch. With a tortured groan, the very mountainside seemed to tremble beneath them, and the air was suddenly laden with the metallic tang of their prize.

Once things settled, Chris was quick to encourage his mates into another round of repositioning and trunk pounding, taking up the extra space they had won, building pressure all over again.

It seemed achievable now, and once the fissure was again wedged as tightly as their increasingly tender muscles would allow, all three dragons went below. In the darkness and mud and rubble, they heaved and strained in unison. Their legs churned, pushing on the end of the biggest, longest log they could find to fit in the confined stream bed. Over half of Chris' earthworks had been to allow the creation of this lever. Braced against the mountain, with the might of three dragons and Archimedes himself arrayed against it, the rock finally split.

Dragons scampered like frightened kittens when it toppled, snorting and chirping triumphantly. It creaked as the lever gave, then slid suddenly. The outcrop seemed to hold for a moment before crashing down onto the muddy water with a tremendous slap. They would have been fine where they were, but the sane reaction was to get the hell out of the way, dragon or not. Claire roared down at it from the top of their temporary dam.

Chris slithered excitedly back to the sheared face as soon as things settled. Petra and Claire were right beside him, pushing in their eagerness. Between the end of the huge, displaced rock chunk, amongst their logs now scattered about like toothpicks, their prize glittered in the starlight. It was indeed a large seam of gold-bearing quartz, a mixture of ruddy metal and whitish stone. Heavy on the gold, light on the quartz too, if he was any judge.

Impatient for her turn to gawk in the limited space, Claire set fire to the tumble of broken logs, and the true extent of their illicit excavation was laid bare. Petra actually gasped, a rather strange expression on a dragon.

There was a lot of gold, hundreds and hundreds of kilograms. There could be more, depending on how deep the vein ran, and its purity. Chris shuffled forward, leaning through the harmless flame to rest his forehead against the precious substance.

There was a reason they were drained. There, in the gold, was magical potential. Waiting, energy absorbed during the day as he and Claire and Petra plied their mighty bodies toward its liberation, it resonated back at them now. He pushed, and his magic poured effortlessly inside, finding the most welcoming of homes between the matrix of its malleable atomic structure. Transfer was seamless, there was no resistance or loss, no fighting his intent. It wasn't anything to do with his unique Ether abilities, or his godlike patron, Chris realised. This wonder, this miracle of magic was all dragon, the wild magic of their species.

With it alone, he might change the world.

Chris shrank back, letting Petra and Claire have their turn to nuzzle at the vein like catnip.

He was stunned, floored not only that they had triumphed in their base, muddy efforts, but at the possibilities now opening to him. There was plenty of work still to do, experiments, prototypes to build and test. It was incredible.

With Immi, he might make an army's worth of near invincible armour, or fantastic magical constructs. With Hailey, he might revolutionise the energy market, space exploration, and who knew what else. With Reyla, he might do any number of things, including creating weapons of terrible potency, or unleash magics not seen for thousands of years.

With Claire and Petra, he would make a family, and redouble their crystal production. That at least would be a humble start, and one free of guilt.

Yes, Chris decided more forcefully, conviction reaffirmed. For despite the wonders this new trove of dragon gold foreshadowed, he would have to live with the consequences of his scheming and inventing. Previously ideas, these things were now possibilities, and soon to be realities. There was one less step to take, and correspondingly, that much less room to turn back.

Once the big chunks of gold-imbued quartz were pried loose and transported back to Denver by orb, the dragonesses found use for the old warehouse disguising their new underground home. His mates worked on and off for days to crush the rock and separate the magically imbued metal. It was quite the spectacle, two dragons crunching stone under their giant paws. Their swelling tummies were starting to scrape as they lumbered about on the big concrete floor and Chris found that intensely adorable.

Kyle came by to help the process at Chris' invitation, a little overawed by the honour. The rest of the brood looked on in detached fascination for days, and there were plenty of good natured eye-rolls about treasure obsessed dragons.

It took the dwarven smith time to warm up, and he tread as lightly as a mouse around two hungry cats while Petra and Claire were at work. He ended up re-assembling his own furnace on site to help melt and process impurities from the metal, which saved Claire burning the warehouse down with her own attempts. He absolutely refused the idea to have it transported to his shop, and rightly so for security reasons.

But not only did he sift and smelt out the gold, Kyle employed advanced metallurgical techniques to ring every ounce of gold from the tailings. Watching him gave Chris a broader appreciation of Reyla's efforts to collect useful pieces for her magical kingdom.

He himself wouldn't have the confidence or expertise to handle mercury and caustic agents, let alone know how to acquire, store, or dispose of them responsibly. Expertise was a type of power all of its own, and Chris was realising that he must transition his mindset if he was going to play on the same stage as the magical or even mundane elite. Beyond the more obvious tropes, wealth, institutional power, knowledge, trade, or even magic, the capability to do things like process gold from rock was, in its way, a type of power.

Reyla liked to tie useful people to her purpose, indeed that was the essence of the magical microcosm hiding under the city.

Chris appreciated the ways that he was slowly being tied into the elf's web too. It wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but more and more of her growing power was riding on his shoulders. He shouldn't lightly forget that.

Lillian had benefited from her blood pact, by the equivalent of several centuries. Reyla had helped entrain her telekinesis too. If that relationship had soured over the centuries, it had still been mutually beneficial. They even seemed more cordial these days, now that Reyla's vice like hold on the vampire had loosened and some of their dirty laundry had aired.

But would he be content to be part of someone else's web. Could he be content as a piece on her board rather than a true player? Chris wasn't sure, but he felt the elf's strings pulling tighter around him. Especially after her latest rescue and that downright strange dinner with her mother.

There was a seductive comfort in following orders, in having a defined purpose and letting someone else guide his course. He sort of liked that about his work with Michelle and her team. There was plenty of leeway, but he was ultimately following someone else's lead.

Without Reyla's sheltering wing, he would be loaded with added stresses and responsibilities. The magical community was so tiny, living outside of her authority would almost be like stepping outside of civilisation, and all its nice trappings. Sure, other powerful figures would climb over each other to extend the dragon and his brood their welcome, but that new hand would come with its own conditions.

He had to consider these ideas, because with this gold, he was going to attempt things that would compromise any illusion that Reyla truly had him under her thumb. She'd nearly begged him to lay low for the Synod, to keep his head down for a few decades and let the existing powers of the Being hierarchy adjust to his sudden appearance in their midst.

She feared the consequences of exposing his secret, or the extent of his abilities. Yet he was starting to realise that there would be a whole other boatload of consequences, just by following her advice.

Other things worried him above and beyond upset fairies and dynasty-obsessed elves. He had an asshole of a celestial patron breathing down his neck at any moment. There was that nagging sense again, that he was going to have to be the one to step up and deal with Radek, personally.

At some point, there wouldn't be any hiding his unique powers. Being dishonest about his origins in the meantime, even by omission, might be worse in the long run, he just didn't know. No doubt Reyla would say he was being terribly naive, but he wanted to be honest.

As Chris watched a batch of their magically potent rough gold being prepared for processing, he was forced to confront these disconcerting options. He had power, immense power. He could do incredible, even terrible things if he marshalled his resources and his resolve. But should he, and what gave him the right?

He had to talk to Reyla, after this first experiment anyway.

"What's got you so moody? Hmm?" Petra laced her silver-scaled fingers over his as she embraced him from behind. In her half-dragon form, she was fresh from sweeping up the pounded quartz under Claire's paws and running it through a small sluice box they had purchased for the task.

Her hands were icy, and she tortured him mercilessly by running her clawed fingers carefully across his tummy until he was squirming, breathless, and grinning. With her as half-dragon in baggy overalls, and him as a mere bulky human in clothes he didn't want to ruin, he was entirely at her mercy.

He also knew better than to escalate with a playful dragoness unless he was committed. After a mentally punishing afternoon in the library, he wasn't prepared to start a Godzilla-style brawl in the cold, industrial backstreets of Denver. Taxpayer-funded magical protections or not, that didn't count as laying low in anyone's books.

"Mercy, please," he wheezed, catching her offending digits and trying to hold them still. "I was just being gloomy about all the trouble I'm likely to cause if I actually do anything ground-breaking with this gold."

That seemed to sober his mate, because she was thoughtful for long moments as they watched the powerfully-built dwarf tinker with his furnace and moulding tools whilst muttering about his latest beard singe.

"Well I know Hailey is mad to get her hands on some. I don't pretend to understand everything she has planned with you, but I specifically recall a promise about a bed made of gold. Who's going to complain about that? Who'd ever know unless you told them?"

"You have a point there," Chris rumbled, feeling his mood lightening just by confiding in his lover. "And I did promise something special for the grotto, didn't I? Actually I was just thinking the same thing earlier today, it will be an excellent first try. I'm excited to see how our magical harmony with the stuff will allow us to exert control over it. I've been researching all sorts of spells to alter just fundamental things like physical properties. Adhesion, malleability, hardness, conductivity..."

"It's sexy when you get all intent on something," the dragonesses huffed, moving to stand in front of him but doing so without releasing her embrace. He was warm from his walk home though, and she enjoyed his close warmth. "Go on."

"Okay. Gold is really heavy, right? Therefore we don't have that much by volume. I'm hoping we can form some sort of semi-fluid aggregate to make up for that, with the right magical prodding that is. Diamond is the obvious candidate. It's an adequate magical reservoir, it's really hard, and best of all I can make the stuff by the truckload with my spooky powers."

Petra was clearly intrigued by the idea, but a cute frown creased her forehead even as her nostrils flared with treasure induced arousal.

"You want to make me a magical concrete bed of gold and diamonds? Don't get me wrong, it's bold, it's crazy, I like it. But why? Couldn't I just have a great big pile of it all instead? That sounds much easier. I could lie on top of it and run my fingers through it."

"All valid to the discerning dragoness I'm sure. However, we're after emergent properties, my dear," Chris coaxed with a chuckle. His hands were naturally straying toward her sumptuous hips. He couldn't help thinking about what they would be doing on this theoretical lump of a bed. "If we can make this work the way I envision, it will provide a far superior, if indirect method of transferring magic into gemstones. We'll exploit the connection to our gold. It will act as a conduit, and a reservoir. The diamonds will ultimately be extruded and sold ... at a reasonable markup. Perhaps we replace them in batches? I'm not sure. There's potentially so much more it could do, too. I have an idea for a magical drill, actually. Besides, it'll be softer than a pile of gold bars when I'm nailing your sweet ass to it."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 19|
--------------------------------------------
"I do like that last one. But you want to make gold ... soft?" If anything, her frown had grown, but her subtly swaying hips and restless wings gave Petra's lusty nature away. She touched the gold pendant at her neck. "That all sounds intriguing, and we could use any help with the backlog of crystals."

"Soft, hot, bouncy, self-sustaining golden fluffy handcuffs, I'll do it all. I want to play with it like playdough, Petra. Magic, it's ... I need to see what I can do," Chris tried to convey his desire to push some boundaries, to make his magical mark beyond his established reputation as a magical golden goose. He wanted to see what was possible just for the sake of knowing, and the chance of discovering something incredible. "This is probably blasphemous, so don't tell any strange dragons or it will kill my good reputation, but there's no point in having all this wonderful gold, this wealth, if we don't do anything productive with it. Our connection is just so intrinsic. The potential magical uses are mind blowing when you start to think about it. Actually I can't believe I ever sold any to Reyla, that was pretty dumb even if I did need the cash at the time."

"I adore your enthusiasm, my love." Petra kissed his chin, looking up at him with earnest devotion. "I was born a long time ago, in a less enlightened era. I know that's no excuse for ignorance, but in a way I'm still a simple dragon with simple desires, a simple woman if there is any such thing."

Chris shook his head in denial at that, but she placed a finger on his lips and continued.

"I don't understand the greater implications of making gold soft, bouncy, and especially not neutron-absorbent. But I'm glad you do, Chris, and I'm glad you're passionate. So build me a fancy, world-bending golden bed, and experiment to your heart's content. Responsibly," She added the caveat with a knowing smile. "I think that's incredible, but I'll leave it to you and Hailey. I'm old, I fully intend to enjoy my simpler life and focus on raising our children."

"There's nothing wrong with that," Chris nodded. "I admire you for it actually."

"Good. Just stay off the evening news with your experiments this time, please."

"I'll try," Chris winced apologetically at the memory of the fateful moon incident. "Hey, want to find out how a hidebound dwarf journeyman reacts to us making a mere bed out of invaluable dragon gold? I think he might finally lose it with me."

"That would be fun. I feel terrible but he's almost cute, he jumps like a little bunny when my paws come close. Of course it's a different story when they're heavily armoured and arrayed against you in well disciplined shield ranks. They fight like little devils and they're brave."

"The voice of experience?" Chris asked as they broke their embrace, his eyebrows cocked in mild surprise.

"A bit," Petra admitted. "When I was just a girl, younger than Claire is now. The moral of the story is, their armour conducts, so they roast like popcorn against my lighting. However their scorpion platforms hurt, and they're fast. They've probably got their hands on guns now."

"That's ... interesting. After hearing about Reyla in action, I'm starting to appreciate the brutality of magical wars in our past. Long life seems a daunting prospect in some ways."

"In truth, there haven't been any magical conflicts besides a few skirmishes since before I was born," Petra admitted, softening her voice as they approached Kyle and the radiating heat of his efforts. "Don't tell him about it, okay? It's not polite."

Chris nodded, then raised his voice to call out to both the smith and the ruby dragoness clawing and crushing the last of their captured lode further down the floor.

"Guys, come over please! I've just come from Reyla's library and I think we're ready to try something a little crazy."

"You dragons leave me out of this scheme," Kyle looked up, removing his goggles and squinting his eyes open and closed a few times as he approached. He had a terrible case of racoon rings. Claire scampered over too, curling her tail under the gas powered forge to bask in its warmth.

"It's time you got a lesson in how dragons forge," Chris blustered good-natured, watching the dwarf shake his head in resignation. "Don't worry, I took your advice about simplicity to heart. This will be interesting, but no component is groundbreaking."

"Oh there's nothing groundbreaking about almost half a ton of weapons-grade gold in the hands of a ballsy, headstrong young dragon, nothing at all," the pearly, wide smile emerging from the smith's beard told Chris that the dwarf was game, despite his pessimism. "This might earn my name a place on the Great Spire. Though it's good odds for the seventh face, the face for remembering our great idiots. I reserve the right to say I told you so."

"A favourite saying of dwarves," Petra smirked.

"Aye, because we're usually right."

Chris was already working on the parameters of the Ether orb he would use.

Every school of magic had its limitations and shortcomings, especially for a rank amatuer like himself. Incantations, for example, were almost always short-lived unless they were cast specifically on an object with a dedicated source. Tied to the propagation of sound, the practitioner's voice, their intention, was manifested through the tool of language. Incantation was a good choice to cast broad-ranging spells on relatively short notice. However, they took a good chunk of focus to pull off, and they could be interrupted in a number of ways.

Runes were just slow. Excellent longevity, but very focused on craft and preparation rather than in-the-moment casting. As Chris had discovered, complexity had it's pitfalls too. Immi's prototype devices guzzled magic just monitoring the immediate surroundings for magical threats.

Dragon gold was special, and he was finally playing to his strengths.

In theory, almost anything at all could be done with magic. It is said to be the power of creation itself. A rock that floats, a duck that sinks, or an ever-filling pizza box. With the right spell, runes, or even a powerfully focused thought, these were all possible. The drawback was the cost. Those fresh pizzas had to come from somewhere. Newton had a thing or two to say about that rock, and he charged by the Planck. Good luck to anyone trying to form the pizza from scratch rather than magically stealing it from the warmer of the nearest pizza joint.

Good, practical magic is about finding the most inventive, cheapest way of accomplishing the goal with minimal compromises. People are frugal when they're using a truly precious resource.

To dragons, their gold was a magical sponge and putty in one. Chris suspected that once he put in a little work to unlock its secrets, it might hold his magical impressions almost indefinitely. It had its own magical field, and it was highly conductive, magically speaking. It vacuumed up excess arcane energy in the presence of dragons, and would bleed it off very slowly by remarkable self-replication. His spells should stick to it like superglue. As long as he was only modifying, not creating or destroying anything, any magic cast on the gold itself should be extremely efficient.

Like electricity in a superconductor, Chris thought excitedly.

He tested the theory by picking up a still-warm ounce bar from Kyle's trolly. As always, it was satisfyingly heavy, and a shiver of magical recognition ran up his spine on contact, nibbling his nerves. It glinted richly, even though the light outside was fading into evening. Indeed, the gold was calling out to be put to use. Chris centered his thoughts inward, gathering focus, blanking out everything except himself and that wonderfully hefty golden rectangle. A modest trickle of power, and his intent surged toward the metal structure inside. His mind quested, searching with singular desire.

Bounce.

The request was met with parade-day enthusiasm. Chris just knew that the bar would comply like the finest India rubber, but continued his contact and deepened his immersion.

He didn't think the atoms of gold themselves would change, but there must be subtle shifts in the way they aligned. Rather, the energy he spent created new magically defined patterns of memory and least resistance, almost like artificial polymers. Chris took a moment to appreciate the bizarre potential of magic applied at the smallest physical scales, he had been thinking on the topic for weeks. Mundane and magical research now paid off, for with a deeper understanding, manipulation at an atomic level seemed almost basic.

The positively charged metal lattice had just obeyed his will, and their dissociated electrons followed because they had little choice to do otherwise. It was simply incredible. If not groundbreaking, then to an amatuer like himself, certainly mind-opening.

The spell he'd been inspired by professed to absorb kinetic energy with profound efficiency, rebounding it almost violently in proportion. It cost. Indeed, it might have been prohibitive with a rock or a lump of iron. Dragon infused gold however, leapt toward his desire, and held his mental construct almost effortlessly.

Chris smiled as he withdrew, opening his eyes again to see the others watching him expectedly. In his fingers, the small gold block gave under a little squeeze, almost squirming. It was much firmer than a ball of rubber bands, but it did squish slightly and spring back in a decidedly non-metallic fashion.

So, the books he'd poured over in Reyla's library were correct, even though he'd used intention rather than incantation.

There really wasn't much power in the spell at all, by his standards at least. When he dropped it, eliciting a startled response, the deceptively heavy bar jolted back into the air like a coiled spring set free.

He felt like whooping, then laughed aloud as the gold skittered off at an odd angle to the concrete floor. The damn thing wasn't rounded at all.

Claire nearly toppled them all as her angular, ruby-scaled head darted forward to snap at it. But the second bounce was even crazier than the first, and the momentum was being conserved nicely. Her jaws clacked loudly on empty air, scant centimeters off her elusive target. She chased after it delightedly, completely heedless with wings half raised, batting at the shiny thing down the length of the warehouse. Chris was grinning like a fool, watching her pregnant belly scrape the floor as she chittered a dragon's joyous laugh.

Kyle rubbed at his eyes in humorous resignation.

"I think we'll keep that one for the kids," Petra observed with newfound fascination. The dragoness fished out her own heavy pendant, examining it with new respect. "Could you make it powerfully charged, electricity-wise?"

"I don't see why not, at least in theory. Though that does sound sort of dangerous," Chris ventured.

"Dragons," The dwarf muttered under his breath, looking almost paternally at the stack of ingots he'd lovingly laboured over. Their fate wasn't his own to choose, but clearly he disapproved of them being squandered on whimsy.

"Have a little faith, that was just a wee trial run," Chris teased, summoning a large Ether orb into existence above them with a dramatic unfurling of his hand. It loomed, dark and sinistrous, about a metre and a half wide. "See this bubble? I've told it to hold only gold for now, it's quite safe otherwise. If you'd please toss about half of the bars in there while I go collect the diamonds, we'll get down to something really interesting."

Chris headed downstairs as Claire began loping back to see what they were doing.

Petra looked about, and seeing that no one else would dare, began chucking gold distrustfully at the devouring magical sphere. Her precious treasure vanished wherever it touched the geometrically perfect black surface and somehow, it didn't fall back down.

Kyle watched from the sidelines with arms crossed, then with a gruff rubble, turned to close up his forge for the day.

Immi dogged his heels from the kitchen as Chris went first to change into something more practical. He was about to do some dragon work, so he only put on loose, comfortable clothes and some woolly slippers Annabel insisted on buying for him. He'd protested their purchase, but secretly loved the things, especially for getting up to pee in the night. He felt casually confident, buoyed by his initial proof of concept.

The diamond manufactory had been moved out of the grotto the very day after they moved in. That was for the best, because it was now much expanded in a corner of the large communal area at the start of the two bedroom hallways. The space was still undecided, and now that construction was finished it was a much better place for the task. Neat heaps of uncut gemstones glittered duly below a cubic array of his tiny black orbs. They now produced thousands of sand-like diamond granules whenever he cycled them. A range of larger sizes were being produced too, up to about the dimensions of a small hen's egg, with several grades in between.

With neat mounds of near-worthless carbon piled up like that, the corner of the large room looked a little like the landscaping supply yard that had taken all the crushed rock from excavating the house. Completely out of place beside the various piles of cardboard boxes, packaging, and other moving flotsam that had naturally, though hopefully temporarily encroached on the unclaimed area.

At a loss for a better idea how to get them upstairs, Chris retrieved hand brushes and dust-shovels from the utility closet. He and Immi set to scooping them up into a series of mid-sized orbs, which were then guided carefully back through the house in convoy, the sprite prancing in the lead. That potential utility alone boggled Chris, and he reminded himself to experiment more thoroughly with just his transportation capacity. It was going to be critical to know how much he could carry, and how quickly it tired him.

Dragon, sprite, and bobbing extra-dimensional spheres must have made a strange procession, because Michelle and Annabel couldn't resist following them back out through the draconic entrance. They put on warm coats and headed upstairs to see what all the hubbub was for.

Chris stripped, transformed, and made the main orb somewhat transparent so the others could see. Only he had the true, unerring sense of everything that went on inside, his audience didn't feel the absence of air, or the teeming billions of heavy nuclei and fuzzy electrons. As he prepared himself to focus and cast magic once again, he made a few more adjustments, groundwork for the addition of gemstones. This would be the most demanding use of one of his orbs since his qualified success with Hailey, and so he planned carefully and double checked his desired parameters for safety and solidity of logic and purpose. He was tempted to send the others away in case there was a mishap, but he suspected his broodmates would balk. That was quite comforting in a way.

Satisfied, the diamonds were dumped unceremoniously in with the gold from above. Once again, the orb's slightly distorted outline allowed passage inward but then perfectly contained, allowing everything outward across its membrane excepting carbon and gold. Only light was enabled to travel in both directions at the moment.

The hoarded diamonds bolstered a much larger pile on the bottom of the sphere so that barely a trace of the gold was visible, even though there was a pharaoh's ransom worth of the precious stuff inside.

With a swollen audience, three dragons, fire red, cloud silver, and royal purple, unleashed their combined breath at the main orb. With three violent torrents spewing heat and magic inside, the gold soon softened.

Immi clapped excitedly as Chris padded forward to adjust the main orb once more. It wasn't quite right, so he ordered that it roll very slowly. The glittering pile clung high on the rising side, then slumped in a rush and began to mix and tumble. Satisfied that the immense heat was absorbing more evenly, Chris resumed his vivid plasma breath.

In his mind's eye, diamond sparkled, churning like a choppy sea. Gold bars glimmered, rich and almost red as they surfaced, only to subsume moments later as undeniable mass dragged them back down toward the bottom. He intimately experienced the first molten trickles of liquid gold, molecules too excited to maintain true cohesion with the larger metallic lattice. They touched cooler diamonds, hardening instantly back into a messy clump. Then, like chocolate in a water bath, the rest started to liquify all at once.

Petra's actinic breath gave out, providing a gap in the near-blinding flow of dragon fire. Michelle exclaimed, and the others rushed to reposition, watching molten gold begin to churn and splatter goopily as it ran down the rolling sides of its otherworldly container.

Chris sensed the excited vibrations of the atoms inside, they had poured in an immense deluge of heat. Under natural circumstances it would probably take days to cool. He stopped his own breath and Claire followed suit a few moments later. Everyone watched as more gold became liquid and the mixture began to settle into a clumpy roll, much like a batch of fresh concrete. In minutes, and with a few more blasts from the weary dragons, it was mixed thoroughly. A thick, sludgy aggregate of diamonds suspended and lubricated in molten gold.

His spells were simple, and yet profound when blessed with a conduit so excellent as dragon gold.

First he imprinted a moderate magical attraction between the gold and everything it was currently touching. That was only diamond, for the orb had all but evacuated itself of everything else under the heat and pressure. But the effect of that first magic was instant and dramatic. The rich mixture stood up, taking on a new texture inside its container. Suddenly it was behaving more like a glutinous dough than a hot pile of rocks with expensive sauce drizzled on top. It tumbled up the side of the orb in a cohesive blob, then fell to the bottom and began rolling around and around. He would fiddle with the exact strength of that binding later, it didn't have to be exact for now.

Piggy-backed on that magical impression, Chris refocused and added that the gold should very gently repel everything else. He didn't want something or someone falling in, never to surface. That would hopefully prevent him being poked by the tines of one of Claire's errant phone chargers. The woman had many and they tended to be continually lost, then found again in wholly improbable places. Chris paid close attention as the spell took, trickling magic in over long minutes, maintaining as single-minded a focus as he could.

He slowed the orb's roll, and as before, gave the gold a magical bounce factor. The diamond aggregate would actively work against that, so he made it quite strong for now. There were bright flashes and actinic sparks as the spell propagated, delighting his audience. Whole fistfulls of the golden clump shattered off, crashing violently against the walls of its prison. There were magical imbalances, but after a sort of hierarchical shift where Chris put the new spell at higher precedence over the others, it gradually settled.

Chris doubted he could have pulled this idea off without his Ether orb. Not only did it eliminate the need for an industrial-sized crucible, it gave him complete awareness of what was going on inside. It was beautiful. He could feel exactly how the gold pulled together, how the progressively smaller diamonds flowed over and around one another. He'd hoped that it would be self-suspending, at least in the medium term, and it looked like he would succeed there. It was fascinating, and triggered a series of follow up ideas that he would have to try later if he ever found the time.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 20|
--------------------------------------------
Finally, he locked the gold in a liquid phase and increased its surface tension. That was by far the trickiest and most expensive magic to imprint on the now-jiggly golden blob. It's hard to accurately imagine surface tension, and as soon as the gold started cooling, it would cost energy to keep it magically fluid at room temperature. But given its mighty, if currently untested magical capacity, Chris hoped it wouldn't be an insurmountable problem.

All that was left to do now was let it cool, install it in the grotto, and give Petra the boning of her lifetime as they broke it in. He could already picture himself nibbling her shoulders, her tummy pressed to the extravagant golden surface as he rocked into her warm, slippery, vagina from behind. He suspected her orgasms would be something special to behold.

When he eventually withdrew his awareness from the orb, he found his dragon body stiff and exhausted. Petra and Claire were warm against his flanks, cuddled close to conserve heat and keep him company in the freezing air. One of Petra's great wings blanketed their haunches like a tent.

It was fully dark outside and his questing tongue told him that the others had gone elsewhere a good while ago. Outside it was snowing again, crisp and cold and quite in the alpine air. Winter was truly amongst them now.

His dragonesses roused with his stirring. They shared a loving nuzzle, necks twinning gently.

"I must have become entranced, I was watching the gold very closely," he rumbled apologetically in the deep sibilance of his dragon voice.

"It's good to know you're not immune, Sire," Petra gave the side of his jaw an affectionate nip before licking it better. Her tail swished suggestively against his own.

"Are you tired? You've been working on it for hours, Chris, just staring and pouring magic into that ... that...," Claire trailed off, then hissed a throaty chuckle. "What are we calling that marvelous thing anyway?"

"It's yours now, you name it," Chris deferred, butting snouts with first red, then silver. His love for both swelled in his chest, a warm frisson tickled his thick neck scales, then translated all the way down his spine in a shiver to the bony tip of his tail. A deeper contentment stirred too, something down at the very core of him. Their kids would have the opportunity to grow up with this magic, with caring dragon mothers and a father that might have some idea what he was doing by the time they were his age. "I just wanted to do the best I could for you."

Robert Falconer looked up from the latest of many, many dossiers he'd been tasked to read that evening.

Sometimes it felt like he was a comically undersized dog walker. There were so many leashes grasped in his hands, and he was being towed down the sidewalk by his runaway, barking charges. It was hard to think straight with so many political interests tugging him in every direction, all clamouring for his attention. You just couldn't keep everyone happy, and most everyone he dealt with seemed to be a selfish asshole in their heart of hearts.

One of his many aids was knocking on the doorframe, Sarah, a document clutched triumphantly in her other hand. That one was going to go far, competent, ambitious, three-quarters immune to her own idealism.

"We did it!" She lifted the document high, the United Nations logo emblazoned boldly on the front page. "They're bringing it up by three weeks! There was going to be some random security summit, but Germany, China, and Canada all agreed, and then everyone else who mattered started getting on-board. We'll get fewer heads of state, but we should get most of the workhorses."

"Sarah, you're a genius. I don't believe it, that's amazing!" Robert was genuinely impressed, she'd wrangled the critical pre-Revelation signing three whole weeks up the schedule. "Three whole weeks. This is huge, it will force an end to the interminable pecking over minor details. Thank you."

"You're welcome," the young woman's enthusiasm tempered with a little embarrassment as the President got up and shook her hand.

"What's your poison?" Robert asked, gesturing over to an ornate cherry side table where crystal tumblers and an array of decanters stood at the ready. "This is worth celebrating."

"I'll have the nastiest, oakiest whisky you've got, sir. Neat, of course."

The President smiled broadly, his eyebrow raised slightly in appraisal. He chuckled to himself as he went over and poured a finger for each of them, the pungent scent of grain spirits leaking into the air.

"You really will go far, Sarah. Cheers, and well done."

"You must help me understand, Mr. Baryst."

Sand trickled and scrunched around their ankles, Hailey fidgeted and Chris could barely resist the impulse. It was hot to the touch. The sun beat unapologetically down from above, cooking the desert and the strange visitors from America.

"My people have little trust in the promises of foreigners any more."

The white and blue robed leader spoke in halting English. The pepper-haired elder was barely even sweating, though the posse of younger men who followed him everywhere, avidly listening, had the sense to congregate in the shadows of their hardy white vehicles.

"Understandable," Chris nodded, respectful of the older man's wary nature. The compounding injustices heaped upon his people wouldn't allow for anything else. Just the cultural damage these people had endured would cripple them for decades to come, maybe longer. Yet here he was, and wondering if he wasn't just repeating the exploitative cycle. He looked to Hailey beside him, judging that she was content to let him do the talking. She was nervous with the import of the moment, uncomfortable with the open leering by the elder's entourage. It would fall on his shoulders to make the offer. "How can I help you understand our proposal?"

"What are you getting out of this, big-man?" The elder liked to point out his size, he'd even offered Chris a mock wrestle when they'd first met. That reminded him fondly of Jethry. "This land has one thing left of value. I do not see your tanks, American. Where is the mighty army to take it back in the name of freedom?"

A dark, wiry arm shot out from his loose garment. The gesture encompassed the bleached-ochre dunes, the parched, rocky flats of a massive, ancient lakebed. The trail of a long-dead river snaked away in the distance, past the mining operation. The riverbed twisted back toward the sea, between short, spike-tipped hills whose slopes would be lucky to grow lichen.

Chris sighed, he'd been hoping his nationality wasn't going to come up again. But he could understand why it did, he was treading on pre-salted earth.

"I am not affiliated with the government of the United States in this matter," Chris reiterated for what felt like at least the fifth time. "This is a private, informal arrangement, a delicate arrangement. You're not exactly standing on firm political feet either you know. But okay, what I get out of this is a quiet little part of the planet, a place where I can progress our experiments in relative peace. I consider it a place to show the world what might be done with magic. Your people's situation, and your own blessing, will give me a moral high-ground to stand on if anyone objects. And make no mistake, someone will object. If you don't like the sound of that, just say so."

"And you would just give it back to us, our land?" The leader's eyes narrowed, his skin crinkling dryly at the corners of a face so lean as to be gaunt. "You would make the river flow and the desert bloom? You would support our claim of independence? Bah, I have seen magic. Our people know of witches, of shape-changers and water-finders. It is all tricks, small things, the healing of goats and the finding of lost cattle."

"You haven't seen magic like this," Chris promised softly, his patience was starting to erode under the baking sun. He looked out on the desolate landscape, almost resigning to give up and look for somewhere else to use as a proving ground for Hailey's ideas. This place was perfect though, so barren. Even the people were broken and in need of help, if they could be persuaded to take it. "I want to help you. I will reshape this place, your people will have electricity, clean water. You will be able to grow crops again, to fish in the lake. There will be tourists, roads, and eventually infrastructure. You can form your own government, educate your children, and if you decide I should leave, I will. What will it take? How can I earn your trust?"

"Shut it down."

Through the rising heat-haze, heavy machinery kicked up dust as piles and piles of whitish, phosphate-rich dirt were drawn up from the earth, ready for a long conveyor trip to port.

"That fucking mine!" Chris growled, barely stopping himself from throwing his hands up in frustration. "You know that's not an option. The Moroccans will start another war over it. I never thought I'd see people killing each other over ancient bird shit. Listen, forget the damn mine for a moment and think about your people. I can help you, help defend your claim to this land with a good conscience. But I will not initiate a conflict, however justified it might seem to you. If I was prepared to do that, we wouldn't be having this conversation."

"What do you mean?" The elder asked.

"If I was prepared to conquer, to start a war with the Moroccans over this piece of desert, then there would be no need to ask your permission to use the land afterwards, would there? I would just take it."

"I suppose that is true."

"So what is your answer then?"

The man surveyed the desolate landscape for a long moment, frowning, as if seeking advice in the low dunes and the merciless heat of the near-equatorial sun.

"What choice do I have?"

Chris sighed, all his frustration alloying into sour guilt. He couldn't imagine the hardships this old guy had battled with, his people disowned, beaten, rounded-up in camps, and ignored by most of the world to this day. He shouldn't be strong-arming their representative into this weighty decision, but it truly would be to their benefit.

"None, not really. I'm sorry. I know it must be hard, but put aside the past for a second, think of your future. Your children are growing up in tents and tin shacks, they aren't taught your culture, and few survive to adulthood. In a few generations you won't even exist as a people. More fighting is not going to solve that."

"At your age I would have disagreed ... no. But, it hurts, dragon," the man swung a gnarled hand onto his chest, a clawing first in the sweat-stained cotton. "My heart is still full of a young man's anger! But you are right, my head knows that you are right. Help us. Yes, help us and you will have my blessing."

Hailey clapped excitedly at the good news, then half-hid behind him as she drew leering attention. Chris squeezed her hand and smiled, so she finally spoke up.

"It would be our pleasure," she started a little too eagerly and reigned herself back in. "It will still be months before we can think about breaking ground, but I've been looking over satellite images and I've drawn up some initial ideas for you to look at. I'll send them to your email. I need feedback, so now's the time to voice your concerns because once the engineering is finalised, we're dealing with some fine margins."

***

"You've been remarkably busy," Reyla spoke with only a little acid in her tone as she preceded Chris down the arched hallway, not even glancing back over her shoulder. "I hear your work with Immianthe is bearing fruit?"

"I'd like to think so," Chris agreed a little hesitantly, she didn't know the half of it. He felt like he'd been on shaky ground with Reyla lately, never quite confident where he stood. Part of it was the guilt he felt for all the trouble that seemed to follow him around, and his own flouting of her advice. He didn't do it on purpose, most of the time at least. "There have been a few hiccups with the prototypes, and I'm sure you'd be disgusted by the inefficiencies we consider acceptable."

"No doubt," Reyla scoffed to herself as she rounded into a less used corridor, headed toward the sanctuary of her office. She'd just finished a grueling morning in court, and the only time she'd had for him on short notice was during the precious peace of lunch. "Still, if you've created a workable device that will protect a human or unskilled Being from a broad array of magical threats, it is a worthy achievement. Wasteful, but worthy."

"I don't think I'll have too much trouble powering a few of them now, and we're still making improvements."

"Yes, I heard about that too," Reyla did look back this time, her expression not quite a full scowl. "I hope you covered your tracks. Trust a dragon to stub his toe on a whole mountain's worth of gold while the rest of us work for our living."

"When was the last time you worked for a living?" Chris chuckled to himself, perhaps foolishly, imagining the haughty elf throwing out hay bales on Jethry's farm in the bitter cold. It was quite an amusing image, and he didn't realise she'd rounded on him in fury until they'd almost crashed together.

"Excuse me!?" The tired elf boiled up at the loutish dragon, her slender eartips quivering despite herself. "I didn't see you in court today, balancing the needs and wants of an ungrateful, largely ignorant bunch of cretins. By all means, Christopher, if you think I've got it easy, I know a spell that will temporarily displace our consciousnesses. You could spend a day in these damnable heels, bumbling through my appointments, while I could wear your body like a puppet and tap my way through your precious brood. I wonder if they'd even notice? I might enjoy fucking Lillian in the ass!"

"That's not funny," Chris growled, fists clenching at his sides. "I didn't mean it like that. Shit, Reyla, I don't know what I meant."

Reyla breathed carefully through her nose, letting the cutting edge of her anger dull. She knew she'd lashed out, but it was such a thoughtless thing for him to say. A third of her workload was dealing with issues connected in some way to him. But it wasn't seemly for them to be screeching at each other in a hallway where anyone in the Compound might stumble across them.

"Accepted, and please disregard my vulgarity. Think before you speak. Now come on, let us go to my study."

They resumed their walk, both a little chagrined by the flare-up. Chris couldn't help noticing that Reyla could do with a big dose of her own advice, but knew better than to scratch at that scabby hypocrisy.

There were others in the branching corridors. Scant moments later, a door opened on their right and a round little man came staggering out, clothes and hair smoking. He wore a thick, heavily singed blue coat, goggles, and he was waving his hands before him as a cloud of white, nasty smoke billowed out into the hall.

"Gunter! Are you casting spells with phosphors again?! I'll have your skin if I hear any more complaints, this is one of my favorites shortcuts."

"Humblest apologies, M'lady," the wizard wrung his hands at the misfortune of being caught by his patroness. He bowed low as she swept past. "A most excellent incendiary, I promise results soon."

Chris looked back at the alchemist, who appeared to be catching his breath beside the door before he ventured back in. Phosphorus? That was mad, he wanted to talk to the guy, but hurried to catch Reyla as she steamed ahead, undaunted.

"I did cover our tracks with the gold, Reyla, I promise. What's wrong? You're not still mad about the dinner with your mom?"

"Please don't refer to that horrible eel of a woman as my 'mom'," Reyla ground out between pursed lips. "She's already put in a sizable order for crystals, demanding I put her to the top of the queue. I dare not test if she's ready to call my bluff, but giving in too easily will just make her bolder about trampling on me."

"We don't know what she knows," Chris tried to reason with optimism. "She only got a glimpse, barely that."

"It was enough," Reyla seethed just thinking about the proverbial barrel her mother had her bent over now. With Chris' secret gripped in her haggish claws, Vash's torments would be long and insufferable. "She wouldn't have left so abruptly, nor been so polite about it to you. I suspect dear Mother is older than she lets on. It's entirely possible she was actually around way back in the day."

"No way?! Back in the conflict involving the Old Gods?"

"I doubt we'll ever know, Chris. It's possible, and she has dropped various hints over centuries. But she's also a consummate liar, and a braggart when it suits her goals. Whatever the truth, she's deduced something important about you. Even if she doesn't have the whole of it, she feels she has enough advantage to press me."

"Well, why don't you say no?" Chris couldn't wrap his head around their dysfunctional relationship, and didn't particularly want to. "It seems to me that if you give in, she'll just keep asking for more. Tell her I said no if that would make it better."

In front of him, Reyla shook her head at his words, her perfectly straight silver hair flowing beautifully with the movement. Chris' eyes were naturally drawn towards the end of that moonlight-river, and the elegant shape of elven hips. He caught himself and remembered the sting of her latest outburst as an antidote to his draconic lust.

"It's not that simple, Christopher. You are right in a way, giving in to her demands will embolden her. If I refuse entirely, however, her pride will force her to escalate in return. I've seen her do it before. Mother is inclined to kick over the entire cage if she can't have her pick of the juiciest mallic-rats. So I will find my own points of leverage and accept whatever weak bargain I can wring out of her for now. It will help to ensure her silence, and then, slowly, she will be culpable in this little conspiracy. The last thing we need is you, personally, objecting to her. It would undermine my authority in this negotiation, and invite her to turn her attention more directly on you."

"Okay, let's avoid that," Chris agreed hastily, almost shuddering at the thought of Vash Narlakis becoming any sort of fixture in his life. One irritable elf was quite enough. "You know, I figured out why she got so upset, right before the end."

"Oh?" Reyla glanced back at the dragon, a smile quirking her lips despite herself. She wondered where the lad was taking this.

"The ruler of every territory may demand magical service or assistance of their subjects at their discretion or need. The terms of such service are the ruler's prerogative, though it is traditionally rewarded. I technically couldn't refuse."

Reyla sighed then, and stopped again to face her young dragon. It was a serious subject, one she'd been studiously avoiding since the first day he'd barged into her court. She glanced up and down the corridor, then took one of his huge hands on her own and cast a small sound-deadening field with a whispered phrase. None of this was the sort of discussion to have in a hallway, but she valued him too much to let him stew over her intentions a moment longer.

"It is an old custom, Chris, put down in our laws a very long time ago. I think it was likely written with wartime in mind. I have used it in the past, though never lightly," Reyla watched his striking blue eyes as she spoke carefully, measuring his reaction. "A wise leader would hesitate to enforce the privilege with an unwilling subject. It would drive them to seek shelter with another Lord or Lady, or court disloyalty in her own ranks."

"I get it, Reyla," Chris squeezed her hand gently in return. "It was less shocking once I actually understood what your mo ... what Vash was on about. It's not much different from a draft."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 21|
--------------------------------------------
"Good, I'm glad you understand. But let me finish, Christopher," Reyla nodded thankfully and committed to explaining more fully. "Beings are no better than humans, and at embracing societal changes, many of us are worse."

"I know, you dusty old things get stuck in your ways after a few centuries," Chris chuckled gamely.

"Hush, you impudent youngster, this is serious. I have lived with slavery, even owned slaves for more of my life than I have not. It might surprise you to know that I am actually somewhat of a radical liberal compared to many of my counterparts around the world. But the society I was born into is one of the most hierarchical, and least equitable there is. Our men have almost no part in deciding the course our people walk. They are prized for loyalty and docility, and treated more like prized livestock than men. So my mother balks that I don't use you damnably for my own ends. She doesn't really understand any other way, and doesn't want to because doing so would topple her from a throne built on thousands and thousands of years of oppression, stagnation, and hoarded knowledge."

"That's pretty grim," Chris agreed.

"Yes. I left long ago because I realised there was no future for me there. So, when I say that I have been sorely tempted these past months to make you my plaything, take it seriously. I think I could have done it too, if I started right after you arrived."

Chris watched Reyla frown slightly as she spoke almost indulgently about magically subduing him to her whims. Her delicately slanted eyes took on a far away quality as she relieved the momentous day of his presentation and the swearing of his oath.

"Mother wouldn't have even hesitated if you'd showed up on her doorstep. You would quite literally be following her around on a leash by now. I admit that many times in the past I have secured my own ends by unsavoury means, torture, indoctrination both magical and mundane, slavery, psychomancy, the taking of hostages. But I have also learnt that the strongest bonds of loyalty are those that are formed willingly, through mutual benefit and respect. I don't offer that to everyone, Chris. There is nowhere near enough time, and to be blunt, many people just are not worth the trouble."

Reyla paused, cocked her head as if considering something and glanced down at their linked hands before she continued.

"When I realised what you truly are, I rejoiced that I had left you be. Yet part of me despaired that it meant I might have missed my chance to bind you to myself. But it was the right choice, Chris. You are better than me, stronger and far more compassionate. You are too valuable to be stunted by my petty machinations, and so I won't let you trip over anyone else's if I can help it. I at least, can promise to never use you against your will. However you should not assume others will be as scrupulous."

"If you can't have me, no one else can?" Chris tried to make light of what she'd just admitted.

"Or something like that."

"Well, thanks. I do appreciate it," he mused, dropping her dainty hand to run his own nervously through his hair. After all she'd said, it seemed like the perfect time to raise the prickly issue he'd come to address. He wanted to be tactful, and appreciative, but suspected he would fall spectacularly flat. "I'll admit it's a little horrifying to consider the things you must have done down the centuries, but I try not to judge too harshly before wearing the shoes in question for a while."

Reyla smiled, partially extending a long, dark leg from her red skirts. A pointed silver heel was revealed, the shoe strapped elegantly around her ankle.

"These would fit you poorly, dragon, trust me."

"Yes, I see that. But, Reyla, all this raises a huge question. Jeez, how do I put this ... which one of us is in charge?"

"In charge? Why, I am, of course."

Reyla scoffed, stepping back slightly with a more calculating eye.

"No, no, I know you're the ruling Lady, I get that. You couldn't pay me enough to do your job," Chris reasoned. "I'm talking about the big stuff. I'm somehow connected to these supposedly ancient entities, right? These incredible abilities are both blessing and burden, but I intend to use them, and keep using them. After the Revelation, I want to try some pretty wacky stuff. I know you want me to lie low, but it just won't work, Reyla. I already got one vampire pregnant by accident, and this latest experiment is going to play havoc with the crystal market all over again. I keep doing all these remarkable things, not really on purpose, sooner or later it will be one too many. And don't get me started on my kids."

"Prodigal little whelps if you believe our good doctor."

"Yes, exactly. What I mean is that there will be consequences for concealing my nature, and the secret seems to become more and more of a farce every month. So when it's finally all out in the open, and I'm flying astronauts to Mercury, or magically walling off half of the oceans as marine reserves, are you still in charge then? Are you responsible somehow for reining me in? Would you, could you? Who negotiates with the Old Gods? Me? The Synod? You felt that damn thing when you came to rescue me, if you want that job too, it's yours in a heartbeat."

Chris paused, but Reyla was too deep in thought just then to reply. He continued because suddenly it was all overwhelming again, and he never seemed to be able to fully unburden himself at home. He needed her advice and comfort again, like that evening in her tiny, book-cramped apartments.

"I'm not even against the idea of lending you my magic for your own work, or letting you have the final say-so on some of the stuff I'm planning. But, Reyla, you're not perfect either. You've just admitted as much, and I felt your anger when you hit me with that freaky baton. I suspect I'm only now starting to scratch the surface in terms of getting to know you. You must have collected secrets upon secrets over thousands of years. How do I trust you, Reyla? I don't even trust myself with half of this crazy stuff. What if I screw it all up?"

Silence loomed close around them, artificially potent. Dragon and elf locked eyes, measuring, testing, weighing their past and pondering their future.

"You are so young," Reyla spoke without reproach, there might even have been a fond tone to her words. She hesitantly reached a finger toward his heart, racing mightily under stresses a Being thousands of years old might still find crushing. She barely touched his cotton shirt, barely felt the heat of him when she came to her decision. "Come on. Come with me, Christopher."

She brushed past him, headed back the way they'd just come.

"What?"

"You'll see."

"Reyla," Chris complained weakly, trotting a few steps to catch up with her long, perfect strides.

"You expect me to have answers to those weighty questions?" she actually laughed over her shoulder at him, already giddy with the import of what she was about to do. "Chris, no one can answer those questions, those insecurities. We all have them, and eventually we all learn to keep the worst of them to ourselves."

"Really?" Chris asked as they came to a more populated junction. "What about after a few thousand years?"

Reyla chose a broad, well lit passageway that shortly brought them to one of the ramp sections that linked to the ever-smaller, ever more exclusive lower levels.

She'd dropped the spell, that sort of magical field was taxing to maintain on the move. So she waited to reply until her ears only detected their own footsteps and Chris' breathing. Not that acting as counselor to the dragon was secret, but she didn't want it getting around that he needed this sort of pep talk. The speculation surrounding him was bad enough already.

"Especially after a few thousand years, Chris. At some point we all realise that on the inside, no one is much better or worse than anyone else. We make peace with who we are, our lot in life, and learn to accept the consequences of our decisions. Good or bad, no one can be responsible for what you decide to do other than yourself. Most humans don't realise how few truly meaningful decisions they have in their short lives. There's certainly not much value agonising over such things, not in the long term. And no one likes to listen to a moaner, Chris, especially one who is otherwise so blessed in every aspect of their life."

"I didn't mean to moan," Chris felt a little badgered by the accusation. "There's just a lot on my shoulders."

"You didn't, not really. But, Chris, everyone has their own private burdens. Venting your inner woes is not exactly the basis for a polite conversation in most situations. I try not to scream at my subjects about how angry it makes me when I have to adjudicate them squabbling over who slept with whom, three llamas, or a sack of magical jumping beans."

"I heard about the guy with the beans. Word is he hasn't stopped blushing after what you said to him, and it's been almost two weeks!"

"Oh hush! The point is, we try to keep flaws to ourselves, because that is the adult thing to do, Chris," Reyla expounded, unphased by his little barb. She needed some of that in her life, someone to make playful fun at her. "I have a temper, it is true. I am also glad that you come to me for such counsel, we are friends after all, and I am somewhat qualified. So, you have power, and some tough decisions will come with that. I can only offer advice, because you are right, I cannot make those decisions for you. Instead, I offer my advice."

"And the occasional timely rescue," Chris acknowledged his recent episode of magical distress. "Thanks for that."

"Oh, I still intend to milk you for all you are worth, dragon. Doubt it not."

They were still headed downward, the possibilities for their destination shrinking with every artfully vegetated switchback ramp. Before long they were at the bottom, and Chris' unease spiked with sudden concern.

The first checkpoint on the lowest level waved them through, the attentive guards glancing speculatively at one another. Their employer came down here seldom, and never with guests.

"Reyla, you're not going to duel me into the ground or anything crazy are you?" Chris worried as they approached the mildly familiar stained-copper doors where Annabel and Immianthe had been granted permission to practice unrestrained magic with Bartholomew. "If I've offended you, I -"

"Ha!" the elf chuckled darkly to herself. "Oh, no, Christopher, it's much worse than that."

That carefree manner was strictly out of character. Chris' hands were growing clammy as they passed straight by Timothy's empty office, and his unease only grew when they passed by the disused dueling chamber as well.

"You asked how you could trust me?" Reyla continued down the long corridor, "I must admit it is an excellent question. Were I in your position, I would not continue our relationship on such unequal terms."

They went under a pronounced portal, an intricate archway mounted there for no obvious reason other than to signify a threshold of some sort. Chris shivered as he ducked his head slightly, new energies stirring softly around them. The archway hadn't been a defence, it was containing something. Reyla abruptly rounded a ninety degree corner. The off-white subterranean passageway continued ahead, this one completely void of any embellishment, door, or decoration at all.

About twenty meters away, a guard looked up in disbelief. He was an older man, but Chris noted instantly that he was a fighter, wiry with lean, ropey muscle under his printed rock band t-shirt. Reyla wasn't a problem, but the man registered Chris' presence and instantly fumbled for something on his suspiciously solid-looking desk. The guard suddenly sprang back, retreating down the corridor away from them.

Light blazed into existence ahead, silhouetting and yet obscuring the retreating guard. The magical orbs mounted on the ceiling suddenly dazzled with a multitude of spectra. Chris halted where he was as hidden recesses along the passageway flowered silently open, tracking the intrusion. Chris could sense staggeringly powerful magics awaking in some of the pockets, and bare hints of subtler more insidious workings in others.

Crystalline nozzles peaked out at them on weirdly articulated metal stalks, observing keenly with artificial eyes, no doubt ready to blast him to dust. Chris heard the muffled hum and clank of huge cogworks behind the stone to his left and right, and had the disturbing premonition that the walls could crush together abruptly by some unseen signal.

Reyla was still walking, but now the man was standing his ground up ahead, poised low and ready, a vicious long knife in each scarred hand. He bore fully twelve inches of glinting steel in each, and he looked proficient in their use.

"It is I," Reyla advanced, arms opened to either side, completely confident in the rightness of her presence. "Please, Lark, administer the tests."

Chris held himself and his magic very still, hanging back by several more paces as Reyla finally stopped before the abandoned checkpoint. The security station looked to have been hewn intact from a very thick trunk, it took up more than half of the hallway. As Chris wondered at Reyla's odd words, his imagination ran wild on possibilities. If anything else had been spoken, or by anyone else...

"And him?" Lark wasn't yet convinced, gesticulating toward Chris with the tip of a blade. "Your orders were quite specific...."

"My orders are my own, Lark," Reyla announced implacably, imperious and yet phrased like a lecture to both of them. "Mine to keep, and mine to break. To have it any other way would be madness. Look aside now, Christopher. I might entrust what is behind this door to your keeping, but not the keys."

Chris did as he was asked, looking back down the corridor longingly. He hadn't planned on delving into Reyla's secrets this afternoon, he'd sought clarity and resolve, not more to cloud his overtaxed judgement.

This felt like a trap, beyond just being caught in her web, this could be the fateful entombment in a cocoon of her finest silk. Spiders always seemed to do that right before they supped on the liquified innards. He could still flee. But she'd mentioned their friendship, and her strangely upbeat demeanor now tantalised his curiosity. What lay at the heart of Lady Reyla Narlakis' vaunted nexus?

A heavy clang spoke of a huge locking mechanism unsealing nearby.

"Sorry, my Lady, I thought perhaps an illusion...," Lark trailed off under the Drow's regard, but the relief was in his gruff voice. "Well nevermind, it is you, and the young dragon is your own business."

"So he is, though I applaud your wariness. Timothy chose well for this duty," some of Reyla's haughtiness had returned, but when she refocused toward Chris, bejewelled fingers outstretched, she flashed him a perfectly white grin. Her dark lips pursed wider in private amusement as he hesitated. "Take my hand, Christopher, and do not let go for anything until we stand outside once again. I know your deepest secret, and so, if we are truly friends, it is only fair that you know mine."

Chris followed in a daze, what choice was there? His hand monstrously dwarfed hers, and yet he clutched her long fingers like it was Susan dropping him off for his first day at school. Ahead, the corridor ended in opaque yellow light. Reyla led them straight toward it as she began her explanation.

"After my first true taste of battle, I knew I would someday die. At the time, I feared that it would come to me sooner rather than later. Mother spent our lives too easily back then, not just clan sisters, but her own true daughters as well. She even sent out troops of our menfolk, under supervision, to harass our lighter-skinned cousins. We acquitted ourselves well, though the true cost in life and lost knowledge would not be felt for centuries. Our folk had just come through a time of upheaval, consolidating several outlying settlements into the ancestral keep. It was somewhat crowded down there, and I suspect mother used the opportunity to weed out competition, for that was surely the result."

"Why were you fighting?" Chris asked, closing his eyes and wincing as the end of the long corridor loomed. It radiated heat like a well-stoked fire. The luminosity was bright red through his eyelids.

"For pride, greed, defaulted debts, and any number of long-irrelevant reasons," Reyla sighed at the interruption, changing course slightly to the right and tugging him along. "That is the way of war, Chris, it picks you up and drags you across the coals no matter the reason it started. But hush now, let me tell my story. And open your eyes, silly boy. We are safely inside the disintegration field now, so don't let go."

Chris' eyes flew open, and he almost did let go. He glared down at her, questioning every choice that had led to him following this devious elf into a disintegration field, whatever that was exactly. Then his eyes caught up to his surroundings, and he swivelled around to gawk at the marvelous latticework of silver supporting and surrounding them. Behind, and retreating around the curve of the wall with every forward step, the corridor leading back to the Compound shimmered and wavered. It was still visible, but seemed a world away already.

"Battle did not suit me at first. I was more interested in books and tablets than swordplay and tactics. But Mother is the matriarch, and her direct orders are not lightly disobeyed. So, I went to war, side by side with my sisters and our various allies. I disliked the fighting and killing, but was astonished to find that I had somewhat of a talent for it. My avid reading had taught me much of old and potent magics, and once my temper was roused in the heat and stink and screams of the melee, I am told I was a terror."

Chris heard her words, but his focus kept drawing toward the disorienting pattern of the walls. Triangles, squares, and perfect hexagons. They weren't right somehow. Magic pulsed slowly in from every angle, fraying at his focus, yet retreating when he reached out. The way ahead looked identical to the way back, curving out of sight, narrowing and domed into utter darkness above. It was as if she led him into a never-ending spiral shell, long abandoned by some enormous hermit crab.

"Blood magics are a disgracefully powerful school if the enemy is foolish enough to close, and the alliance of houses our cousins brought to the war were eager for bloodshed. Mother was right in a way, it did toughen me. But that was when I truly started my search. I was young, reckless, and ambitious, though I hid that as best I could from my surviving family. I did not want to die gloriously on the field, nor to a poisoned dagger from behind. So, in my brief sojourns, I redoubled my research. It was quite a joke amongst the clan, the fearsome, bookish young daughter hiding away in the deepest stacks of her mother's library. I told my mother I was researching better ways to kill, and it wasn't even a lie. But what I truly searched for was a way to live, to survive."

She must have led him three or more times around the spiral, Chris wasn't sure now. The walls were probably thin, though they looked solid enough. He dared not even brush his shoulder against one. Perfect geometric tiles of stone, crystal, and gem trapped into place by the painstaking labour of a thousand goblins. That's how he would do it anyway. But what about the silver cage? He hadn't seen a break or join of any sort, but they must exist. Did the structure continue below their feet, in mirror of the narrowing chasm above? He was sure it must, for symmetry's sake alone. With a start, Chris realised that the rhythm of magic he felt was in tune with the faint pulse in the elf's fingers he still gripped. He shuddered at the thought, damping down dragon instinct that growled at him to flee.

"Not much further now, dragon," Reyla spoke with chilling timing. "I did survive that war, to my own surprise. It ended in betrayal, stalemate, and atrocity. Our clan was ruined, more than decimated, though it was always framed as a pyrrhic victory. Both sides still claim to have won, even a few thousand years later when only fools should care. I had already found hints that my search might bear fruit, so I continued my efforts and began to travel too. A few decades later, Mother offered me the dubious honour of a high position in her court once filled by my dead older sister. I refused, and suddenly our animosity was given sunlight to grow in. Things became uneasy between us, so I removed myself from high society and began preparing my departure. I formally cut ties with the clan a century later, stealing away with knowledge the old bitch had long forgotten, or never bother to learn."

It was the internal angles, Chris thought. They looked okay dead-on. But in the corners of his vision, they were off, somehow less or more than they should be as if the shapes to either side were sapping them away. The pattern seemed to bulge out at him or shrink suddenly. It happened seemingly at random, but never when he gave it his focus. It drew the eye, and disquieted the mind. Everything was so similar, an endless repetition of geometry folding into itself, and also back out.

"So I journeyed for many, many years. I lived amongst humans for a while, and I dabbled here and there with forces better left alone. I felt another war stirring on the wind, and so I began my great work. Of course it was not nearly so large back then, and much easier to hide."

"Reyla, what is it? What is this crazy place?"

She laughed again, suddenly girlish, with a secret kept too long to herself. Her beautiful grey eyes seemed bright in the dim, curving passage. She kept his hand but began walking backward so that they were face to face. One of her expressive dark ears flicked, and she licked her lips in anticipation.

"It is I," the ancient elf smirked. "Really, Chris, you might have figured some of it out by now."

The endless curve abruptly sharpened, and Reyla coaxed him through a huge hexagonal portal to the left. Chris would have sworn it wasn't there from just meters away.

They were in a very strange room of sorts, the pattern ever present in every facet. Ever perfect and wrong in equal measure.

The chamber was an even larger hexagon, with two other openings leading away into unnatural dimness, one upward, one downward. But Chris barely gave them a glance, his eyes were locked on the object at the centre of the room.

Metallic, and somehow fibrous. Or perhaps a crystalline thing. It spun there, as alien as a neutron star. A true nexus, holding his mind's eye like a fly on fresh glue paper.

Lazily suspended between great tetrahedra jutting seamlessly from floor and ceiling, the mysterious object slowly spun. It never truly touched either tip that he could see, but the energy it gave off was real enough, washing over his senses like a lighthouse beacon in the dark.

Flash, flash, flash.

The room, and Chris' entire awareness seemed to tunnel down toward it, yet registered no lasting detail. A forever-folding, forever growing aberration of repeated geometry.

It pulsed a gentle, silver-toned light in exact offbeat to the magic. So mesmerising was it, that Chris' perspective jaunted back and forth. One blink and it rotated as he watched. The next it was stationary, while he and the entire structure spun around and around it in perpetual orbit.

"Beautiful," Chris heard himself murmur.

"Thank you," Reyla squeezed his hand. Intentionally or not, the stimulus provided a breaking in the pattern's hold.

Chris refocused, blinking blearily afterimages from his eyes. It could have been days for all he knew. In the moment he glanced to ask for an explanation, Chris registered the figures encased behind the tessellated wall at their backs. Words died on his tongue, and he spun to see that symmetry was indeed given holy precedence in this place.

Annabel's vivid retelling, and Immi's dark mutterings started to make a sick sense.

Four, three, and crowded-six ... no, five. Naked, perfect copies of Reyla embedded in the bizarre structure. Held in some unknown medium behind the repeating shapes, awaiting ... what?

Twenty four modest, yet sumptuous dark tits, unstirred by the rise and fall of breath.

Twelve pairs of grey eyes, all staring blankly from behind a mathematically perfect cage. All staring at the churning heart of the pattern.

The thirteenth pair looked unerringly at him, and her ancient heart was in those pretty eyes.

Birds seldom fly North into the teeth of winter, but these two were not your average birds. Their flock was only two, and their imperative was not one of migration.

They barely stopped to rest, uncairing of rain, snow, or sunshine. If they did, it was not to peck and scratch at grain or tossed breadcrumbs. Nor did the red-eyed pair gorge themselves on the fleeting bounties of the shoreline, or trill to each other in fervent mating affirmation.

The doves dropped unsuspected upon isolated farmers, fishermen, and one very unlucky woman who had done nothing except decide to wash her clothes by a stream in anticipation of a job interview.

They left inexplicable corpses in their trail. A thin string of dead so dissociated by road, mountain, and boarder that no one ever did connect the dots.

Eventually they no longer flew together, for each had their own destination. Were they not entirely possessed, the mated doves would not have willingly separated. But their brief, instinctual reluctance was overpowered by the domination set upon them thousands of miles ago.

One veered slightly west, headed for a quiet, unassuming farmyard on an alpine prairie.

The other continued on, north and east. It flew over great tracts of cropland, forests, and bustling cities. Its quarry was eventually located crouched at the bottom of the steep, foreboding gully, claimed and tainted long ago.

The long-limbed, unshorn creature barely glanced up as the dove alighted in the tines of its one unbroken antler, too intent on gulping down marrow from the grizzled bone it had just laid open between two gorey rocks.

"And what do you want?" The shaggy fellow eventually rumbled in a voice thick and cracked with disuse. He leered up at the bird through lank, twig-tangled hair that might have once been brown. Its eyes were sickly yellow, too large, and more goat's than man's. It tossed one half of its calciferous meal down toward the little gurgling stream. The undamaged side of his face twitching at the pleasant, hollow clatter it stirred before it came to rest, just one amongst thousands and thousands.

The dove fluttered down beside the creature on the great, alter-like slab of soiled stone, dangerously close to gore-flecked, strangle-fingered hands. The bird cocked its head side to side, beady red eyes seeming brighter in the thin light at the bottom of this jagged knife slash deep in the wooded hills. It began pecking strangely in the filth, then scratching with its little feet. After pausing to inspect its work, the demon-dove gave up and hopped toward the nearest midden of bleached bones.

The man-thing growled, but the bird only dumped fizzing excrement by way of reply. That seemed to settle the matter of desecration for now.

The feathered messenger began a lengthy, flapping process of selecting manageable bone fragments off the heap, then arduously dragging and arranging them on the stone. It was nearly crushed in a rattly avalanche, but the loosened pile yielded appropriately sized material far more easily after that.

It took a long time, for the task was unsuited to a small bird, and some of the bones were very large, deer, bear, and perhaps something in between.

"My ... tri ... umph, triumph, yes," the forest nightmare ponderously sounded out each roughly formed word when it was done. "My triumph is almost at hand. Soon. Follow the bird. Go quiet."

"And why, should I, help you, Radek?" Azenoth finally looked up to address the winged minion, suspicion in his hunched posture.

The eared-dove cood indignantly, puffing its chest feathers and bobbing its little head. It clearly cared nothing that Azenoth could wring its neck in an instant as it paced angrily before its squatting audience. Eventually, it hopped onto the bone words and began furiously kicking or buffeting them about with its wings until they hinted roughly at just two.

"Godling bones."
