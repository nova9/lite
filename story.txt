<b>Part 1 - Prologue: Decision Points</b>

(<i>Author's note: This is another of those 'bridge' stories that takes care of groundwork and sets up for more stories in the future. Some may find it dry and tedious, and your patience with it is appreciated.</i>)

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette from the roof of the building at the corner of College and Riverside, with City Hall in the background, at 7:00am, Wednesday, September 11th. "Protests erupt at the Town & County Council meeting over the new Charter and a proposed new Police structure!"

Bettina began: "The Council meeting was in front of a packed house, as TCFD Firefighters were joined by teachers as well as residents of the northern County suburbs to protest the proposed changes. When illegitimate Mayor Daniel Allgood, who many believe stole the Mayoral election from Eldrick X. Weaver last November, attempted to suppress the protesters's voices by preventing them from speaking, many of them began shouting and screaming to disrupt the Council proceedings."

Bettina: "Order was restored when a large number of Police Officers and Sheriff Deputies, under the command of Captain Teresa Croyle, violently acted against their Fire Department colleagues and forcibly removed them from the scene. Fourteen arrests were made. Commander Donald Troy was not at the scene taking responsibility for his Police Department's brutally violent methods on behalf of Mayor Daniel Allgood in suppressing the rights of our Citizens. Once again ducking and shirking his responsibilities, Commander Troy has refused to respond to repeated requests for comment by KXTC."

Bettina: "And we have with us Karl Frazier of Public Policy Polling, with some new polling numbers. Karl, how is the Charter polling?"

"Not very well, Bettina." said Karl Frazier, appearing on a split-screen with Bettina. "Voters from the suburban County areas to the north are strongly opposed to the Charter, as only 15% approve of it, while 75% say they will vote against it. And in the southern areas of the County dominated by minority voters, the numbers are also dismal, as only 40% plan to vote for it, while 50% are against it, and 10% undecided. Right now, Bettina, the new Charter looks headed for a huge defeat."

"Thank you, Karl!" Bettina said happily. As the screen came to her fully, she went on: "And in State news, former State Senator Maxine Watts issued a statement that she will not be running for Lieutenant Governor next year, but will run for her old State Senate seat. Roll tape."

Tape rolled, showing Maxine Watts saying "Part of my campaign will be gathering support to impeach the racist Val Jared and remove him from office for his persecution of hardworking undocumented workers!"

Back to Bettina live: "<i>Deeply unpopular</i> Governor Jared's spokeswoman Sarah Honeysuckle issued a statement saying that Maxine Watts was 'unimportant' and her words of 'no value'. Black civic leaders were infuriated, calling the statements 'typically racist hate speech from Jared and Honeysuckle'. They are demanding that Jared resign..."

"If you had been there, Don," Cindy Ross said as we drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room, "Bettina would've blamed you for the NEA's paid agitators getting out of control. But since you weren't there, she blames you for... wait for it... not being there to suppress the agitators."

I chuckled. "That's about right." I said.

"Bettina is unimportant." growled Sheriff Griswold. "And her words are of no value." We all chuckled at that.

"Maxine Watts running for State Senate." I quipped. "Commander Troy refuses to respond to repeated requests for comment." More laughter. We were having too much fun with this.

"Bettina was lying about who was arrested, too." said Teresa Croyle, getting serious. "We arrested only two Fire Department employees; the rest either have or have had membership in the NEA. And six of the twelve we arrested were not residents of this County. They're being held for 72 hours, and then we'll see about denying them bail as flight risks."

"Good." I said. "I want to personally introduce myself to them, and have a pleasant few minutes of conversation with them."

"As opposed to a few minutes of pleasant conversation with them." the Sheriff said astutely, realizing the purposeful form of my sentence.

"Why weren't you there, Don?" Cindy asked. "Not that you needed to be, but you usually are."

"I took a night off from it all." I said. "Those demonstrations... and you are right, Cindy, that they were paid NEA agitators... were meant for me. But I was not there, so they were yelling at the wind."

"By the way, Commander," said Teresa Croyle, "do you believe those poll numbers?"

"Not at all." I said. "Notice that Frazier didn't give the percentage margin of error, and that's because it's six or seven percent, not the normal three percent. I do believe the County High School districts are opposed to it in large numbers, but if he's saying minority districts are against it in those numbers, I'd suggest adding that 6% margin, and you get 46-44% for it. And it may be better than that, since I don't think 10% are really undecided."

"Good points, Crowbar." growled Sheriff Griswold. "I happen to have some polling data, which shows that Frazier's numbers are nothing short of 'fake news'. Except for the high-priced housing districts, the Charter is looking pretty good."

"It's still not a done deal, though, Sheriff." I said. "The ads are going to start coming out against it. The Fire Department Captain's Union is sponsoring a media blitz, as is the very wealthy NEA."

"Sheriff," said Chief Moynahan, "the Media is making a very big dealllll about Police Officers arresting Firefighters. What do we need to do about that?"

"I was proud of Captain Croyle last night; she did exactly the right things." said the Sheriff. Teresa looked like the Sheriff had bestowed a medal upon her.

Griswold continued: "I've put out word that Firefighters have the right of free speech, but not to the point of violently disrupting Council meetings, and that arrests could lead to their termination. And Commander Ross, make no statements to the Press about arresting any Firefighters, just refer all inquiries to the Sheriff's Department. Don't fuel the corrupt Media's agenda and their hatred."

"Yes sir." Cindy said.

"And one more thing." Chief Moynahan said. "Not one word about this being the anniversary of the September 11th, 2001 attacks. Have people forgotten so soon?"

I replied: "No sir. But I'm not surprised the America-haters of KXTC didn't say anything. Let's see what Fox Eight says. And I have one question: what happened with the Police structure proposals at the Council meeting?"

Chief Moynahan said "During the public meeting, an amendment to strip out the Fire Department structure issues was approved 7-3, with Colby, Schoen, and J.P. Goldman dissenting. Then they took the Police part into Executive Session, and my presence as well as the Sheriff's was 'requested'.

The Chief continued: "It was pretty heated, and the Mayor really bore down with the protocols. Reginald B.F. Lewis offered to vote for it provided that an amendment to force the dispersal of Detectives to the Precincts was attached. That was defeated, 5-6. Then the Mayor said that he did not want to be the tiebreaking vote for the overall bill, so it had to have a clear majority or he would vote against it."

"Whaa?" I gasped. "What is that about?"

Sheriff Griswold took it up: "I can understand it. If there wasn't going to be a Charter vote at the end of the month, he might've helped force it through, but why commit to that when there's a vote ahead that will tell us what the People think? Anyway, it still looked like Sorrells and Weston might vote with the Republicans to pass it, but Sorrells made a motion to lay it on the table... and it passed, 10-0. So anyone can bring it back up, but it looks like they won't unless and until the Charter passes."

"Good grief." I muttered...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Hello and welcome!" said Catrina Pierce at 8:00am from the KFXU studios. "Thank you for joining us on Fox Eight University Sunrise! I'm Catrina Pierce, and with me on this day, the anniversary of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, is Meredith Peller. Hello, Meredith."

"Hello Catrina. Hello, everyone." said Meredith. "As we remember those that died in New York, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon on September 11th, 2001, it's a busy news day right here in our County. Let's go to Priya Ajmani for more. Priya!"

"Thank you Catrina, thank you Meredith!" said Priya happily. "Good morning, everyone! The Town & County Police and Sheriff's Deputies made fourteen arrests at the Town & County Council meeting last night. Of those fourteen that were arrested, six were not from this County, and Fox Eight News has learned that many of the arrested persons have ties to the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union. The NEA is bitterly opposed to the new Charter proposal, as property taxes for schools will be controlled by the Town & County Assembly as it is now, and not by the new School Board, which is what the NEA has demanded."

Priya: "And after the public meeting, the Council met in Executive Session over Sheriff Griswold's proposals for a new rank structure for the Public Safety Department, which also is included in the Charter proposal. The Council voted to table the proposal, but may take it up again if the Charter passes, which will allow the Public Safety Department to begin implementing its structure early..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"If the Charter passes," asked Teresa Croyle as we sat in my office and watched, "won't it go into effect immediately?"

"Yes and no." I said. "This is all <i>assuming</i> it passes... yes, I know, dangerous word... but we set the vote date so that elections for newly created posts can be held on Election Day in November instead of having to have a special election. But most of the new institutions and changes don't kick in until January 1st."

I continued: "The EMS won't come into being until January 1st, though the Sheriff can begin acting to implement it upon the Charter's passage. The new School Board won't be in effect until January 1st. And our new rank structure won't kick in until January 1st, unless and until the Council puts it in place early."

After a moment, I said, "Okay, where are the arrested suspects? I want to talk to them."

"They're here." said Teresa Croyle. "And their arraignment is at 10:00am. Somebody ran to Judge Nance and told him we had them here, and he moved the hearing up."

"I'd better hurry, then." I said...

<b>Part 2 - Groundwork and Gruntwork</b>

8:30am, Wednesday, September 11th. After glancing at the files of the fourteen perps arrested the night before, there were two that I wanted to talk to. They were brought to Interrogations-1 and -2, and handcuffed to the tables, per my instructions. Then I went inside, Detective Parker in tow.

I recognized the guy in I-2: he was one of the thugs that had accosted the Charter Commission at the dinner at Applebee's. (<i>Author's note: 'Casting Aspersions', Ch. 04.</i>) I went in.

"Well, well, well." I said to him as Parker and I came up to the table. "Last time I saw you, I said it was up to you if an arrest would be made. Looks like you made your choice."

"I want a lawyer." the man snarled. "I will answer no questions without a lawyer present."

"Okay." I said. We left the room and went into I-1. I did not recognize the man, but he looked like he aspired to be a Union boss one day. Before I could even speak, he just looked up at me and said "Lawyer."

"You'll have plenty of time to get one." I said. "You're not from this Town & County. I'll be asking for no bail." With that, I left, followed by Parker.

As we walked down the hallway towards MCD and my office, I texted Paulina "<i>Go for no bail on the out-of-Towners.</i>" 

A minute later she texted back "<i>I'm not assigned to it. Walters gave it to Dwayne Gregory. We'll talk later.</i>"

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

At 10:00am, my strategy session with Cindy was interrupted by a call from FBI Special Agent In Charge Jack Muscone. He asked if I could meet him for lunch at the Cop Bar at 11:30am. I said I'd bring Jerome Davis with me, and Muscone agreed. I called Jerome and made sure he could make it.

"What's that about?" Cindy asked when I hung up.

"I don't know." I said. "I haven't seen Jack or really talked to him for days. Maybe Tanya put him on a diet, and this is the only way he can safely get double cheeseburgers." Cindy burst out laughing at that.

I then asked "I saw you talking with Tim Jenkins at the reservoir ceremony. How are things in Southport?"

"Good." said Cindy, her ice blue eyes lighting up just a little bit. "He and Ted Crenshaw have cleaned out the rotgut infecting the Southport FBI office, and gotten some new people in there. Now they're starting some operations, even looking at Turpin Heights in the State to the south."

I nodded. "That's a lot of Swamp to drain. A lahhhht of Swamp..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

As Jerome Davis and I came into the back 'Command Room' of the Cop Bar, Jack Muscone was already there. And he had someone with him.

"Karina!" I said as Special Agent Karina White came up to greet me, giving me a hug. I introduced her to Jerome, telling him that Karina had greatly helped us bring Geiger's 'Iscariot' operation to a successful conclusion.

As we sat down, I said "So how are things going with BAFTE, Karina?"

"That's what we're here to talk about." said Jack Muscone, as I noted the twinkle in Karina's eyes as Jack said "Allow me to introduce you to the new FBI Assistant Special Agent In Charge for my region."

"Oh wow...." I said, my voice getting lower. "You're transferring to the FBI?"

"Yes." said Karina. "SAC Muscone offered me the opportunity, and it was one I couldn't refuse." That made my eyebrows go up a little bit.

"Yeah, he's seeing it." said Muscone, seeing that I was seeing it. Jerome grinned, also seeing it.

Karina said: "Yes, Jack pulled me out of the BAFTE. He also pulled out a couple of my best guys and sent them to work with Crenshaw and Jenkins in Southport."

"O-kayyy." I said. "And what I'm seeing is that something happened to that special BAFTE team. What happened there?"

"Four hundred years ago..." Jack said. "Yes, Don, that's part of the story. The Swamp Frogs realized what we were doing, and they moved quickly to break up that BAFTE team. I got Karina and the two guys, but most of the others were scattered to the four winds: Seattle, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York. Some in the BAFTE, but some to other agencies, mostly the DEA."

"Any in Pennsylvania?" I asked.

"Yeah, a couple." said Jack, trying to sound nonchalant. "But that's not important------"

"Embedded in the Swamp Frog hotbeds up there?" I asked. Muscone saw I wasn't going to let it go.

"We really shouldn't talk about it." said Jack.

"Okay." I said "But I hope they have someone watching their backs, especially if the Swamp knows who they are."

"They'll be fine, Don." Jack said. "Anyhoo, and changing the subject, I appreciate you taking up for Tanya and letting that scumbag Reginald B.F. Lewis know what will happen to him when he says things like that to her."

"Absolutely my pleasure to have done that." I said, though a bit moodily. "But speaking of not wanting to talk about something, let's just move on from that. So tell me about your personnel situation in Southport, beyond Karina's buddies."

Jack's eyes cut toward me and Karina gave us a brilliantly lovely grin. "I see what you were saying about him." she said.

"Yep." said Muscone. He then said "Crenshaw and Jenkins are doing very well down there, and the first thing they did was uncover some corruption within the Federal agencies down there. FBI, BAFTE, DEA agents. Seven were found to be compromised, taking bribes from the Mob, mostly Orrin B. Taggart's organization. They were fired."

 "The result of that," continued Muscone, "is that Crenshaw wants to set up a rotation of Agents between Southport and other places, to try to keep the Mob from recruiting Agents. If the bad guys try to get to someone, he or she can be move along to another location. Harder to find out who they are in order to threaten them, too."

"The problem with that," said Karina, "is that we just don't have that many people to rotate. Heck, I'm trying to build a team myself."

"And I'm not sure I like the idea of rotating people." said Muscone. "Doesn't allow for building camaraderie. Flip side of that, Team Lazarus might've stayed together <i>too</i> long. What do <i>you</i> think, Lieutenant Davis?"

"The logistics of rotating Federal Agents is something I would not want to have to figure out, sir." said Jerome. "Maybe something like the military does... moves after three or four years in one location." We all nodded.

"So tell me, Jack, Karina." I said. "The jury tampering in the Blassingame case. What's going on with that?"

"That was the first thing Jack handed me when I walked in the door." said Karina. "I've been working with Lindy Linares of SAC Cardigan's cyber group and Melina Allgood, the Supervisory Agent here. SBI Inspector Britt Maxwell has been helpful, but she's swamped. So who in the TCPD can I work with?" 

I looked over at Lt. Davis, who said "The Data Guyz and Lt. Mary Milton were working on that one, sir."

"I'll speak with Captain Perlman." I told Karina. "I'll get her to assign someone as your POC on that." POC meant 'point of contact', and everyone at the table understood.

"Thank you." said Karina. "We've got the the people at the Hotel that controlled the systems, but they didn't know anything of value. They were just paid to rig the system and show the videos. If we're going to get David Rovers and Andrew Parsons, I'm going to have to find more. A lot more."

I nodded. "And even then, it'll be tough. You may have to go through the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), and there are probably Swamp Frogs in there, too, protecting the bad guys."

Muscone said "We'll worry about that when the time comes, so don't worry about it. But speaking of the Blassingame case, he's starting to marshal his forces against the Government, now that there's no hope left to save his son via a plea deal. And ditto that for U.S. Senator Samuel Russell."

"They didn't have to let him go back to Washington, did they?" I asked.

"Nope." said Muscone. "There's now a fight over the language of that clause about not hindering them from going to their Congressional duties. They may say the murder and rape charges are enough to retain him. I also had word out of Washington that the Senate may move to expel him if he doesn't resign. But I think all that is just talk. If they did that, he would turn whistleblower, and he could blow up the Establishment like nobody's business."

"Is he being guarded?" I asked. "His life is in extreme danger, you know."

"City Police and State Troopers, the anti-riot guys, are on guard duty at the Cannon Building." said Muscone. "He ain't goin' nowhere."

2:00pm, Wednesday, September 11th. Paulina Patterson came to my office, looking tired. I had her sit down and I poured her some coffee.

"Thanks." she said as she took the mug and gratefully drank from it.

"I take it things did not go well in Court?" I said once I'd settled into my chair.

"No." Paulina said. "Folsom gave it to Nance. We have tried and tried to get Folsom to not give cases like these to Nance, but he just doesn't get it that Nance is activist and absolutely hostile to a reasonable and fair application of the law."

"Or he doesn't want to get it." I said, meaning Folsom.

"No, I really believe he's ignorant." said Paulina. "He blindly thinks that all judges are honest and fair. You remember Judge J.B. Stone?"

"Oh yes." I said. (<i>Author's note: 'Case of the Black Badge', Ch. 01, among other places.</i>)

"Folsom never understood that Stone was stone-cold dirty as well as a racist." Paulina said. "He was shocked when Stone was forced to go to Coltrane County."

"Folsom is politically attuned himself." I said. "Tries to play all sides. So what happened today?"

"Gregory tried." Paulina said. "I'll give him credit; he really tried. But he doesn't understand that when we deal with Judge Harry Nance, we have to go through certain motions, such as asking for another judge, and we have to set up grounds for appeals, so that we can do that and get better, or at least more fair, rulings from Folsom. Gregory didn't do that."

"Nance let them all go?" I asked.

"He took particular delight in letting those that were from out-of-Town go, and on their own recognizance." Paulina said. "He also gave the other ones that we think are NEA-hired no bail; he just released them on recognizance. The Firefighters had representation paid for by their Union, but their lawyer made a huge mistake: he made a Motion to Sever. Nance granted it, then slammed the Firefighters with half a million dollars bail each."

I was stunned. "Wowwwww." I said. "Why did he do that?"

"I was hoping you could tell me." Paulina said. "And Gregory really did fuck up there; he should've objected and said the bail was excessive... which it was, especially if Nance is giving out-of-Town thugs no bail at all."

"Well..." I said, putting that into its compartment of the mind for the moment, "<i>c'est la vie, c'est la guerre</i> on that. So what else is there?"

"How do you always know that there's a 'something else'?" she asked with a knowing smile. I just raised my eyebrows a couple of times.

"Yes, there's something else." said Paulina. "You already know that Miriam Walters has been working on her own restructuring of the D.A.'s Office. She's put out the word that they're hiring Investigators. She called Geiger and he turned her down. Walters has also been rearranging the deck chairs, and wants to have DDAs supervised by ADAs."

"Yes." I said. "And she wants to elevate her <i>crony</i> Savannah Fineman by having her as an ADA over <i>you</i> by demoting you to DDA. But if she does that, Franklin will play the race card if you don't do it yourself."

"Exactly." Paulina said. "Franklin Washington told me this morning that he's gotten word that Walters has been having meetings with outside legal counsel... attorneys experienced in civil rights cases, particularly on the side of Government or those being sued for racial discrimination. And I don't have to be the Iron Crowbar to see what that means."

"You think she's getting advice on the legal ramifications of demoting you, and dealing with your legal reaction if and when you sue her for racial discrimination?" I asked.

"Yes." said Paulina. "That is exactly what I thought when I first heard it, and Franklin thought the same thing when he heard it."

"Make that three of us." I said. "Of course, if she goes through with it, you could use it against her, saying she knew she was acting in a racist manner by consulting with lawyers over it."

"I don't want it to get to that point." said Paulina. "And I don't want to play the race card. I don't want Tasha to think that's the answer to every obstacle in life she's going to face."

"Yeah, I agree with you on that point." I said. After a moment of contemplation, I said: "I can't believe Walters is acting so stupidly. If she really wants to help Fineman beat Ted Mason for the Solicitor post, she should have Savannah be the DDA and successfully prosecute our cases while you make like Bowser and just sit there and supervise."

Paulina giggled at the Bowser reference, and I continued: "Instead, she... no, I just don't understand it... unless it really is racism that is Walters's motive..."

<i>*KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*</i>

The knock on my door was followed by the door cracking open and Cindy poking her head into my office. "Sorry to interrupt." she said. "The Sheriff has called for an 'all hands on deck' meeting at 2:30pm at City Hall. Everyone in the Public Service Department with oak leaf clusters or higher on his or her shoulders is required to be in attendance..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

2:30pm. The Police contingent of Chief Moynahan, Deputy Chief Ross, and myself arrived in the conference room around the corner from the private Council Chamber. I swept for bugs as the others came in: Fire Chief Quinlin, Assistant Fire Chief Davies, Fire Marshal Singer, Battalion Chiefs Tucker and Carlson, Public Health Officer Beth Paige, and Assistant PHOs Stella Waters and Rohit Gupta. Last but not least came in Sheriff Griswold, Chief of Staff Oswald, and Senior Deputy Sheriff Louis Bailey.

Three long tables, seating five people each, were arranged in a triangle formation. The Sheriff would be at the center of the 'head' table, flanked by his Deputies, then the Fire and Police Chiefs at the ends. Cindy and I sat on the left side (the Sheriff would look right to see us), along with the Public Health officials, and the five Fire Department officers were at the third table.

"Take your seats, please." growled Griswold, prompting us all to sit down. "The purpose of this meeting is to make my expectations clear regarding the conduct of the Public Safety Department's personnel regarding certain issues. This stems from last night's arrest of two Firefighters at the public Council meeting for unlawful disruptions of the meeting. Their conduct was unprofessional, and an embarrassment to the Public Safety Department."

Griswold: "Furthermore, there have been public comments made about the Charter Commission's proposal for a new Charter as well as my own proposals for the Public Safety Department. I want to make sure I am clear on the rules and my expectations on that, as well."

Griswold: "First of all, Commander Troy is the Charter Commission Chairman. He has been good about being in civilian attire when attending meetings and speaking of the Charter as the Commission's Chairman, and I expect him to continue to do that. In the capacity of Commission Chairman, I fully expect he's going to discuss it publicly, so most of my comments here don't apply to you, Don."

Griswold: "Having said that, every one of you and every one of your subordinates in the Public Safety Department have your rights to peaceably assemble and of free speech... in a professional manner. If you are opposed to aspects of the Charter, it is your right to be opposed... in a professional manner. If you are going to speak publicly about it, be sure to do so in civilian attire and... in a professional manner."

Griswold: "Actions not in accordance with the law and professional decorum are not acceptable. If members of the Public Safety Department break the law, not only can they be arrested, but they can and likely will be be terminated. I will not tolerate further embarrassment of the kind we had last night."

Griswold: "It is my job as Sheriff to run the Public Safety Department, which includes proposals for the efficient running of the various Departments within it. You and your subordinates may not like my proposals, but there is a point where a line is crossed and it becomes insubordinate to publicly oppose those proposals. If you don't like it, you are free to signify so by raising your hand and saying 'I resign.'. That resignation will be accepted, and then you can go whine about it to the Press all you want."

Griswold: "Last but not least, threats of a strike simply because individuals don't like certain aspects of the proposed Charter are not acceptable. I consider a threat to strike that is not coming from a Union official to be direct insubordination, requiring action in response. The Fire Department persecuted the hell out of the former EMS for going on strike, reminding us that it was illegal, and demanding the EMTs be fired... and they were. But now it's come full circle... if the Fire Department goes on strike over opposition to something the People have voted to institute in the new Charter, that strike will be illegal, and I will be accepting resignations and/or terminating those going on strike."

The Sheriff looked at all of our faces, then said "If there are any questions, now is the time. Once we leave this meeting, you will be expected to hold your peace."

Fire Chief Quinlin said "For the sake of clarification, are you forbidding me from campaigning against the Charter with the full intent to have it defeated so that there is no new EMS?"

"You may campaign all you like," replied the Sheriff, "as long as you are doing so as an individual, as a Citizen, and not in uniform or any clothing showing you're part of the Fire Department."

"I believe that is wrong." said Quinlin. "I believe I have every right to publicly voice my opposition to the EMS <i>as the Fire Chief</i>, and in uniform."

"I totally agree with Chief Quinlin." said Battalion Chief Tucker. "The People have the right to know that we're opposing those provisions of the Charter as the Fire Department Officers we are."

"I don't agree." said Assistant Chief Davies. "Campaigning as a high-ranking Fire Department Officer can be construed as intimidating subordinates to vote your way. I'll say right now that not all, or even a majority, of the Fire Department rank-and-file are as strenuously opposed to the EMS proposals. And the majority are very much in favor of the Battalion Chief position being brought into line with the Superintendents. The Fire Department Captain Union might say one thing, but that does not mean the rank-and-file Fire Department Union is in agreement." 

Quinlin and Tucker were looking hatefully at Davies. Davies and Zoe Singer were scowling at the Fire Chief in return.

"Sheriff," said Beth Paige, the PHO, "I want to point out that there is a distinction between campaigning for or against the Charter, and opposing your proposals to the Council, which might pass regardless of the Charter."

"I don't agree." growled Griswold. "If Quinlin is speaking in uniform publicly or on television, it could be incorrectly construed that he is speaking for the entire Fire Department... and I happen to know and also to agree with Chief Davies that that's not the case. And I'll give the example again: Commander Troy wears civilian attire and makes sure to say he is speaking as Charter Commission Chairman and not as a Police Officer or on behalf of the entire Police Force when he discusses the Charter. <i>That</i> is the example I want followed. Am I clear?"

There was a general nodding of heads, though Quinlin, Tucker, and Carlson looked like they were in anything but agreement. "Anything else?" asked the Sheriff.

"I have a question for Commander Troy." said Fire Chief Quinlin. Looking at me, he angrily said "I want to know why you had my Firefighters arrested and booked, instead of showing some professional courtesy and letting them go once you took them out of there."

"Er... because they broke the law, maybe?" I replied. Some people chuckled; others made their hatred clear on the faces. I continued: "I wasn't there, but I fully support my Captain of Operations and my Police Officers, who acted properly and professionally, and did not discriminate in making arrests of the troublemaking disruptors." Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Fire Marshal Zoe Singer grin at that.

"You were wrong." said the Fire Chief. "You were wrong to do that. Those weren't environmentalist activists, they were Firefighters-------"

"Again, Chief, I support my Police Officers. They took the <i>correct</i> action." I said, staring daggers at the Fire Chief.

"Don't interrupt me again, you insubordinate little shit------" Quinlin erupted. Cindy's hand on my shoulder prevented me from getting up. But the Police Chief was already standing up.

"You don't outrank <i>me</i>, Quinlin." Chief Moynahan thundered. "And you may consider the Commander's words to be mine. I fully support my Captain of Operations and my Officers, as well. They did the correct thing to arrest and fully book your unprofessional Firefighters..." Battalion Chief Tucker stood up, and it looked like he was going to attack Chief Moynahan.

<i>*tap tap tap tap tap tap tap*</i> 

The sound of a red crowbar tapping against the edge of the table began filling the room. I did not even need to stand up nor look up at anyone. Everyone sat back down.

Sheriff Griswold growled "I've made my expectations clear. I expect you and your subordinates to act professionally in all of your actions, but especially on these issues. That's all I have." With that, he and his Deputies got up to leave. We all stood up, as well, but stayed at our places until they were out of the room.

"Hey, you!" Chief Quinlin snarled, coming after me. Battalion Chief Tucker was also coming around the table very fast to confront me. I handed Cindy my crowbar (to make it fair) and turned to confront Quinlin.

"My firefighters are in jail because of you." snarled Quinlin as he drew up to me. "I won't be forgetting that. You better watch your back, Troy."

"I always do." I said.

"And you better watch your mouth with me, <i>Commander.</i>" snarled Quinlin pointing his finger in my face, with Tucker right next to him. A 'disturbance' was imminent.

"You better get your finger out of my face, or I'll break it off." I warned. "And the thing about pulling rank? You better be able to back it up. And you and your little shit-eating poodle here... y'all ain't got what it takes." 

Everyone stood watching, breathlessly wondering what was going to happen. Finally, Battalion Chief Carlson stepped in. "Come on, Chief." he said. Taking the opportunity to extricate himself from something very ugly happening to him, Chief Quinlin allowed himself to be led away. 

"Get out of here, Tucker." said Assistant Fire Chief Davies. "You can't handle the Iron Crowbar."

"And you can?" growled Tucker, about to turn and confront Davies.

"I don't have to." said Davies. "I only have to handle <i>you.</i> Whenever you're ready, bring it on." Tucker made his wisest move of the day. He went for the door and exited the room. 

"Let me know if they give you any crap." I said to Davies. "It's getting ugly now."

As Cindy and I left, she handed me my red crowbar back and said "See what you get for missing Council meetings?"

"The party never stops..." I replied...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

6:00pm, Wednesday, September 11th. Cindy, Teresa, Paulina, and I were sitting on the outside deck of the Cop Bar, having beef nachos and Cherry Coke Zero.

"Nice having a Wednesday night with no Charter meetings." I said. "It was fun while it lasted, but I'm glad it's done."

"You guys did a great job with that, pass or fail." said Paulina. She turned to Cindy and Teresa and asked "Do you guys think it'll pass?"

"Yes." said Teresa. "And that's not just kissing up to the boss, either." We chuckled at that. Then Teresa said "I have a question: if I'm going to be 'Commander of Operations', what does that make <i>you</i>, Don?"

I said "My position is and will continue to be 'Police Commander', but it can also be considered to be 'Chief of Operations' vs. you being 'Commander of Operations', while Cindy's is 'Executive Officer'."

Cindy took it up: "A lot of larger Police Departments have both Assistant Chiefs and Deputy Chiefs, with the Assistant Chiefs above the Deputy Chiefs. When the Sheriff and I wrote up the first draft proposals, we had the Chiefs with three stars, then the Assistant Chiefs with two stars, and the Deputy Chiefs having one star. Don would've been Assistant Police Chief with two stars, while I would've had one."

I said "And I nixed that for three reasons: first, it didn't translate well over all the divisions of the Public Safety Department, particularly with regard to the Fire Marshal; second, what we have now works well, and I don't need to outrank Cindy; and third... well, I like being called 'Commander'."

The women chuckled at that. "Ah, the secret is out." said Teresa with as much of a grin as we were going to get from her. "So, Cindy, do <i>you</i> think it'll pass?"

Cindy said "I think it'll pass, but it might be close. It'll depend on the turnout in the minority districts------"

"Mind if I join you guys?"

The voice belonged Assistant Fire Chief Davies. He'd just come up from the outside ramp.

"Sure!" I said. "Have a seat. You know everyone here. And ranks are off at our parties here." 

Davies said he did know everyone, then said "I almost wish something had happened in that meeting. I'm just itching to beat the crap out of Tucker."

Cindy said "I think Don was going to annihilate him and then turn his attention to Chief Quinlin. Those guys truly are lucky that nothing happened."

"Yes they are." I said. "But it won't be long before Tucker and Carlson are no longer in the same rank category as you and we are. Not that Tucker matters anyway."

"That guy was an ass to me all the time while I was a Superintendent." said Davies. "If you think Quinlin was pulling rank today, he was nothing compared to Tucker. Then when I got promoted to Assistant Fire Chief over him, he acted all friendly-like... until I reminded him I still held grudges against him and was just looking to take him down. And now he's really, really bitter about the rank structure changes."

"Tough shit." I said. "But watch your back around Chief Quinlin. I've got the Sheriff, the Police Chief, and the Power of the Green Crowbar behind my back. I know you can handle yourself, but watch out for that guy."

"I hear ya." said Davies. "I don't know how Fire Marshal Singer does it, but she's pushed back against him for years. But what gets me is... well, when all that crap with the EMS came down, he never really came out against them like a lot of others did. But now... he's bitterly opposed to a new EMS. And he's definitely telling the Fire Department that they'd better toe the line and oppose the new EMS, as well. A lot of our newer guys don't care about that, but when he's openly telling them their careers depend on supporting him against the EMS, it's a bad thing."

"Yeah," said Cindy, "I don't get Chief Quinlin's attitude about it, either. Whassup wit' dat, Don?"

I said "My first instinct is to say 'money'. I think as long as the old EMS was gone, he was okay with the <i>status quo</i>. Maybe he thought he'd eventually get a Fire Rescue unit over time. But when the Sheriff proposed the new EMS, and one totally independent of the Fire Department... yeah, he didn't take too well to that. Not sure why, but his true colors came out on it."

Teresa said "You better get ready to become Fire Chief, Chief Davies. The writing is on the wall for Chief Quinlin if he doesn't get his head out of his ass."

"His head nearly got shoved into his ass today." Cindy said. "Iron Crowbar don't play."

"Neither do the Green Crowbar." I replied.

"Yeah." said Davies. "I'll tell you guys this in confidence: the Sheriff has already met with me, twice. We'll see what happens after the Charter vote------"

He stopped speaking because I had stood up. I was watching out over the parking lot, and had not failed to notice someone in a blue Camry watching us. When they saw that I'd seen them, the car pulled out into the traffic of the street... but not before I got a car tag number.

"QTC 106" I said into my Police iPhone's app. The tag quickly came back. "Hmmm, Harmon Beck. Schoolteacher. Longtime and big-time NEA Union member..."

"And keeping tabs on us." the Green Crowbar said.

"Somebody's about to get an ass whipping." said the Iron Wolf...

<b>Part 3 - The Art of Discipline</b>

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Friday, September 13th, from near the Fire Department Headquarters and Range. "The Public Safety Department has erupted into chaos as opposition to the new Charter plan grows!"

Bettina began: "Judge Harry Nance reduced the bail of two Firefighters arrested during disruptive demonstrations at Tuesday's Town & County Council meeting to $10,000 each, after the Firefighters Union filed an emergency appeal over what they deemed excessive bail of half a million dollars. Commander Donald Troy was not at the Council meeting, and a large contingent of Police, led by Captain Teresa Croyle, <i>who has beat up persons in her custody before</i>, used paramilitary tactics many <i>experts</i> consider to be excessive to arrest the largely peaceful demonstrators."

Bettina: "We have with us Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker, who are strongly opposed to the Charter proposals." The two men appeared with Bettina as the camera panned out, both of them in their Fire Department Duty Dress uniforms "Gentlemen, what are the problems with the Charter proposals?"

"Pure and simple, Bettina," said Chief Quinlin, "they create danger for the Citizens of the Town & County. The proposed new EMTs not being a part of the experienced efficiency of the Fire Department will cost lives. We absolutely do not need an EMS that is not under the full control of the Fire Department, and <i>I am speaking on behalf of the Town & County Fire Department in saying this.</i>"

Bettina turned to Tucker, who said "The new rank structure sows confusion for our firefighters responding to emergencies. Our firefighters don't know who is in charge at the scene and at the fire stations. And it was just a pure power grab on <i>Police</i> Commander Donald Troy's part in writing the Charter to diminish the ranks of the Fire Department relative to the Police Department."

"Thank you both, gentlemen." said Bettina. "It doesn't look like the Fire Department supports the new Charter at all, which is just another failure on <i>Police</i> Commander Donald Troy's part. And now let's go to trusted reporter Lester Holder, with a report on important civil rights issues. Lester!"

"<i>That's right,</i>, Bettina!" said Lester Holder from an 'undisclosed location' that was the backyard of KXTC studios. "Channel Two News has confirmed that the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Justice Department is preparing to indict Town & County Mayor Daniel Allgood for racist actions against blacks, including the suppression of their rights and voices on the Council. The indictments could come as early as next week. The Civil Rights Division is acting in retaliatory response to Mayor Allgood's total lack of cooperation with their investigation of him."

Penis Holder: "And State House Representatives are suspending their investigations into the allegations that <i>deeply unpopular</i> Governor Val Jared violated the rights of persecuted undocumented workers by having SBI-IDE Agents arrest and turn over the undocumented workers to the Federal ICE Bureau, and separating children from their parents as part of the process. The State House Legislators say they are being stonewalled by the racist Jared Regime, but will take the matter up when the Legislature meets again in January, and they can issue subpoenas to appear at their Committee hearings. Back to you, Bettina!"

"Thank you, Lester, for that information that people need to know." said Bettina. "And now let's go to Sports with Jeff Hull. Jeff!"

"Thank you, Bettina!" said Jeff Hull. "The Bulldogs face State U. in a tough Conference game, while the Wildcats will host Protestant, also a Conference contest. Wildcats tailback Clarence Appletree could add to his impressive rushing statistics and garner further Heisman consideration with a big day against the Protestant defense..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

We drank coffee in silence in the Chief's Conference Room, wondering what Our Sheriff was going to do about the blatant Fire Department insubordination. After a moment, he got up and said "If you'll excuse me, I have work to do. Commander Ross, I will need to borrow Lt. Myron Milton for a few moments."

"Yes sir." said Cindy. She made a text as Sheriff Griswold left the room.

"What do you think he's going to do?" asked Teresa quietly.

"I'll tell you, but it stays in this room." said Chief Moynahan. "The Sheriff is going to quietly build his case until after the Charter vote on September 24th. And the day after, he is going to bring up Chief Quinlin on charges, and have him fired. No pension, no compensation."

"He's not going to relieve him now, sir?" Tanya asked, somewhat incredulously.

"Noooo." drawled the Chief. "The Press will raise hell in a coordinated attack if he does, which the Sheriff sees is the real issue here. If the Sheriff acts, Quinlin will grieve it to the Union, raising issues of Free Speech and suppression of it, as well as bring negative publicity over the EMS isssssue. Quinlin may even be banking on the Press drama and the chaos to help defeat the Charter proposals, which is his true lodestone."

"What if they go after Davies?" I asked. "Which is what I think is going to happen."

"I don't knowwwww." drawled the Chief. 

"That would give the Sheriff an excuse to fire Chief Quinlin," said Teresa, "without it being about the EMS."

"I'm not so much worried about Quinlin going after Davies." I replied. "Fire Marshal Singer would take that right up to the I.G. I'm worried about what the Union will try to do to Davies."

"I know it's an internecine battle." said Tanya. "But would the Fire Department Captain's Union really go after Davies like that?"

"Ohhhhh, I get it." said Cindy, with tremendous insight. "Don doesn't mean the Fire Department Union... <i>he means the NEA, the powerful Teachers Union!</i>"

"Somebody give that woman a crowbar!" I exclaimed happily. "Oh.. she already has one. Never mind..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<i>*Whirrrrrrrr*</i>

Captain of Detectives Tanya Perlman drove into my office at 9:00am. "Sir," she said, "You wanted me to assign a liaison to FBI ASAC Karina White regarding the Blassingame jury tampering case?"

"Yes." I said. "Who do you recommend?"

"It's egregious enough to be an MCD case." Tanya said. "My first thought is Joanne Warner, who has the clearance and the FBI Consultant credentials to work with the FBI on it. And she's pregnant, so this is something she can largely do while sitting at her desk."

"Not Sonali or Lainie?" I asked.

"Well..." Tanya said, then started in: "They're support. Until we get an Intelligence Division, if we get one, they're there to help the Detectives."

"True." I said. "And I agree with you about Joanne. Tell Lt. Davis to assign it to her."

"Yes sir." Tanya said. "And... can I ask you one more thing, sir?"

"Yes, of course." I said.

"This business about Councilman Lewis wanting to disperse the Detectives to Precincts." Tanya said. "Is he really going after us on that? And is he still trying to force us to have three precincts, or has he given up on that for now?"

"I like it that you said 'for now'." I replied with a wan smile. "Because I think that's the case. But yes, he's switched gears, and is now pushing hard to disperse the Detectives. I think that's aimed squarely at me."

"Is there a realistic chance of it happening?" Tanya asked.

"Dispersing the Detectives? No." I said. "The Sheriff has already stated that it's his pervue on how to deploy his Police and Fire assets, and that the Council does not have the power to usurp it. And the new Charter reinforces that. It is <i>good</i> to be the Charter Commission Chairman."

"And precincts?" Tanya asked, perhaps as a 'gotcha' question.

"We studied that during the Charter-writing process." I said. "And let me put it this way: you see a TCPD cruiser on the road. What precinct is it from?"

"Uh..." Tanya said, then caught on. "You can't tell. We don't mark them that way."

"Exactly." I said. "The point being that we can have a Precinct Station, and we can patrols based out of those physical locations... but we can have Patrols driving around anywhere."

"So why does Lewis keep pushing so hard for more precincts?" asked Tanya. "And especially dispersing Detectives to them?"

"You were asking him that when he made that gender slur to you." I said. "And he knows he can't legitimately answer it, and he won't say his real reasons out loud... which are to harm the Police Force, demoralize our Officers, and thus weaken our ability to enforce the law."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

11:30am, Friday the 13th of September. I met Jack at the Cop Bar. As usual, he had the Double Cheeseburger Plate, and I had the Double Breakfast Burger (bacon and fried egg added) Plate.

As we ate, Muscone said "This thing with Allgood is serious. They tried to get a warrant to arrest him. They were going to bring in stormtroopers to batter down his door at 5:00am, with KXTC and KSB there to film the perp walk, and a bunch of blacks there to chant 'lock him up, lock him up'."

"I wonder how many Melina would've killed if they'd tried that." I said. "The stormtroopers, I mean.

"A lot, but they would've just murdered them both.. and their children." said Muscone. "What saved them was that Judge K.M. Landis rejected the warrant request, saying there was insufficient evidence to make an arrest. He also said that it was rightfully a civil complaint, and all they could do was subpoena him, not arrest him."

"They didn't go to Taney for the warrant?" I asked.

"No, they shot their wad on that when they tried using her to get Peter Blassingame out of prison. She was told by Landis and other superiors... maybe even a U.S. Supreme Court Justice... to be very careful about 'going out of turn' on things like that. Thankfully, Landis is an honest judge and doesn't brook much of the Swamp's shit."

"Does Melina know about this?" I asked.

"Yes." said Muscone. "She's the one that got wind of it and had Mike Todd intervene to Judge Landis. And Mike Todd and Cy Hart are on retainer from the legal defense fund that was set up for Daniel. The US DOJ has a fight on their hands if they pursue this."

"Is Jocelyn Moran pushing this?" I asked, remembering her earlier attacks upon the Mayor. (<i>Author's note: 'Casting Aspersions'</i>)

"Maybe from Washington." Muscone said. "And that reminds me: our FBI investigation of her was stopped. Just stopped cold. And when Senator Bill Nunn inquired as to why it was stopped, he was told to, and I quote, 'fuck off'. Yes, they told a U.S. Senator to fuck off, and other Senators, both Democrat and Establishment Republican, backed the DOJ up and told Nunn to back off or he'd end up dead in a garbage dumpster."

"Wow." I said.

"Fortunately, Nunn isn't married nor has kids." said Muscone. "They forced U.S. Congressman Gowron to announce he wasn't running for his seat again, by threatening his family, but that hasn't worked on Nunn so far. Still, the fact they're threatening his life shows how far they're willing to go to protect Moran."

"Wow." I said. "And they're turning all that Federal power on Mayor Allgood? Just for not allowing his rightful win as Mayor to be stolen from him?"

"Well," said Muscone, "I think we all know there's a lot more to it. But their first two salvos have been stopped, and they have a very dangerous enemy in the Mayor's wife. By the way, if the Mayor were to vacate his office via resignation, removal, or, perish forbid, death, who replaces him?"

"No one, as of right now." I said. "The senior Council Member would run the Council meetings, but it would be just the ten people. They'd have to agree, or at least have a majority vote, to call a special election, but there is no requirement to call one. The new Charter will have the Inspector General, then the Sheriff, be the Acting Mayor. And the Council will be required to call a special election if the vacancy occurs four months or more before the next normal election day of the Mayor position."

"So if no one is Mayor," said Muscone, "the Council is hamstrung."

"When they're evenly divided like they are now, yes." I said. "But it's pretty fluid... Weston and Sorrells don't always vote in <i>jackbooted lockstep</i> with Carnes, Lewis, and Adams. And the Council Republicans are normally pretty tight, but every so often one or more of them peel off from the expected norm."

Muscone thought about it as he finished off his double cheeseburger. Then he said "All that Federal power directed at one local Mayor. I just don't get it. There's got to be more to it. The only thing I can see is that they're trying to get rid of <i>you</i>, by altering the balance of power on the Council. If Eldrick X. Weaver had won the election, or if Allgood is removed and replaced, then they could vote to terminate you."

"Well," I said, "first of all, both the old and new Charters say that Medal of Valor recipients have the right to retire with at least half-pay as pension, and nothing can take that away, not even conviction of felony crimes. So I would always have the right to retire. And if they do want to force that retirement, it would be a tough slog: they'd have to prove a crime or malfeasance, then get past the Union grievances and my lawsuits."

I continued: "And it would be no guarantee they'd remove me, anyway. If Weaver had won last November, I'm not sure at all that the 5-5 balance the Council has now would be that way. Weston and even Sorrells are not the militantly far-left Democrats that Lewis and Adams are. And Carnes is just a hate-filled bitch, but she's also white and represents the wealthiest districts in the County. Look at her reaction to the School Board revenue distribution plan: she's bitterly opposed to it while Lewis and Adams are for it. And if Weaver were Mayor and was trying to push policies to favor blacks? Noooo guarantees he would have Carnes's support at all."

"Hmm, interesting." said Muscone. "So why the DOJ hatred for Allgood? What are your ideas?"

I said "As near as I can figure, it's because he won and dared to defy those who tried to steal the election from him. They hate him immeasurably for it, and they hate the people that voted for him just as badly. They hate me for daring to arrest and prosecute the woman that tried to steal the election on Weaver's behalf. They hate Rodney K. Watts for ruling in Allgood's favor; they especially hate him as an 'Uncle Tom' and a 'tool of The Man'.

"What it boils down to," I finished, "is that they want to teach all of us an unforgettable lesson that standing in their way will cause us to be crushed with as much power as they can bring to bear against us..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I don't know what I liked less: all the Bulldog Blue flying about as people came in for the next day's game... or the nearly offensive shade of purple exhibited by the visiting State U. Purple Hawks fans. State U. was the Wildcats's in-State archrival. And since many Bulldogs fans regarded the Wildcats as more of an enemy than State Tech, giving the schools a common enemy in the Wildcats, this was almost a 'friendly' rivalry game.

So rather than go to the extremely crowded Cop Bar, I hosted a party at The Cabin. The Usual Suspects were there, and their various parents were, as well. Daniel and Melina brought Daniel and Patricia. Daniel loved getting to play with his brother Douglass and his cousins and 'steps', and Patricia, Tasha, Carole, and Marie were having fun doing their things, including petting Bowser and Buddy. I strongly suspected Patricia would be asking her parents for a dog in the near future.

Todd, Cindy, and Daniel were talking Bulldogs football in the front room, which included making the most disparaging of comments about the Wildcats. The Wildcats at the party (Melina and myself) plotted retribution for after the October 26th Wildcat victory over the Bulldogs (so we hoped). 

As the sun set, Sheriff Griswold, Mayor Allgood, and I went out onto the back deck, where I'd started a fire in the fire pot. I sat in my usual place, and the Sheriff sat in the chair to my left, and Daniel in the chair by the table to my right. I'd poured Scotch for me and bourbons for Griswold and Daniel.

"So what did you do about Fire Chief Quinlin, Sheriff?" asked Daniel.

"Nothing... yet." Griswold growled. "I'm just giving him rope to hang himself with, and he's fashioning the noose as we speak."

Daniel asked "Do you guys think the whole Fire Department is against the new Charter?"

"No. I said. "They've hired a lot of new guys since the EMS was dissolved. Those new guys don't really care about it. But the ones that still do are the older ones, the ones in the leadership positions. So I don't think you'll see a massive vote against the Charter by the TCFD, but the aftermath might get... ugly."

"Don't worry about that, Crowbar." said the Sheriff. "I've got people making their lists and checking them twice." I nodded.

"There's something else I want to talk to both of you about." said Daniel Allgood. "Now don't get me wrong; I intend to fight the US DOJ like hell and to the last ditch. And I have no problem putting Lewis and Carnes in their places when they call me an illegitimate Mayor. That's not just an insult to me, but to every Voter who voted for me."

"But I have to admit," continued the Mayor, "it's exhausting. And it's no fun, at all. It's affecting J.P. Goldman's health beyond that ipecac attack on him," (<i>Author's note: 'Casting Aspersions', Ch. 02.</i>) "And Mr. Goldman, who is one of the nicest men I've ever met, is now as hate-filled as Kelly Carnes, and won't compromise an inch with her, Lewis, and Adams anymore. And for that matter, no one is compromising on anything. I think Susan Weston and Sheila Sorrells are pretty pragmatic, but with Mr. Goldman, Ian McGhillie, and Edward Steele not meeting them halfway, they don't have any choice but to side with the hardcore Haters, Carnes, Lewis, and Adams."

"You're not going to quit, are you?" growled the Sheriff, and his voice connoted how disappointed, and more, he would be if Allgood gave up the fight.

"No, Sheriff." said Daniel. "I'll finish out my term. But I may not run again. I'm not saying that for sure, just letting you both know that I'm thinking about it, and Melina and I are talking about it."

"Well, consider this as you think about it." I said. "Kelly Carnes is under indictment for money laundering and campaign finance law violations. Reginald B.F. Lewis didn't announce he won't run again as I expected him to, but he may just be waiting until after the Charter vote. And I'll say it out loud that I intend to be working behind the scenes to get Lewis or his replacement, Carnes or her replacement, and Malinda Adams defeated and off the Council at the next Election. Once they're gone, it should be a lot simpler for you... and a lot more fun."

"Let's see what happens," said Allgood, "and I'll let you know what I'm going to do. I still have time to decide. Okay, I better get back inside before Carole recruits Patricia to the Wildcat side."

"Too late." I said. "But Carole thinks Dan will be a Bulldog, so you're good there."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
We all got up and shook hands, and Daniel went inside. The Sheriff and I sat back down, and I poured another round for each of us.

"I don't want him quitting on us now," growled Griswold, "but I don't blame him for not wanting to run again. They have put him through no end of hell, and it's just the beginning. I've gotten word from my sources that the US DOJ is seriously going to go after him with everything they can muster."

"Yes sir." I said. "Mike Todd and Cy Hart have been prepping hard for it."

"So who are you going to have run for Mayor in his place?" growled the Sheriff.

"What makes you think I'm going to be the one to get someone to run?" I asked with a grin.

The Sheriff just peered at me, then said "Crowbar... I am not an Agency of the Weak Minded." I began laughing and could not stop...

<b>Part 4 - Ratcheting Up The Heat</b>

On Saturday September 14th, the Bulldogs achieved an upset overtime win over the State U. Purple Hawks, 27-24. The hopes of the entire Bulldogs Nation soared, and the anticipation of the Wildcats game reached an 'unhealthy' (for me) level.

What the Wildcats did to Protestant was not very nice. Clarence Appletree had 335 yards at the end of the third quarter, and was pulled. Jamaal Washington had six catches for <i>three hundred</i> yards. His 'yards after catch' nearly set a record. The Wildcats were playing Freshman walk-ons most of the second half, and still won 76-0. The Wildcat Band played <i>Seventy-six Trombones.</i>

Now, Sunday, September 15th, the boys, Edward Steele, and I were watching an NFL football game. The Atlanta Falcons scored with a minute left to take a one point lead over the Kansas City Chiefs. Rather than kick the extra point or just down the ball, the Falcons coaches went for two, ostensibly to make it a 3-point game. This is what the 'consensus opinion' says... but these were the Atlanta Falcons.

Instead of running the ball, they passed. The Kansas City safety intercepted and ran the ball back the length of the field for two points, giving the Chiefs the one-point lead, which they converted into the win. Yet another humiliation for the Atlanta Falcons. (<i>Author's note: that really did happen.</i>)

"Daddy, have you ever been to Atlanta?" Jim asked.

"Yes, I was there just last year." I said. (<i>Author's note: 'Four Square', Ch. 03.</i>)

"Is Atlanta a bad town?" Jim asked.

"No, it's a very nice city." I said.

"So why does Atlanta have to have the Falcons?" asked Jim. "That's real humiliating."

"Yes, it is." I said. "I feel sorry for the people of Atlanta. At least the Cleveland Browns have a bulldog for their mascot. The Falcons are just losers."

As we waited for the next game to start, a local commercial ran. It showed Fire Chief Quinlin, in his Duty Dress uniform, saying "As Fire Chief, I'm opposed to the new Charter. It hurts the Fire Department, and it puts people's lives at risk with the creation of an unsupervised, uncontrolled EMS. I urge you to vote against the new Charter." A voiceover then said "Vote 'NO' on September 24th. The small print said the ad was paid for by the Fire Department Captain's Union. Edward and I just looked at each other.

As we watched the next game, where the Dallas Cowboys were pummeling the Philadelphia Eagles, Ross asked "Daddy, have you ever been to Dallas?"

"Yes." I said. "Mr. Steele and I were in that stadium when the Wildcats won their first national championship, and Mr. Steele knows the Cowboys owner, Jerry Jones." (<i>Author's note: 'Hampered In His Plans', Ch. 01.</i>)

"Wowwwww!" said Jim and Ross together. That peaked their interest in the stadium and the game. And then another local ad came on:

"The new Charter is unfair to our residents and our children." said the woman's voiceover, showing sad white children. "You are going to be highly taxed, and those tax dollars will be sent to other districts, while <i>your</i> children get less." A huge 'NO!" appeared on the screen. The boilerplate said that the ad was sponsored by the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Okay," Edward Steele said as he and I sat in my office room in The Cabin, "there was no money budgeted for the Charter Commission to run ads. Our expenses were paid for out of the General Fund, and there was money allocated to hold the plebiscite on September 24th. But no money to buy ads."

"I never even thought about that." I said, somewhat forlornly, knowing this was my mistake. "I didn't think we'd have to run ads."

"You're not a politician, and I say that as a compliment." said Steele. "I was the one that should've been aware of it." After a pause, he said "I checked with my campaign people. I legally can run pro-Charter ads, but I don't have a ton of money in the coffers for my own campaign... which is more important than ever with the Council situation the way it is."

"While you were checking with your people," I said, "I was making some phone calls, too. My usual marked cards, The Friends of the Town & County, which is run by Myrtle L. James and Judge Lorraine McGill, have declared their 'neutrality' in the Charter vote. In truth, they and the Business Interests are getting more and more interested in separating the Town and County."

Edward said "Both the Republican and Democrat Parties in the County are also staying out of the way of the Charter vote, too. It's too bad we don't have activists like George Schwartz, who financially backs every little Social Justice group... or should I say 'Socialist Injustice' group. It'd be great if that 'R.C. Christian' guy sponsored a few ads."

"Which might be illegal." I said. "I'm trying like hell to bust Kelly Carnes for that, so I can't be a hypocrite about it right now."

"There's two things we might can do." Edward said, after thinking about it for a moment. "First, we can ask J.P. Goldman to sponsor an ad buy. He's got more money in his PAC, he also has personal wealth he can use to run his next campaign, and he's still bitterly angry about that ipecac attack on him."

"That's a good idea." I said. "What's the other?"

"To get private funding." said Edward. "Someone like your nephew, though mind you I'm not asking you to ask him. But someone who supports the Charter and is willing to run some ads."

"Why don't you call J.P. Goldman." I said. "I'll make an ad, and if I can get Roy Easley to make it with me, that'll go a long way."

"Easley can't wear his uniform, though, and neither can you" said Steele."

"You're right." I said "But we <i>can</i> wear our Medals of Valor..."

<i>*BRING!* *BRING!* *BRING!* *BRING!*</i>

It was my personal iPhone. I took the call...

Assistant Fire Chief Warren Davies and his fiancée Tina Felton of the Women's Law Firm of Dewey, Burnham & Winn left the Sunday evening Mass at the Catholic Church. Davies looked around warily as he opened the shotgun-side door for Tina, then closed it after she got in and went around to the drivers-side door.

As he pulled out onto College Avenue, he observed that a car was following him at a distance. He turned right onto Riverside Drive, going north, then onto North Street. The car that had seemed to be following him was no longer doing so, and he breathed a sigh of relief.

"What's wrong?" Tina asked, seeing Davies's tension.

"With everything going on," he said, "Commander Troy said to really be careful. He said to watch for people following me, take different routes home, and all that."

"He should practice what he preaches." said Tina. "He got ambushed in his SUV."

"Yeah, at the one choke point on his way home." said Davies. He turned onto Cone Street, then onto Rivercrest Road, getting near home.

And then it happened! A car came barreling down the road right at him! As he hit the brakes, two more cars were coming up from behind, and one from out of a nearby driveway. He was surrounded!

"Get 'em!" yelled one of the men that poured out of the cars. One man ran up and swung a tire iron at the drivers's side window, shattering it. Two men reached inside, one going for Davies's neck while the other unlocked the door and force it open. On the other side, once the door unlocked, two men pulled it open and grabbed Tina to pull her out.

"Give it to 'em!" the leader of the men ordered, as Davies was knocked to the ground and Tina's blouse was ripped open...

<b>Part 5 - War</b>

A perp raised his tire iron, ready to smash Davies's head. He swung down...

<b>*CLANG!*</b>

The blow was intercepted... by a red crowbar. The man looked up into the gray eyes of Your Iron Crowbar, and what he saw was frightening to any lawbreaker. I smashed my fist into his belly, then as he doubled over...

<b>*WHAM!*</b>

... my red crowbar came down hard on his back, Then I turned to one of the other men trying to hold down Davies. I swung again, catching him on the shoulder. Lucky for him... I'd been swinging for his head.

<b>*WHAM!*</b>

As I began tearing apart the thugs, Cindy was on the other side of the car, and she was not sparing the rod... er, crowbar, on the men that were assaulting Tina. Cindy did catch one guy in the face, and though his forearm partially caught the blow, his nose was smashed in.

"Let's get out of here!" one man yelled out, but that was stymied as marked and unmarked TCPD cars came flying up, blue LED lights blazing. Officers poured out of the cars, but held back until Cindy and I were finished.

"I give up! I surrender!" one man said, going to his knees with his hands up. I threw a haymaker right in his face, feeling his nose collapse against my fist as I solidly connected. The guy fell back to the ground.

"I'm not accepting surrenders, thug." I growled, my voice gravelly. Unfortunately, Lt. Rudistan led the Officers in to take custody of the thugs before something really bad happened to them as Cindy and Officer Joan Laurer tended to Tina...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

12:00 midnight, becoming Monday, September 16th. I came into my office, followed by Cindy and Paulina Patterson. I was surprised to see a fresh pot of coffee waiting for us.

"I deduce that Lt. Jerome Davis is here." I said. Cindy nodded as she poured us all mugs of the most very needed beverage.

It'd been a busy evening. We'd barely gotten the perps through booking when an NEA lawyer, wearing a $5000 suit, who had a bulldog thug face that Chief IV might love but even the man's mother wouldn't, came in demanding to speak to his clients before we talked with them. By the time he was done, every one of the perps were taking the Fifth.

But I had used the time wisely, and at 10:00pm, the perps were hauled into Night Court. Judge Rodney K. Watts had come in, and despite the protestations of the NEA lawyer, he denied the perps bail on charges of assaulting a County Fire Officer, attempted rape, assaulting Police Officers, resisting arrest, and for some, violating their bail. All six of them had been arrested at the public Council meeting just days before, and released by Judge Harry 'Spud' Nance.

And speaking of Judge Nance: he had come in, possibly alerted by his NEA cronies, but he was too late, and he was visibly furious that Watts was there already. He was about to raise Cain, but it was possible that a green crowbar had blocked his path, and the look in the ice blue eyes of the platinum blonde holding that crowbar bespoke a strong desire to cause Nance pain. 

But he only backed off when his cellphone rang and I said "Answer it." It was Judge Folsom, the chief judge, who ordered Nance to back off. Nance left, his face a mask of utter fury. I made a joke about his face freezing into that look, which did not help his mood very much.

Back in the present, I said "Okay, every one of these bozos were arrested at the Council meeting. All of them have current or previous membership in the NEA. Can we go after the NEA itself, call them a domestic terrorist organization?"

"Probably not." Paulina replied. "We'd have to prove someone in the NEA's leadership sent them to do it. If you can put together a money trail, that would go a long way towards it, but it'd still be a tough sell."

"Yeah," I said, "but I'd love to do it, just for the publicity and to make them have to defend their actions. Anyway, these guys are denied bail, and the charges are serious. By the way, how's Tina?"

"She'll be okay... I think." said Cindy. "She gave her statement to Julia Rodriguez pretty calmly, and we have it on videotape. We let her go home, but she'll be talking to Laura tomorrow. Davies was checked out for a concussion from when they slammed his head to the street, but he appears to be okay. We got there before they could do too much to him. He's angry more than anything else."

"How did you guys know to be there?" Paulina asked. 

Cindy and I gave each other a 'look', then I said with a grin: "I'm not sure we should tell someone in the District Attorney's Office." It was Paulina's turn to give us a 'look'.

"Okay." I said with some amusement. "The other day at the Cop Bar, Davies was at our table on the outside deck when I noticed some people in a car watching us. I got the tag number of the car, and it was one of those six bozos that are polluting my jails now. So we knew that they were watching us, and it occurred to me that it might be Davies they were following."

"So they thought he was the easy target?" Paulina asked.

"Maybe." I said. "I'm sure they knew that if they'd taken on the Green Crowbar, they would've gotten hurt far worse than they did tonight. Anyhoo, Teresa had a second shift plainclothes patrol in an unmarked car follow Davies around, and she herself followed him from the Catholic Church. When they saw something suspicious, they called it in, and Cindy and I were sitting in the neighborhood, waiting for them to arrive. The perps attacked almost directly in front of us, and the rest was easy."

Cindy said "And I'm sure they'll think twice about attacking Davies or Zoe Singer again, seeing how fast our reaction was to the attack on Davies tonight. They've got protection from Deputies and loyal Firefighters now."

Paulina asked "Why were the NEA's thugs attacking Davies, though? I'd think they'd concentrate on someone else, like pro-Charter teachers. Is Chief Quinlin part of it?"

I said "Under the 'the enemy of my enemy is my friend' concept? Maybe, but I don't think it's Quinlin. He's opposed to the new EMS, but to <i>that</i> level?"

Cindy said "I understand what you're saying, but Chief Quinlin has been getting more and more arrogant, lately. He went after you in that meeting, he's making those ads in clear defiance of County ordinances and the Sheriff's explicit instructions, and he's basically acting like he's desperate."

"True." I said "But I'm thinking of the more likely possibility: the Battalion Chiefs, especially Tucker. Would <i>he</i> work with the NEA to use violent means to stop the new Charter, and what he sees as his own demotion? You betcha."

"Well, we're not going to solve it tonight." said Paulina, getting up. "I'll see you guys in the morning."

"Give me a second, and I'll walk you out." I said. I gave instructions to take the perps to County Jail and put them in isolation where they could not communicate with each other. I told everyone I could find who was not on 3d shift to go home. Then I escorted Paulina out, and followed her home to make sure all was well with her...

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Monday, September 16th, from the roof of the building on College and Riverside, with Police Headquarters in the background. "Channel Two News has learned that some of the protesters at last week's public Council meeting were re-arrested and jailed without bail!"

Bettina began: "Six persons were arrested last night after they allegedly assaulted Assistant Fire Chief Warren Davies. As these arrest photos show, they were severely beaten by Police Commander Donald Troy and other Police Officers at the scene." The mug shots were shown, and yes, it was obvious some of the perps had been on the losing end of the personal combat that had taken place the night before. "One of the arrested suspects said that he attempted to surrender to authorities, but was punched in the face by Commander Donald Troy while he, the suspect, was in a helpless position."

"The NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union, has demanded that Commander Troy be suspended without pay pending an investigation by the FBI and SBI." Bettina continued. "The NEA spokesperson also said that this Police brutality was out of frustration that the <i>deeply unpopular</i> new Charter is headed to certain defeat because of NEA and teachers's opposition to it."

Bettina: "And the pro-Charter group 'Citizens For Children's Education' filed a complaint with the FEC and State Election Authority over Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker appearing in a political advertisement in uniform, which violates County ordinances. They have called upon Sheriff Griswold to suspend the two Fire Officers. And now let's go to <i>trusted</i> political reporter Lester Holder for the latest news about illegitimate Mayor Daniel Allgood. Lester!"

"<i>That's right</i>, Bettina!" said Lester Holder, coming onto the screen from the same rooftop Bettina was on, but with City Hall behind him. "Channel Two News has learned that lawyers for Mayor Allgood have rebuffed a settlement offer by the U.S. DOJ Civil Rights Division, saying that the Mayor has done nothing wrong, and not only expects but demands his day in Court to battle the charges of racism being leveled against him. Civil rights <i>experts</i> say that the Mayor should have taken the generous offer of a settlement, as it is extremely likely that he will be convicted in the Court trial for racist actions against Council Member Reginald B.F. Lewis. And now let's go to Jeff Hull with Sports. Jeff!"

"Thank you, Lester." said Jeff Hull, perhaps not all that enthusiastically. "The Wildcats find themselves in familiar territory in the new polls, at No. 2, behind only No. 1 Alabama. Our University Bulldogs slipped from 10th to 12th place after a close overtime win against State U., with the Florida Gators and Ole Miss Rebels moving ahead of them..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"What?" asked Cindy Ross as we drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room. "No 'Commander Troy refused requests for comment'? Whassup wit' DAT?"

"Fact izzzzz," drawled Chief Moynahan, "I had Captain Thompson call all the networks to say I wanted to go on air with a comment about the so-called Police brutality of those suspects. It was KXTC that could not be reached for a replyyyyy. I'll be on with KFXU during their 8:00am news report."

"Wouldn't do well for KXTC's narrative of Police brutality if the Police Chief is refuting it." I said.

"I noticed KXTC didn't discuss any polling data." Teresa Croyle said. "<i>It is possible</i> that's because the polling favors the Charter. At least Todd's polling does."

"So who is this 'Citizens for Children's Education' group?" asked Tanya Perlman.

I replied: "From what I hear, it's a teachers and parents group that is pro-Charter. They formed last week to oppose the NEA, which has been pressuring, harassing, and threatening teachers if they don't come out in strong opposition to the Charter."

"The NEA is getting desperate." said Tanya. "Trying to rough up the Assistant Fire Chief?"

"Worse than that." Cindy said levelly. "They were going to rape Tina Felton last night if we hadn't have gotten there in time. As far as I'm concerned... they've crossed the line. I'm not pulling my punches anymore, if the NEA is involved."

"Do <i>not</i> say that publicly, Commander Ross." admonished the Chief. "I'll have no problem refuting this Police brutality business... unless comments like those, however true, are allowed to be heard in public, especially by the Media..."

"Yes sir." said Cindy.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Hello and welcome!" said Catrina Pierce at 8:00am from the Fox Eight News studios. "I'm Catrina Pierce, and with me as always is Meredith Peller. Good morning, Meredith. How was your weekend?"

"My weekend was very good, Catrina." said Meredith. "And yours?"

"It was great." said Catrina. "Some great football games, and an upcoming vote on the new Charter. So what is the news this morning?"

Meredith said "Police arrested six men who attacked Assistant Fire Chief Warren Davies and his fiancée last night. Chief Davies was slightly injured and the perps attempted to rape his fiancée, but were stopped in time by the arrival of the TCPD."

Catrina: "Reports are that Police Commander Donald Troy and Deputy Police Chief Cindy Ross arrived at the scene and did not draw their guns in the suburban neighborhood, but engaged the perps in personal combat. The perps resisted arrest and assaulted the Police Officers, but despite the six-to-two odds, the Officers prevailed. Other Police Officers arrived and arrested the perps and took them to Police Headquarters for booking."

Meredith: "Judge Rodney K. Watts took the unusual step of opening his Court for a night hearing for the six arrested men. All six had been arrested at the previous week's public Town & County Council meeting, and had been released on their own recognizance in lieu of bail by Judge Harry Nance. This time, however, Judge Watts ordered all six to be held with no bail. All six have ties to the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union, and the NEA has protested the treatment of the perps."

Catrina: "The NEA, which is providing legal representation for the six suspects, said that the Police exercised excessive use of force and brutality against the suspects. We have here with us Police Chief Sean Moynahan to address that. Welcome, Chief!" 

"Good morning, Meredith. Good morning, Catrina." said a smiling Chief Moynahan.

"Chief, in the interests of fair and balanced coverage," said Catrina, "we're showing the mug shots of the six perps taken at their booking last night. They definitely lost the fight. Was this excessive by your Officers?"

"Noooo, Catrina." said the Chief. "Commanders Troy and Ross are very good at evaluating situations, and saw that the use of guns in that neighborhood constituted a potential danger to the innocent residents as well as Chief Davies and his fiancée. So even though they were facing six-to-two odds, they stopped the perps's assault with their tremendous martial-arts skills, and of course their crowbarrrrrrs. I do not bee-leeeeeve this was excessive use of force, but adequate force without using the lethal force of their service weapons."

Meredith: "Chief, Police reports say that all six suspects have ties to the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union. Is the NEA acting like a domestic terrorist group?"

"We are still working on tying these men to the NEA," said the Chief, "and determining if the NEA was behind the attacks. As that investigation is on-go-innnng, I'll refrain from further comment on the case..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"He's good." said Your Iron Crowbar as my Angels and I watched in my office in prelude to the Angels Meeting. "Verrrry good."

"Think that'll restore our useless reputations?" Cindy asked, meaning it humorously.

"Not if KXTC can 'heppit'." I replied. "And seriously, I won't be surprised if the Board of Inquiry gets its last hurrah with this case."

"If the new Charter fails," said Teresa Croyle, "God help us on all the Boards of Inquiry they're going to force upon us."

"The Boards aren't the problem." I replied. "Finneran is the problem. If the new Charter fails, the Mayor is going to assert his power under the 'old rules' to force Finneran off the BOIs. It'll be an ugly fight, though."

"<i>What</i> Mayor?" asked Teresa. "They're doing everything they can to destroy Daniel."

"That's Iron Crowbar thinking, there." I said, pointing at Teresa in acknowledgement.

"And what's more," Tanya Perlman said, "Jack told me that the so-called 'settlement' would have required Daniel to resign as Mayor. Of course he refused to do that."

Teresa said "The DOJ's tactics are nothing short of a Mob shakedown."

"And that's why Jocelyn Moran was pulled from it." Tanya replied. "She's been accused of shaking down corporations with allegations of racism, making them pay the Government millions in so-called settlements. Some companies, like Nike, have told the DOJ to go to hell, but others settle rather than be bankrupted by the legal costs and the negative publicity."

"And they didn't expect Daniel to have the resources to fight them." I said. "But his legal defense fund was crowdfunded, or whatever the term is, and Mike G. Todd and Cy Hart are actually enjoying ripping the DOJ's lawyers new ones in Court." 

Then, with a massively wicked grin, I said "They say it's as easy as what the Wildcats are going to do to the Bulldogs on October 26th!" Tanya and Teresa did not try to hold back on their laughter nor hide their amusement. Cindy, by way of contrast, had cold fire coming from her ice-blue peepers.

"Keep talking." the Green Crowbar replied. "After we stuff Clarence Appletree and kill his Heisman chances forever, we'll have Chief IV in for another victory lap around the Police Headquarters gym."

"And when Appletree or Washington wins that Heisman," I said, "I'm going to make you take a picture with it."

"Make me?" Cindy almost gasped. "You and whose army?"

"The Iron Army!" I said. "Iron Crowbar, Iron Wolf, Lady Ironside..." Teresa and Tanya high-fived through their laughter.

"Well!" Cindy said in mock exasperation as she stood up, "unlike your Iron Army twiddling your thumbs in here, I have work to do." I refrained from a biting reply as Cindy pranced to the door and exited the office.

"O-kayyyyyy, let's twiddle our thumbs running this Police Department." I said. "Whaddya got?"

Tanya said "Midtown PD called me just before this meeting. They're moving in on Cochise and the China One Car Shop. At least two of the high-class cars stolen up here are believed to have gone through his shop."

"Cochise's joint was not known as a chop shop." I said. "Though as a pass-through for the high-end stuff, I can see. Does Midtown PD have pictures?"

"It is possible that they do." said Tanya. "They didn't say any more on the phone."

"Who are you sending down there?" I asked.

"Roy McGhillie and Christopher Purvis were working on the car thefts up here." said Tanya. "But I was thinking of sending Roy with Julia Rodriguez or Theo Washington instead."

"Why not Purvis?" asked Teresa. "I'm asking for a friend, of course."

Tanya said "They don't call him 'Chris Pervert' for nothing. He's a good Detective, but he's quirky. I'm not sure he's the one we want MPD to be seeing in a cooperative exercise."

"And maybe you want Purvis to be in your new Intelligence Division, perhaps as the Senior Detective?" I asked with a 'knowing' look.

"Why, what an extraordinary thought, sir!" Tanya said with mock asskissing joviality. "That is certainly something worth consideration." Teresa was trying hard not to laugh, and she was failing.

"All right." I said. "But I want to go down there with them."

Just then there was a knock on the door, and Cindy looked in. "Go to PDTV2. You've got to see the ad they're running."

PDTV2 was internal Police Channel 2. I turned on the TV and Cindy used her Police iPhone app to run the DVD recording.

The ad showed Finneran and Silas from the Boards of Inquiry, together with Eldrick X. Weaver. Finneran was saying "The only protection blacks have against the Police brutality of Commander Donald Troy and Captain Teresa Croyle is the Board of Inquiry. But Commander Troy is re-writing the Charter to eliminate Boards of Inquiry, leaving blacks helpless in the face of Police racism and brutality. The Boards of Inquiry are the only thing keeping young black men from being <i>lynched</i> in this County." 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
Then Silas said "Vote NO on the Charter proposal on September 24th, and tell Commander Troy that covering up for Police brutality of minorities is not acceptable here." The boilerplate said that the ad was sponsored by the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union.

"Wow." I said. "They're going all out. And did you notice who paid for it? The NEA."

"I don't get it." said Teresa. "Todd said that his political sources said that Eldrick X. Weaver was for the Charter. Why did he appear in that ad, then?"

"But he didn't speak in it." said Tanya. "And that ad looked spliced together. I wonder if they misled him on it, and he walked off the set."

"That's Iron Crowbar thinking, there." I said. "Okay, let me go get Rodriguez and McGhillie...

<b>Part 6 - Cars and Crowbars</b>

10:30am, Monday, September 16th. We came into Midtown Police Headquarters. Chief Frank Soltis was already right there to greet us.

"Come on in, guys." he said after I introduced Rodriguez and McGhillie. "Let's go talk to the Team With No Nickname." He led the way into Headquarters, and up to their second floor. At the far end (the western end) he led us through a wooden door into an open space with windows for walls. There were six desks.

"Ah, corner office for this team." I said jovially. "Well deserved."

"Hi Commander!" said MPD Detective Nell Bell as she came up to me and gave me a hug. Eric Hannum, Kimberly Wesson, and Steve Ruger also came up to greet us, and I introduced Julia and Roy to anyone who didn't know them. (<i>Author's note: 'Environmental Hazards' for Wesson and Ruger, 'Shipping & Handling' for Bell and Hannum.</i>)

"These guys came down to talk about the car theft ring you may have chopped up, pun intended." I said. "I just came down to congratulate your new Detective Sergeant. Well, deserved, Kimberly!" I shook Detective Sergeant Kimberly Wesson's hand again.

"Thanks, Commander." Wesson said. "I didn't know you knew."

"Not much gets past this man." said Chief Soltis. "Commander, why don't you and I go talk in my office, and we'll leave our Joint Task Force to their work..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

As I sat down in what was Chief Soltis's hot chair in his office, with him behind his desk, he said "It was a tough choice between Wesson and Ruger, but Wesson has shown leadership promise. Steve Ruger took it in stride, and he may have his own team soon."

"Did you consider Nell Bell?" I asked.

"Sure did." Chief Soltis said. "The only knock against her is experience. And I was talking to Chief Moynahan about your Captain Perlman's idea of an Intelligence Division. I'd love to get out of being dependent upon the State SRIC, and Nell just might be my answer." I nodded.

Soltis continued: "I admit my other consideration was sentimental. Kimberly Wesson really reminds me of Molly Evans when she was our Detective Sergeant: sharp as a tack, tough as nails, and not afraid to be a leader. Ruger is solid, very solid. Hannum is doing well, but he needs time and experience to grow into the role he's being tasked to perform."

"Sounds like you're really getting this Police Force turned around for the good." I said. "You've done a great job with it."

"Thanks." said Soltis. "I freely admit that I didn't know if we'd get here, if I would get here. Then Chief Moynahan would tell me to just be as confident as the Iron Crowbar is, and I'd plow through." I chuckled at that.

"That confidence was all you." I said. "And you had a great mentor in Chief Moynahan. I learn a lot from him, too. So... any other cases going on down here?"

"Nothing out of the ordinary." said Soltis. "With the Legislature out of session, the sleaze and corruption tends to quieten down. Our biggest problem is that State Rep. Tasheeka Harris of Inner Midtown has been ratcheting up the 'Police brutality against minorities' crap. I noticed they're doing that in your County and in the City, as well, so it must be coordinated."

"Some of what they're accusing us of has to do with next week's Charter vote." I said. "I think it'll calm down some after the vote."

"As if you don't have enough to do, you have to go and re-write your County's Charter." said Soltis with a gleam in his eye. "What, are you going to re-write the State Constitution next?"

I grinned and said "If they asked me to, I probably would do it." I said. "Re-writing the Charter gave me a chance to have input in cleaning up the mess. Pass or fail, it was worth the time and effort to made a difference."

After a few more moments of Chief Soltis telling me what was going on in the MPD, he said "Okay, let's go talk to the team about these car thefts." We went back to their area. The only Detective there was Eric Hannum, sitting at his desk and running data.

"They all went to the China One Car Shop, Chief." said Hannum. "I'm here minding the store."

"Let's go see what's going on there." I suggested to Chief Soltis.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"I am telling you," Cochise said in his whispery voice as MPD Officers and Detectives were going through his place, "we do not deal in stolen cars here. We are not a chop shop."

"Gimme a break." said Nell Bell. "You lied on the stand about my previous visit here. And you're lying now, Cochise."

"Ah, but I did not lie." said Cochise. "You threatened me, saying the Iron Crowbar would come down here."

"It wasn't a threat."

That was whispered into Cochise's ear from behind him. He looked over his shoulder to see the broad-shouldered redhead with a Tilley Hat and a light trenchcoat looking down at him. I said "It was a... prediction, Cochise. And it has come true."

Cochise looked very shocked and very worried as I continued: "No, I did not like you lying on the stand, especially in the Blassingame case. I'd have been most very upset if Peter Blassingame wasn't on Death Row right now. You should've been thinking about your future, Cochise."

"I always do, Mr. Crowbar." said Cochise. "This is an honest business. As I told the pretty lady, this is not a chop shop."

"Wrong answer, Cochise." said Nell Bell. "The boys bring in the stolen Mercedes and Beamers from the Iron Crowbar's County, you strip out the tracking devices and change the VINs, then ship 'em out to Southport for transportation down the Big River."

"No idea what you are talking about, pretty lady." said Cochise, but now looking very worried.

"Your buddies in Turpin Heights pay you well for 'clean' cars." I said. "Unfortunately, you messed up on one of them. You didn't find the extra tracking devices we planted on some cars and left out like low-hanging fruit to be taken."

"And your boys bit: they took those cars." said Nell Bell. "We've tracked them through your shop here to Turpin Heights. Why, we even have the photos." She showed photos on her iPad of expensive cars without car tags coming into the shop, then leaving later.

"You see, Cochise," I said, "I'm here as an FBI Consultant. Since those cars crossed State lines, the Feds are about to come in here and tear you a new asshole, and they won't be leaving much of the China One Car Shop intact, either. And lying to a Federal Agent is a Federal crime, too. So... why don't you cooperate with Detective Bell here, make up for those sad, sad lies you told in Court... and maybe she'll generously provide you with a nice plea deal. Or... you can deal with me and the FBI. Your choice, Cochise. Your choice..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Wow, that was amazing!" Nell Bell said to me as we had lunch at a local buffet restaurant. "Cochise folded like a cheap deck chair when you came in. But... did you really have some of those cars bugged with trackers?"

I smiled. "If anyone asks, especially under oath, you and I can say that we the TCPD <i>did</i> put some trackers on some cars... my wife's Mercedes, Selena Steele's Corvette C-6, and a few others. But none of the cars we bugged were stolen."

I continued: "But when I told Cochise some of them were bugged, and then you had those photos your people took, he thought it was cause and effect, and that he'd sent cars with trackers to his buyers in Turpin Heights. You played along with that very nicely, too. And yes... he folded and began singing like a canary. And he'll be opening a new car shop somewhere far, far away from here, if he's smart."

Nell said "I sent Ted Crenshaw of the FBI in Southport the information we got from Cochise. Hopefully they can make a big bust. So... you weren't exactly telling the whole truth, were you?"

"Cochise lied, I lied." I said. "We are not obligated to tell the criminals the truth, but we have to do it carefully, and not in a way to be accused of entrapment. A clever mix of truth and fiction, combined with Cochise's conscience weighing on him for those lies in the trial, and he suddenly became all cooperative."

Nell said "And his fear of the Iron Crowbar helped. He looked like he was going to crap his pants when you came up behind him like that..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

As we reconvened in the office room of the MPD unit, Julie Rodriguez said "Chief, Commander, these guys need a name!" There was general acclaim.

"We better call Captain Perlman." I said. "She named me the Iron Crowbar."

"We can't call it 'Major Crimes'." said Chief Soltis. "We have separate Homicide, Robbery, and Sexual Crimes divisions."

"How about 'the Iron Crowbars of the Midtown PD'?" I suggested. Nell Bell shook her head vigorously in disagreement.

"Thank you, sir," Nell said, "but we are not there yet."

"Special Investigations." Julia Rodriguez said. "Either SIT or SIU, depending on if you call yourselves a Team or a Unit."

"That sounds good." said the MPD Chief.

"Is that what we should start calling you at home?" I asked Julia, teasing her.

"Once I get that secret cubicle built, sir." Julia replied, giving it right back. I chuckled and nodded.

<b>Part 7 - Fighting Back</b>

3:00pm, Monday, September 16th. We arrived back at Police Headquarters, and I instantly felt the buzz around the place. The Duty Desk Patrolman told me that the Chief wanted me to go to his office. I immediately did so, of course.

"How's Midtown?" asked Chief Moynahan as he had me sit down.

"Good, sir." I said. "Chief Soltis has really cleaned the MPD up, and the Special Investigations Unit, which is what Ruger, Wesson, Bell, and Hannum have decided to call themselves. is doing a great job."

"Yezzz, they are." said Moynahan. "Frank (Soltis) called and said he appreciated our help with the car theft ring. Seeeemmms you whispered sweet nothings into Cochise's ear, and he came back with some hard somp-thnnnnnnngs."

"An easily intimidated man, that Cochise." I said.

"Yezzz." said the Chief. "Anyway, as you are fond of saying: 'let's watch some TV'." He turned on his monitor and we watched as a recorded ad was played. It showed me and Roy Easley, in civilian clothes but with our Medals of Valor around our necks, extolling the virtues of the new Charter. The boilerplate said the ad was paid for by the J.P. Goldman Campaign PAC.

"Looks good." I said.

"Yezzz." said the Chief. "But there have already been complaints made and a lawsuit filed, saying you're making a political ad in uniform by wearing your MOV."

"That's a crock, sir." I said. "And by the way, did the people filing the lawsuit also file one against Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker?"

"Noooo, of course not." said Chief Moynahan. "I'm just letting you know."

"Wait until they see the next one." I said. "I'm filming it later today."

"Heh heh heh heh." said the Chief.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Tuesday, September 17th, from her perch atop the building at Riverside and College. "More legal complaints against Commander Donald Troy have been filed!"

Bettina began: "Several groups have filed complaints against Commander Donald Troy for an ad showing him in uniform promoting the new Charter. The groups are rightly complaining that Commander Troy is breaking the law by appearing in the ads in uniform. They also filed complaints against Fire Lieutenant Roy Easley for appearing in the same ad in uniform. A lawsuit by the NEA regarding those ads was thrown out by Judge Patrick Folsom. Reached for comment, Fire Chief Quinlin stated that the accusations would be reviewed, and that Lt. Easley would be disciplined if the situation warranted. Police Chief Moynahan issued a statement defending Commander Troy. Commander Troy has not responded to repeated requests for comment by KXTC."

Bettina: "As part of this, KXTC Executive Publisher Burt West issued a statement saying KXTC will not air these ads nor any pro-Charter ads until the FEC and local authorities make a ruling on their legality. KXTC <i>will</i> continue to run legal ads by the NEA and other anti-Charter organizations!"

Bettina: "And the NEA intends to file a complaint with the Town & County Council at the public meeting tonight, saying that the Town & County Police, and Commander Don Troy in particular, used excessive force in arresting six persons who <i>allegedly</i> assaulted a Fire Department employee and his fiancée..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Getting to be like a broken record." growled Sheriff Griswold as we watched and drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room.

"And the double standard still reigns supreme." I said. 

"You weren't in uniform!" exclaimed Teresa Croyle.

I replied "They're saying that wearing the MOV with civilian clothes, which is allowed, constitutes being in uniform. It's not, it never has been, but the NEA is clutching at every straw they can."

"We all wore our MOVs with civilian clothes when the Sheriff announced he was running for Sheriff." said Cindy Ross. "No one said a word then."

"And we'll be bringing that up when we file our counter to their complaint." I said. "I'm not really worried about all that, though."

"So KXTC is not running <i>any</i> pro-Charter ads?" Cindy said skeptically.

"They weren't anyway." I replied. "They refused to take any pro-Charter ads that had stipulations on the times the ads had to be run. The ones they took, they ran at 3:00am. That drew a complaint with the FCC and FEC, so now KXTC is just saying they won't take pro-Charter ads at all."

"Lawyers are really getting rich off all this." growled the Sheriff.

"Yes sir," I said, "and that's part of the NEA's strategy. They have millions they can pour into this, and they think we don't have the resources to respond."

"And they're right. We don't." said Cindy.

"We have other ways to fight back." I said. "Six of their thugs are in jail, and they're wasting thousands of dollars paying lawyers to defend those guys."

"And they're going to be <i>en fuego</i> when they see your next ad." said Tanya, with a twinkle in her eye and a wicked grin on her lovely face.

"Yes. Yes they are." I said with my own smile of happy anticipation... 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"... and in local news," said Meredith Peller on the Fox Eight News broadcast, "the NEA filed a complaint against Police Commander Donald Troy and Fire Lieutenant Roy Easley for appearing in a pro-Charter ad in uniform. Both Medal of Valor recipients wore their medals with civilian clothing, which is permitted under County law, but the NEA stated in their complaint that that constitutes being in uniform. A counter-complaint was lodged, citing precedent rulings that MOVs with civilian clothing is not considered uniform wear."

Catrina Pierce said "Considering that the NEA actually sponsored an ad which shows Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker in uniform, isn't that more than a little bit hypocritical of the NEA?"

"The Teachers Union expects us to not see that, nor say it on air." said Meredith with great acerbity. "I agree it's hypocrisy."

"Another thing that is hypocritical of the NEA," said Catrina, "is their announcement that they're going to ask the Council to investigate Commander Donald Troy for excessive use of force in arresting six thugs with NEA ties that are charged with attempted rape and other crimes of violence."

Meredith said "I don't have a problem with investigating the Police for possible excessive use of force, and the truth will come out. But I agree that the NEA's hypocrisy and double standard in their actions is insulting to our intelligence."

Catrina said "It shows me a certain desperation in the NEA's actions to defeat the new Charter from being passed. And speaking of that, let's bring in Peter Dwayne Gordon with Clear Call Polling. Peter, what are the numbers telling us?"

"Thank you for having me on, Catrina and Meredith." said Peter. "The numbers are showing that the 'YES' votes are in the lead by a 52-48% margin overall. The areas of the County that are part of the County High School school system show the strongest numbers against the Charter, with nearly 80% opposed. But this is offset by the numbers in the Booker T. Washington High School districts, which show a 60% preference for the new Charter."

"Peter," said Meredith, "there is a growing movement of people who are in favor of splitting the Town and County back into two separate entities. How is that looking?"

"We did ask that as a poll question." said Peter Gordon. "The numbers are all over the map, pun not intended. Despite the consensus opinion, it's really the business district areas and some of the minority districts that support the split the most, while much of the outlying areas support the <i>status quo.</i>..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Why is that?" asked Cindy Ross as we sat in my office to start the Angels Meeting.

"I'm sure Teresa remembers hearing about J.G. McGill." I said. (<i>Author's note: 'The Saga Continues', Ch. 04.</i>) "It was said that the County people finally approved of the merger because it diluted black voting power, and kept the Town Council from having majority black membership. So I can see a good bit of the outlying County continuing to want the merged entities, while those in Town might want to split up again. But why does the Business Community want to split? I'm not there yet on that."

Teresa said "I do remember that, sir. I'm just wondering why it's suddenly being pushed at this time."

"It's a time of uncertainty, with the potential new Charter." I said. "Oh, here's my new ad."

Everyone watched as I came onto the screen in a civilian suit and tie. Next to me, to my Angels's stunned amazement, was Eldrick X. Weaver. Weaver said "I'm Eldrick X. Weaver, and this is Charter Commission Chairman Donald Troy. Chairman Troy and I don't agree on everything, but one thing we do agree on is that this new Charter and the new School Board in it will give <i><u>all</u></i> the County's children the best education we can give them."

Then I said "Therefore, we ask you to vote 'YES' on the Charter on September 24th." The boilerplate said that the ad was paid for by the Citizens for Children's Education.

"Wowwwwwww..." Cindy said. "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, indeed."

"Yep." I said. "Weaver was furious at being tricked into being in that ad with Finneran and Silas. So he agreed to make this ad with me. And we had a few minutes of good conversation, as well. I dunno if it'll help in the long run, but one never knows."

"I think your name was 'Machiavelli' in a previous life." said Tanya. "That is really going to stir up a hornet's nest."

I just grinned. No, Your Iron Crowbar don't play...

<b>Part 8 - Political Power Struggle</b>

7:00pm, Tuesday, September 17th. I was at City Hall with Teresa, both of us in our standard uniforms of light blue shirts with soft shoulderboards, dark blue pants, me with a double thin line of light blue piping on my pants, Teresa with one thick line along the sides of hers. 
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
A large contingent of 2nd shift Police Officers and Sheriff Deputies were in the hallway, some of them armored. We hadn't said much about it, but Teresa wanted to test deployment of our better trained 2nd shift personnel, and they were the ones in the armor and ready for potential hostile action.

We watched as people came in. No one in a red Antifa shirt came in, and very few Blacks. The majority of the people were white, and I recognized a number of them as being from the the wealthiest suburbs north of Town. Some of them, and many of the rest that showed up, were teachers in the County High system districts. There were also a number of men and women in NEA shirts. When they'd first arrived, they had a purposeful look on their faces. But after seeing the very large contingent of Town & County Law Enforcement, they looked a lot less certain.

"No firefighters today." said Teresa as the 7:30 time to begin the session neared. "Word I got is that a lot of them were upset by the attack on AFC Davies."

"Let's give Roy Easley some credit, too." I said. "He's very respected by the TCFD, like you are by the TCPD. His support of the Charter may have turned some in the Fire Department to our side."

The audience chamber was only half full as the Council Members filed in and took their seats. As they settled in, Mayor Allgood gaveled the session into order.

"First, an announcement." said the Mayor. "We will not be meeting next Tuesday night, September 24th, due to the Charter plebiscite on that day. We will be meeting the next evening, September 25th, primarily to conduct business related to the aftermath of the result of that plebiscite, and we likely will not be taking public statements at that meeting. Okay, let's begin."

Among the lawsuits filed was one against the Police on behalf of the six arrested suspects, for Police excessive use of force. The Mayor singled it out, saying to pass it to the City Attorney with an emphasis on fighting it.

When it came time for the People to (verbally) petition the Government for the redress of wrongs, the first to stand up was the NEA spokesman, attired in a different $5000 suit than the others he'd worn before. "I am here to call upon the Town & County Council to join the NEA in condemning the proposed new Charter, and to ask the Council for a public resolution calling upon the voters of the Town & County to vote against it."

"I so move." said Kelly Carnes. "I move to join the NEA in condemning the new Charter proposal, and for a public resolution urging our constituents to vote against it."

"I second." said Malinda Adams.

"Without objection?" said the Mayor. There were six objections.

"Not only am I strongly opposed to this motion," said J.P. Goldman strongly, "I wish to be on record as opposing the NEA's positions on this matter. Therefore, I request and require a recorded vote."

"And you shall have it." said Mayor Allgood. "Discussion? Debate?" There being none, the Mayor said "Let's vote." The vote was 2-8, with only Carnes and Adams voting for it, and Reginald B.F. Lewis among those voting against.

"The motion fails." said Mayor Allgood. "Next speaker, please?"

The next speaker was the NEA-hired attorney for the six arrested perps. After introducing himself, he said: "The Police brutality exercised in the apprehension of my clients must be investigated. I call upon you to authorize and require a Board of Inquiry to investigate Commander Donald Troy and the TCPD, and I request that that Board of Inquiry be led by Commissioner Finneran."

"Anyone want to make a motion?" asked the Mayor.

"I move we go into Executive Session to debate this." said Reginald B.F. Lewis.

"I second." said Malinda Adams.

"This will require a recorded vote." said the Mayor. "Debate?" There was none. "Let's vote." said the Mayor. The vote was 5-5, and the Mayor voted to defeat the motion.

"I move to require a Board of Inquiry concerning the arrests," said Kelly Carnes immediately, "and that Commissioner Finneran be the lead examiner."

"I second!" shouted Reginald B.F. Lewis happily.

"I have a Point of Order." said Mayor Allgood. "The naming of the persons on the Board are the pervue of the Mayor, and I'm not giving that up. So the attempt to name Finneran to it is a violation of the current County Charter."

"I disagree." said Kelly Carnes. "If we state it in the ordinance I've just introduced, then that supersedes the Mayor's general privilege to name Commission members."

"I agree with the Mayor, and completely disagree with Carnes." said J.P. Goldman, his voice seemingly angry. "The Charter is clear on that. The ordinance would be illegal, and there won't be a BOI for years while my lawsuit works its way through the Courts."

There was lively input from all the Council Members. Susan Weston and Sheila Sorrells said they were incensed that going into Executive Session was voted down, and that they'd be voting for the BOI in retaliatory response. Edward Steele and John Colby voiced their agreements that the Mayor's right to name the Board members was being unlawfully usurped.

Finally, the Mayor got it to a vote. To no one's stunned amazement, it was 5-5. "The Council being evenly divided, the Mayor votes 'nay', and the motion is defeated."

That got a number of people in the audience to start screaming and yelling. And that got a number of Police Officers and Deputy Sheriff's to file into the chamber, heavily armored and ready to make arrests. The demonstrations quickly quieted down...

<b>Part 9 - Intelligence</b>

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Friday, September 20th, from the roof of the building on Riverside and College, with City Hall in the background. "The Charter Commission appears to be destined to be totally humiliated as the new Charter they proposed heads for a crushing in defeat at the polls next Tuesday!"

Bettina began: "As we head into the final weekend before the Charter vote next Tuesday, September 24th, it increasingly looks like unpopular new Charter will be defeated. We have with us Karl Frazier of Public Policy Polling. Karl, what can you tell us about next Tuesday's vote?"

A split-screen with Karl Frazier appeared. He said "Bettina, passage of the new Charter will depend on the turnout. The higher the turnout, the more likely the measure will be defeated. Minorities in the southern parts of the County are very unhappy with destroying the Boards of Inquiry, and the wealthy white homeowners in the northern part of the County are disgusted with the distribution of school tax revenues. Chairman Donald Troy has to hope that turnout is very low, but the voters appear energized to defeat his Charter proposal at the ballot box."

"Thank you, Karl!" said Bettina happily as the screen came back to just her. "And in a related story, despite rules against political actions or attending political events in uniform, Sheriff Antonio Griswold has not taken any action against Fire Chief Quinlin or Battalion Chief Tucker for appearing in 'Vote-NO' ads while in uniform. In a statement, Sheriff Griswold said he would take action after the Charter vote, so that his actions would not unduly influence the vote."

Bettina: "And Channel Two News has learned that there could be several announcements for candidacies for a number of offices, some of them being newly created offices, and some announcements for existing offices. Additionally, there may be changes to the Police Department as well as the District Attorney's Office, which will not be announced until after the Charter vote..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Out of curiosity," said Tanya Perlman as we watched the broadcast and drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room, "what exactly will the School Board be doing, if they can't spend the tax revenues?"

"Oh, they can spend the money." I said. "They just can't set the tax rates, and the expenditures have to be on a per-student basis. What they will do is re-draw the school district lines if the Charter passes, then re-draw them after every Census; they'll set teacher pay rates, which again have to be uniform throughout the County, with some provisions for science and math teachers getting bonuses in accordance with State policies; and they'll have input on the curriculum and the schoolbooks, again above and beyond what the State requires."

Teresa asked: "Can the County High district get around that per-student requirement with Charter Schools, things like that?"

"I hope not." I said. "We tried hard to write it to allow Charter Schools, Vocational Schools, and such things, but they have to be uniform in expenditure <u>or</u> available to everyone equally. For example, Town High has the best Vocational School in the State. County High and BTS High don't have vocational programs, or very poor attempts at them, and what's going to happen is that students from all over the County can apply to enter the Vocational program at Town High. The School Board will be in charge of that, and you better believe it'd better be fair and equitable, or you'll be hearing about it."

"So there might be loopholes." said Teresa.

"Well," I said, "we tried to make it foolproof, but the problem is that Fools are so damn ingenious." Everyone laughed, then I finished: "I'm sure they'll find a way, and the Council and Town Assembly will have to plug the leaks."

"I no-tissssed," said Chief Moynahan, "that that Karl Frazier fellow did not give any actual poll num-berrrrrrs."

"No surprise there." growled Sheriff Griswold. "My people's polling has it right at 50-50."

"Is that good or bad, Sheriff?" asked Cindy Ross.

"Crowbar?" said the Sheriff, redirecting the question to me.

"Well," I said, "it's good in that it's not as bad as Bettina and the Media make it sound. But I'd like to have a lead of several points going in. And I'm not getting a good feel for the mood of the Electorate."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Okay whaddya got?" I asked Teresa and Tanya as they sat in front of my desk for the Angels meeting.

"Trespassers at Point Hollow, sir." said Teresa. "We didn't have anyone stationed up there Tuesday night, because I had the manpower at the Council meeting. Wednesday night we got a call from the weather station on the top of the cliff above Point Hollow. They were hearing chants in the Hollow. We sent a patrol up there, but no one was found to be on the property. That patrol stayed up there at the gate the rest of the night." The gate was on the road leading to Point Hollow.

Teresa: "The next morning, Coleman and Newman from Vice went up and looked around. They found footprints in the copse of trees, and the remains of a small fire."

"Any drugs? Paraphernalia?" I asked.

"No sir." said Teresa. "Also, last night we had a third shift patrol come in fifteen minutes early and go up there, so they were there right at midnight. They caught six people. Five of the six people were all between 18-22 years old, but none of them are enrolled at the University, nor ever were. And the 1960s called and asked for their 'hippie' clothing and face paint back."

Tanya said "Roy McGhillie ran checks on them this morning. The one guy that was older than 22, is 28 years old. He's a University graduate that majored in Spiritual Psychology, and claims to be the Reverend of a church. His name is Bob Stevens." I looked up Bob Stevens, and saw a DMV photo of a man with long brown hair and mustache, looking like a cross between Charles Manson and Jesus Christ (no puns nor blasphemy intended).

"Yep, very stereotypical cult guru type." I said. "Does the Reverend Stevens have a criminal record?"

"No sir." said Tanya. "But he's been served lawsuit subpoenas and warrants a total of fifteen times in the last six years. So-called 'parishioners' who claimed he fleeced them. None of those in our County, though."

"What happened to them?" I asked. "Last night, I mean."

"They were run through booking," Teresa said, "but since none of them had any priors, and had not been caught trespassing at Point Hollow before, they were issued warning citations and released."

"Sir," Tanya said, "I might add that since your battle with the Slender Man there, we get trespassers wanting to see the place. Most of them are from England, some are Dr. Mickelson's students. We just issue them warnings and let them go, as long as it's a first-time offense and they have no outstanding warrants."

"I'm glad you put last night's crew through booking." I said. "Put out word to the Force that anyone trespassing at Point Hollow is to go through booking, and then they can be released if nothing else on them comes up. I do like having that data on them in our evidence servers. And repeat offenders need to be held, so that I can have a philosophical exchange of ideas with them---"

<i>*KNOCK!* *KNOCK!* *KNOCK!* *KNOCK!*</i>

The door opened to reveal Chief Moynahan. "I'm sorry to interrupt your meeet-inngg," he said, "but I need you all in the Main Conference Room. Captain Perlman, have your laptop with your presentation ready..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

My Angels meeting was usurped. We followed the Chief into the Main Conference Room for the meeting. Present were: the Sheriff, the Chief, me, my three Angels, and Lieutenants Mary Milton and Jerome Davis. I swept for bugs, finding none.

"O-kayyyyy," drawled the Chief. "The Sheriff has asked me to put together any new structural changes, so that we can submit them at the next Council meeting on Wednesday night. We are thinking in terms of this new Intelligence Divisionnnnnn. Start us off, Captain Perrrrlmannnnn..."

"Yes sir, thank you sir." said Tanya. She connected her laptop to the projector on the wall at the far end of the table, and began her presentation. "First of all, the new Intelligence Division is <i>not</i> an I.T. branch. It's not about running the physical computers or servers, or writing the code used to make our searches and store information."

Tanya: "A lot of what I'm about to describe, we already do... but in a loose, disjointed way. Lainie and Sonali look up data for our Detectives, but the Detectives do a lot of it themselves. The Detectives often have to do the paperwork to get warrants, as well. And they're not always talking to each other, especially MCD and Vice Detectives not really talking to each other. And the CSI's need a more well-defined box on the org chart."

Tanya: "Another aspect is planning ahead. Captain Croyle and Commander Troy do a lot of this, such as putting together plans for riot control and anti-terrorist actions. But the Intelligence unit could do a lot of that, based on information they receive and collect. They can also be the central clearinghouse for C.I.s." 

Tanya: "So, what I propose is an Intelligence Division to go alongside MCD and Vice. Intelligence will have data miners and analysts, and they'll have the CSIs, and they can assist the MCD and Vice Detectives in data collection, analysis, and dissemination. They can also be responsible for applying for warrants on behalf of the Detectives."

"I like giving the CSI's a home and a chain-of-command." I said. "Prevents me from having to beat up the Deputy Chief to have control of them." A green crowbar was waved in my direction. I continued: "I also like the analysis unit, which includes the planning ahead portions."

"My problem," I said, "is understanding just what the Intelligence Division Officers are going to do. Do they sit at computer screens all day? Can they go into the field? Tanya, take me through it from the crime scene to the trial."

Tanya said "The Crime Lab deploys to the scene of a crime, and usually at least two Detectives do, also. The lead Detective is in charge, especially when he has oak leaves... and soon to be a star... on his shoulders. They process the scene. At that point, the data starts coming in. They can also ask for data to be looked up, such as a person's name, while they're in the field processing the scene. They can ask for warrants while they're in the field, and astute Intel Officers can be getting the warrants even before the Detectives are asked."

"Noooo, I don't want that." I said. "The decision to call and get a warrant is a top-down process."

"Yes sir." said Tanya. "Anyway, normally the Detectives go and do interviews and stuff." said Tanya. "If we need the manpower, some of the senior Intelligence Officers can also do that, or can go with or back up the Detectives."

"Chief, Commander, if I may." said Lt. Mary Milton. We nodded and she said "One long term advantage to this is that it creates a flow towards MCD and Vice. New Officers and Detectives work in Intel, get seasoning, gradually get field assignments, and then work up to Vice and to MCD."

Teresa said "That's how the Uniformed Officers do it. Routine patrols, getting training to go out on missions and busts, and as they gain experience, they get leadership opportunities."

"Those are good points." said Sheriff Griswold.

Cindy Ross said "Okay, that covers MCD. What about the Vice side of it. Vice already develops leads and intel, then they plan and make the busts."

"That's true." said Tanya. "They'll still have plenty of fieldwork to do: stakeouts, surveillance, stings. And having the additional resources of an Intel unit helping to develop and analyze data will just make things faster and more efficient."

"But redundant." said Chief Moynahan.

"Maybe not, Chief." Jerome Davis said. "We get a murder or robbery in MCD. We send in the data, and the Intel people run it. A name related to a drug operation that Vice is working on comes up, and we're working together instead of inadvertently stepping on each other's toes."

"That should happen anyway." said the Chief, a bit sourly.

"Yes, Chief, it should." I said. "But it doesn't always do so perfectly, or it happens over a longer time frame than it should."

"O-kayyyy." said the Chief. "So tell me about the rank structure."

"As with Vice and MCD," Tanya said, "it'll be headed by a Lieutenant. I'll be looking for a Detective Sergeant to lead the Crime Lab division, and a Detective Sergeant or higher for the Analysis branch. I've had talks with Lt. Mary Milton about moving to the Intelligence Lieutenant slot. I'm thinking in terms of moving Senior Detective Purvis over, as well, as he's my guru for financial crimes right now, and he's good at numbers and stuff."

"Lainie and Sonali will continue to be civilian techs." Tanya continued. "Detective-1s and civilians would be the junior Officers in there, and someone would be assigned to making the actual, paperwork warrant requests, though anyone could do it."

"Would any Uniformed Officers be a part of this?" asked the Chief.

"No sir." said Tanya. "Of course Officers are trained on evidence collection, and their reports on anything they do would feed into our data system for analysis."

"Speaking of that," said Cindy Ross, "how much is setting up a new Intelligence Center going to cost this Police Department?"

Tanya said "We already have the foundational structure, thanks to Lt. Myron Milton and his I.T. Department. Setup and new equipment would be a one-time cost, but after that, it shouldn't be much more than our current budget."

"Commander Ross," said Chief Moynahan, "You and I will discuss costs at a later time, so let's not worry about that at the moment. Okay, are there more questions? If not, I need to meet with my Commanders, and if you'd like to join us, Sheriff, you're most welcome to do soooo. Captain Perlman, you have all weekend to get this into shape. We meet with the Council on Wednesday..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The four of us met in the Chief's Conference Room, sitting where we normally do for coffee klatches: the Chief at the near end, me to his left, Cindy to his right, and the Sheriff to my left.

--------------------------------------------
"First of all, Commander Ross," the Chief said, "the money is taken care of. You may rememberrrr those generous donations by the mysterious 'R.C. Christian', which included money for a new dog for our K-9 Corps. What was not announced was that another ten million dollars was donated to the TPCD, provided that the money be used exclusively for upgrading our equipment and servers in I.T. as well as the implementation of an Intelligence Center."

"Oh, wowwww..." Cindy said. She looked at me.

"That's awesome." I said. "Any idea who this 'R.C. Christian' is?"

"Hell, Crowbar," said Sheriff Griswold, "if you haven't figured it out and can't tell us, why do you think we'd know?"

"Heh." said the Chief. "And I haven't heard of any granite Guidestones being built at Point Hollow or anywhere else, so maybe this 'R.C. Christian' is just a copycat of the one that built the Georgia Guidestones."

"I say we don't look the gift horse in the mouth." I said. Cindy nodded vigorously in agreement.

"Well, what do you guys think of an Intelligence branch?" the Chief asked us.

I nodded for Cindy to go first. She said: "I like the concept of it. What I'm wondering about is the interaction between MCD, Vice, and this new Intel Division. If not done right, there's a lot of overlap, and I can sense the possibility of confusion."

"And you, Mr. Crowbar?" asked the Chief.

"I like some of it a lot." I said. "And some of it is growing on me. I also share your earlier sentiment about redundancy, and I agree with Commander Ross about the potential for confusion."

"But do you think it's worth it to doooo." asked (suggested) the Chief.

"It's paid for, sir." I said. "So I'll abide by whatever you and the Sheriff decide."

"It's decided." said the Sheriff. "We're going to do it, especially since we have that anonymous gift money."

"And it's up to yooooo and Captain Perlman to iron out the wrinkles and make it work, Mr. Crowbarrr." said the Chief. "And as I told Mizzz Perlmannnn... you have <i>all</i> weekend long to work it up into a presentation for the Coun-culllllll..."

<b>Part 10 - Day of Reckoning</b>

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Tuesday, September 24th, from Courthouse Square in front of City Hall. "Today is the vote on the new Town & County Charter!"

Bettina began: "The polls are opening just now, and the lines to vote are heavy in the majority-black districts as well as the northern County suburbs, two areas that we expect to be deeply opposed to Commander Donald Troy and his Commission's Charter proposal. We have with us Karl Frazier of Public Policy Polling. Karl, is all this just a colossal waste of the taxpayers's money?"

Karl Frazier was standing next to Bettina as he said "No, Bettina, at least it will tell us what is important to the County's voters."

Bettina said "So if and when a new Commission attempts to re-write the Charter again, hopefully without Donald Troy on the Commission, they'll have a better idea of what the Voters really want?"

Frazier: "That's right, Bettina. But if this Charter proposal is defeated, I seriously doubt there will simply be another attempt to re-write it. We'll either be stuck with exactly what we have now, or it's possible the Town & County will be split into separate entities again."

Bettina: "If this Charter fails, <i>and it increasingly looks like it will</i>, what is the likelihood of a Town & County split happening? What do your numbers tell you on that?"

Frazier: "Right now, it's only about 20% in favor of a split. However, we're doing exit polling, and we're asking what people prefer if this Charter doesn't pass. And we're expecting those numbers to go up substantially."

"Thank you, Karl!" said Bettina. As the camera zoomed in on her again, she said "And District Attorney Miriam Walters has announced a Press Conference for Thursday morning. While she did not give details on what it would be about, Channel Two News has learned that she could announce structural changes to the District Attorney's Office that will bring our DA Office more into line with other DA Offices in the State.

Bettina: "And Sheriff Griswold has announced a Press Conference for tomorrow morning, and Channel Two News has learned that the Sheriff will announced his planned actions regarding Fire Chief Quinlin's breach of Public Safety Department rules by appearing in anti-Charter ads in uniform..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Nice suit, Commander." Tanya Perlman said, every so slightly flirtatiously. I was wearing my recently dry-cleaned dark gray suit, white shirt, Wildcat Red tie, badge on belt, and gun in shoulder holster under my left armpit.

"Yeah," I said, "I might have to appear on TV today to exhort the masses to go to the polls, or talk about the Charter on air. So this is easier than having to change clothes."

Teresa Croyle asked "Is Karl Frazier right?" To everyone's suprise, I began laughing.

"That was hilarious, what he just did to Bettina." I said. "And it went right over her head."

"It must've gone over my head, toooooo." said the Chief. "Enlighten me."

"If you re-watch that exchange, but realizing that Karl Frazier <i>wants</i> the Charter to succeed, you'll see what he did." I said. "He just told people, and right into Bettina's microphone, that if people don't vote for the Charter, they'll be stuck with what we have now or the Town & County might split apart again."

"And my campaign people's data," growled Sheriff Griswold, "shows that people do want change, and they don't really want to split apart."

"Oh, I see what you mean." said Cindy Ross. "Yes, very subtle, very subliminal. Anyway, and changing the subject... so Miriam Walters is going to go through with it? She's going to demote Paulina?"

"We don't knowwwww." drawled the Chief.

"She was going to have the Press Conference tomorrow," said Sheriff Griswold, "until she found out that I was having mine. So she delayed it a day."

"And she wants to meet with me to-morrowwww." said the Chief. "I won't be surprised if she wants to talk with you tooooo, Mr. Crowbarrrr..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"... and the lines at the polling sites are very long!" said Priya Ajmani as her cameraman showed the very long line of people waiting to vote at Joe Smedley Elementary School. "Our exit polling is showing a close race. People are very interested in the race, and they understand the key issues."

Catrina Pierce said from the Fox Eight studios: "Priya, have there been any disruptions at the polls? Are NEA-supported protesters making any trouble for voters?"

"No, Catrina!" said Priya. "There are Police and Sheriff Department Officers dispersed to all the polling sites, and everyone knows what Commander Donald Troy did to those Black Panthers last November!..." (<i>Author's note: 'The Four Boxes of Liberty', Ch. 05.</i>) 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"All right, what's going on besides this plebiscite?" I asked my Angels.

Teresa said "More arrests at Point Hollow, one of them a repeat. Guru Bob Stevens. Four others with him, this time. All college-aged, two of them University students. We took them through booking, then released the others. Stevens is in a holding cell here, but we may release him rather than put him on the paddywagon to take to Court for the arraignment."

"I better go talk to him, then." I said. 

"Sir," said Teresa, "is there really a degree called 'Spiritual Psychology?"

"Yes!" I said. "Yes there is. I checked with my Top Confidential informant in the Psychology Department..." My Angels giggled, knowing I was referring to my wife Laura, "... and it's not an actual major, but a specialization within the Psychology Department. The vast majority of students who study it end up working for the FBI or other Law Enforcement as criminal or operational psychologists."

"Ohhhhh..." said Cindy, getting it. "He may be undercover in some way."

"Yep." I said. "If so, I don't want to blow that, so I'm going to speak with him, and hopefully get a vibe..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Guru Bob Stevens was in a tie-dye shirt that looked more like a woman's blouse, old and ragged blue jeans, and old loafers when I came into Interrogation-1, pretending to read a file. With me was Detective Julia Rodriguez.

"Namaste, Detective." said Stevens, his hands together as in prayer as he gave a slight bow, thinking that because I was in a civilian suit, he mistook me for a Detective.

"It's 'Commander'." said Julia, her voice 'not friendly', as I sat down opposite Stevens.

"The Iron Crowbar?" the suspect said, his eyes wide with surprise. "I thought you always wore your uniform." I looked up and peered at him; he seemingly had just fucked up and revealed something.

"Whatever I wear," I said, "it's not a half century old like your clothes. So why do my Officers keep finding you at Point Hollow, Guru Stevens?"

"Because the day is coming!" said Stevens, making his eyes wide in seeming deranged passion. "The day of the Demon's release! We come to Abaddon, to witness the release of the Abatu!"

I peered intently at the man, feeling the negative energy coming from him. "Okay," I said, "So enlighten me as to what's going on with that, that keeps you coming back and trespassing, breaking the law."

"To be witness to the release." said Stevens, a bit more calmly and rationally. "Join me, Iron Crowbar. You've seen the power of Abaddon; you battled his agent there, and survived." He must be referring to my engaging the Slender Man in personal combat, I realized. Another thing he appeared to know about me, I noted to myself.

"All right." I said, getting up. "Keep trespassing up there, and you'll end up with a criminal charge serious enough to keep you in jail. I would imagine the judge is going to enjoin you from being seen at Point Hollow again, and I would suggest you heed his instructions." With that I left the room, Julia in tow.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"That guy's a nutjob." I said to Julia as we walked down the hallway towards MCD. "Listen, I want you to dig into that guy's past, and I want you to watch the duty logs to see if his name pops up again. Something is not right about him, and by that I mean what he's pretending to be."

"Yes sir." said Julia. "Any suggestions on what to look for in his past?"

"His cult ties." I said. "I understand he's had lawsuits against him. See what those are about..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

When I got to the anteroom of my office, my assistant Helena pointed at Cindy's open office door, which was to the right of mine. I peered inside, and saw Cindy at her desk, with Our Sheriff sitting in a chair on the other side. I gave Helena a thumbs-up, then knocked on Cindy's door.

"Come on in, Don." Cindy said. "And close the door behind you." I did so, then sat down the lumbar-support chair she had brought in especially for me and my bad back.

"What's up?" I asked.

"First, what's going on with that cult guy and Point Hollow?" growled the Sheriff. I told him about my brief conversation with the Guru. The Sheriff said "So he's a nutjob?"

"I'm going to check up on a couple of things about him." I said. "There may be more to him than we're seeing on the surface."

"You're the one with the x-ray vision, Don." Cindy said.

"Har." said the Sheriff. "Crowbar, I was just talking to Cindy about what's going to be happening in the D.A.'s Office. Miriam Walters wants to talk to you, both of you and the Chief, about it tomorrow. What I want, and need, is for you to be nice and not get upset at her."

"Is she demoting Paulina?" I asked in reply.

"If she does," said the Sheriff, "it's her business, and Paulina's. Not ours."

"With respect, Sheriff," I said, "it's ours, too. We have to work with the D.A.'s Office to ensure successful prosecutions of our arrests; otherwise, our work is for nothing. And if Walters is going to demote the best ADA she has to make room for a less qualified ADA who is her crony... that's a problem for us. And I haven't even gotten to the racial optics of it."

"I know." said the Sheriff. "I also know it's her Department. I caught a lot of hell making you my Police Commander, back in the day. Imagine, promoting a young whippersnapper like you over longtime veteran Officers!"

"Sir," said Cindy, "it's not the same thing. That was a <i>pro</i>-motion, not a <i>de</i>-motion. And there were no racial overtones about it, unless someone was upset with a redhead being promoted to Police Commander."

"And speaking of that," said Griswold, "I heard a lot of flak about Commander Troy promoting his own cousin to Captain, then her being promoted to Deputy Commander, never mind that you worked your ass off to be qualified and ready for the XO job. But I get the point that those were promotions. I'm mentioning them as the appearance of cronyism. Sometimes it can't be avoided."

"Still, Sheriff," I said, "as Cindy said, those weren't demotions. When was the last time we demoted anyone that wasn't for cause? If Walters humiliates Paulina by demoting her, and note that she'd be demoted alongside Dwayne Gregory, that would be inexcusable. And I still wonder if it's not racially motivated."

"All I'm asking," growled the Sheriff, and I could tell he was beginning to get irritated with us, "is that you listen to the D.A., let her tell her side of it, and then find a way to calmly and reasonably change her mind. Don't make a fight of it; you'll just get her hackles up, and that would be a shame because she's on the same side as us. She's not Krasney."

I just nodded. Cindy said "Okay, sir."

"I've got to get back to City Hall." said the Sheriff. "They are already accusing me of spending too much time here."

"Yes sir." I said. "Reginald B.F. Lewis noticed, and he wants you to be dispersed to the Precincts." Cindy burst out laughing, and the Sheriff's mustaches twitched merrily. he made his goodbyes and left.

"He <i><u>is</u></i> right, you know." said Cindy. "We don't need a fight with the D.A.'s Office. We have to work with them, no matter what Miriam Walters does."

"I know." I said.

"And it's personal." said Cindy. "I get it, Paulina is the mother of your daughter, and there's no one who takes up for his family more than you. But----"

"Hold on." I said. "Yes, it's personal. But even if it wasn't, what Walters is doing is demoting a better prosecutor for a lesser one, and for cronyism reasons. And that hurts us professionally. And the collateral damage, the fallout, is that one of our Detective's brother, who is also a damn good ADA, is going to take it as a racial thing. And if it gets ugly within the D.A.'s Office, that's going to spill out onto us."

I got up to go back to my office. "Okay, I'll try to figure it out tonight while we're waiting for Charter results. So last chance... the Charter: pass or fail?"

Cindy got out an envelope from here desk, wrote something on a piece of paper, and sealed it in the envelope. "Don't open it until the results are in." I nodded and took the sealed envelope, and went back to my office.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I called FBI Supervisory Agent Melina Allgood on my Police iPhone. After greetings, I said "Is this line secure?"

"Is it a cellphone?" Melina asked back. "I'll come over to your office."

A few moments later, my lovely ex-wife was sitting in my office. I handed her a copy of the TCPD's file on Guru Bob Stevens. "What I need to know," I said, "is if he's undercover for anyone in any branch of any Government, be it Fed, State, or Local. I don't want to blow his cover if he is. And if he isn't, he may be a latent threat."

"I can check him out." said Melina. "And in ways no one will know about. What makes you think that he is?"

I replied: "For one thing, he knew a lot about me, though he didn't immediately recognize me... at least he acted like he didn't. Second, call it a hunch or a vibe, but he's acting strangely for a strange cat."

"Okay, I'll look him up." said Melina. "I'll be with Daniel at the Civic Center tonight, so I'll see you there. If I have something, I can tell you about it then and there, and no one will be the wiser on why we're talking."

"Sounds like a plan." I said...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The side ballroom of the Civic Center, where the Policeman's Ball was held every year, was fitted with a stage at the far end, and large television monitors on either side of the stage. On both side walls were large banners that said "Yes!", meaning for the new Charter. People were already filing in, most of them politicians and people who worked for and with politicians. 

To the side of that room was a smaller room, which was being called the 'green room'. Inside that room, the Charter Commission members and their guests were sitting and watching the returns, mostly on the Public Access channel. Laura was here with me. Edward R. Steele and his wife, Professor Stephanie Steele, were also here, and Laura and Stephanie talked 'shop', i.e. about University things. I talked with Edna Carter and her husband, and the Rev. Joseph E. Williams and his wife, then those two couples fell into conversations and Edward and I talked Council matters.

Savannah Fineman was not married, so she talked with Sheriff Griswold, then with a number of reporters and other politicians; I suspected groundwork for her own campaign for Solicitor was being established. I knew that Paulina Patterson was in the crowd outside, as was Miriam Walters. Teresa and Todd, and Cindy and Callie were also mingling with the crowd. And in case you're wondering, Molly Evans and Maggie Ross were watching the kids, dogs, and cats at The Cabin.

Some of the Council Members came through, as did the Mayor and his lovely wife. I shook hands with Daniel, and then Melina gave me a warm hug, which I admit stirred my loins a little bit. She whispered "I've got some stuff for you; let's talk when we get a chance." I said we would in a few minutes.

"The NEA set up a party of their own down the hallway." said the Sheriff. "I guess we'll find Kelly Carnes and half of the Heritage Cloisters subdivision in there." 

"Tell ya what." I said. I got on my personal cellphone and called Keith Madden of the <i>Town & County Examiner.</i> "Keith!" I said when he answered. "Do me a favor, if you will: get good footage of who is attending the NEA party. You can walk through there... no, I probably am not welcome in there... yes, something good will come your way, and Alison's way... okay, thanks."

Hanging up, I said to the Sheriff: "See? I don't hate <i>all</i> the Media."

"Har." the Sheriff barked. "Okay, you go talk to Melina. I'll talk to Savannah and the Mayor, and keep 'em distracted."

"How?..." I began to ask, but the Sheriff cut me off.

"You ain't the only one in here that can observe and deduce, Crowbar." the Sheriff growled. "Our resident Supervisory FBI Agent keeps looking your way, and its anxiety on her face, not love."

"I better find out what's bothering her, then, if you'll excuse me." I said. I went over to Melina and we went out the back door into the service hallway and found two chairs to sit on and chat. Unknown to me, Daniel Allgood, Sheriff Griswold, and Savannah Fineman began a discussion that would have ramifications for the future...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Melina said quietly "I looked into that Bob Stevens guy, and I dug deep. He's not undercover for anyone. He's never been a Federal Agent nor associated with the Federal Government as a C.I. or anything else. Ditto that for this State and the States that border ours."

"Good." I said. "That mean's he's got no excuse for being a weirdo, nor for being at Point Hollow."

Melina said "I looked into the lawsuits against him. He <i>has</i> run cult-like camps in different places, including around Lake Amengi-Nunagen and Lake Watchacoochie. But not like the Davidian compound or Mr. Kool-Aid Jim Jones; there never was a complaint about being forced to stay in a place. The lawsuits were over money that was paid but services not rendered nor the money given back. The curious thing is that Stevens won every one of the cases."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 5|
--------------------------------------------
I said "So he's harmless?"

"Relatively, as far as the Federal Government can tell." Melina said. "But he hasn't even come across their radar, at least not that I could find... and I can find just about anything, except McGinty's Materials."

"Those are as real as The Slender Man." I replied. "Okay, then. I appreciate you looking that up for me."

"There's one more thing." Melina said. "Captain Perlman is not an Agency of the Weak-Minded. She asked her fiancé, our SAC Jack Muscone, to look up Stevens. When I do it, no one will know about it. But Jack had his City Supervisory Agent Julius Jefferson look up Stevens, and it was an open search. My 'research' immediately saw that. They found what I found, but my point is that if someone is watching, they know who Stevens is by now."

"Hmmmm." I said. "Okay, thanks for telling me that, too. But it looks like this guy is just a nutjob, so unless he shows up at Point Hollow again, I'm not going to lose any sleep over him..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Everyone talked and ate from the buffet of finger foods, except me. I only drank Cherry Coca-Cola Zero, and did not eat anything. I realized I was a lot more keyed up and nervous than I'd expected to be.

"Relax, Don." said Edward Steele, coming to sit down beside me, also having made astute observations. "The votes are in, the die is cast, we win or lose. Nothing we can do about it now. I go through this every two years, and I've learned that 'it ain't a thang but a thang'."

"You're right." I said. "I've got a lot more on my mind than just this vote, but it'll be nice when it's all over. And I appreciate all your hard work on it, and guiding me through the shifting sands."

"And on behalf of everyone else, thank you for all your work on it." said Edward. "I don't think it would've gotten done without you leading it."

I made sure to share my sentiments of thanks to the other Commission members. After a lot more talk, I sat back and just observed people, and made some interesting deductions. That's what I do...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

At 10:00pm, KXTC came on with their news coverage: "This is Bettina Wurtzburg and Lester Holder at the Channel Two News Decision Desk!" said Bettina as she and Lester 'Penis Holder' sat at the anchor desk. "The votes are coming in, and it's too close to call. We do know that the northern suburbs are in, and the vote was 20% for and 80% against the new Charter. Numbers are still being tallied from the southern areas where minorities voted in huge numbers today..."

The second TV in the room (and on the big screens outside) was KFXU. Catrina and Meredith were behind a desk with their 'All-Star Panel' of Selena Steele, Alison McFarland, and surprisingly, Eldrick X. Weaver, who was well-behaved while on the air.

"So, Edward," I said, "how long before Selena takes over the bank from J.P. Goldman?" Edward, who was Selena's father, was wide-eyed with shock.

"How did you..." he gasped. Then he said "You really are almost as good at Carole at reading our minds."

"Not even close." I said. "But Selena's presence on that news panel, and her confidence and clarity are cluuuuuues. So what's going on?"

"After that poisoning incident," Edward said in a low tone (<i>Author's note: 'Casting Aspersions', Ch. 02.</i>), "J.P. has become really embittered at the Democrats. It was the plan all along to hand over the reins to Selena as the bank CEO, but J.P. sped up the timetable. He also wants Selena to run for his Council seat, and she's thinking about it a lot, and very positively. J.P. plans to devote all his remaining life and energy into defeating and destroying bastards and bitches like Reginald Lewis and Kelly Carnes."

I nodded, then Edward asked "So tell me... what's going on with the D.A. Office situation?"

I told him about D.A. Walters's plans to reorganize the D.A.'s Office, then finished with: "Miriam Walters will either step into the cow patty... or she won't. We'll just have to wait and see." Edward nodded.

At 10:30pm, my phone rang. It was the Superintendent of the Board of Elections, who oversaw the counting of the votes and certified the results, making her the second-most powerful person in the County, after the Intendent Adele Peabody. It suddenly got quiet in the 'green room' as everyone realized who I was talking with.

"Mmm hmm..." I said. "Mmm hmm... I see... okay... yeah, release it whenever you're ready... okay, thanks for calling."

I hung up, and seeing all the people looking at me I said solemnly, my eyes downcast: "That was the Superintendent of the Board of Elections. The results are in, and certified..."

<b>Part 11 - The Results</b>

"It wasn't even close." I said forlornly. Everyone groaned, but some were still watching me most very closely, especially Our Sheriff.

I couldn't hold it back any longer. I grinned and said "Only the Sheriff won by a wider margin than we did; the new Charter passed, 61.8% to 38.2%."

The room erupted into applause. Then the roar of applause in the main room outside could be heard as KFXU announced the results: "And the results are in!" said Catrina Pierce. "The new Town & County Charter passed by a strong margin of almost 62% voting in favor, while 38% voted against..."

There was much hugging and shaking of hands as we all celebrated. And then everyone but the Commission Members left and joined the now-large audience in the main room. Sheriff Griswold and Daniel Allgood walked to the podium, to large cheers.

"It's a great night for our Town & County!" said the Sheriff. "And now let's bring out the group that made it happen. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Charter Commission!"

I don't know why, but I had a fleeting flashback of being in a line to jump out of a perfectly good aircraft as we lined up to go through the door and on stage. The Rev. Williams went first, followed by Edna Carter, then me in the middle, then Edward Steele, then Savannah Fineman. The applause was huge, and the lights in our faces were bright, making it a bit hard to see.

Per prior arrangement, Town & County Councilman Edward R. Steele went up to speak for us. "Thank you all for coming, and for your support in this process, and getting it through the vote. We could not have done this without you!" Everyone cheered.

Then Mayor Allgood came up. "We asked these five Citizens to take on a tremendous task. They devoted hours of their time over several months, and worked tirelessly to produce a new Charter that will govern our lives for years to come. On behalf of the Council, the Assembly, and the People of the Town & County, as Mayor I would like to give you these tokens of our esteem."

Five young persons brought out five plaques, engraved on a silver (or chrome) plate with a wood background, that commemorated and thanked us for our service in the successful completion of writing the new Charter. The Mayor called out each name, and the audience cheered as they went up to receive their plaques. Mine was last.

"And last, but certainly not least," said the Mayor, "the Commission Chairman who put it all together and led the Commission to the successful completion of its goal, Don Troy!" Everyone cheered as I went up and received my plaque, which was like the others except for two things: it noted me as Chairman, and there were 'J' hooks attached to the bottom that curved forward.

The Mayor invited me to speak. I went up to the microphone and said "This was truly a team effort. My four colleagues on the Commission gave up hours of their time to work on this, and worked very well together out of diverse backgrounds to write this Charter for you." The audience cheered.

I continued: "And we had help from so many of you. We received input from many of you that took the time to attend our hearings, and that input was so valuable to us. I know that Mrs. Carter greatly appreciates the input from the County's teachers---" A huge round of applause broke out; I now knew where all the teachers in the room were.

"The input from our teachers was greatly helpful." I said. "I also appreciate the help of a great man, who has forgotten more than most of us will ever even know about this County's history, Sheriff Antonio Griswold!" Very loud applause for Our Sheriff. 

"Thank you for your help, and for your votes." I said to finish, and began stepping back. I did not get far. And it did not take much deduction to know why those hooks were in my plaque.

The Reverend Williams had come up and put his hand on my shoulder to keep me in place. He said "If I may, Mr. Mayor..." he said. Daniel extended his hand towards the podium, and the Rev. Williams came up and said "No one worked harder on this Charter than our Chairman, Donald Troy." Applause broke out, then Williams continued: "Don Troy guided us through these waters and herded the cats, and the strength of his leadership is what led to our success. So on behalf of my fellow Charter Commission Members, I'd like to present you with this token of our esteem."

He held up a crowbar, only about a foot long and thin. But it was plated in brilliantly silvery chrome, and was designed to fit and hang under the plaque on the hooks. I accepted the crowbar and held it up for all to see as the audience applauded. Rev. Williams extended his hand, but that was not enough. I hugged him, then hugged the other four Commission members.

Then I went back to the podium. "This is technically our last Charter Commission meeting, and I announce that the Charter Commission is adjourned <i>sine die!</i>..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Our formal celebration party would be Thursday evening. The party began breaking up right after our speeches. I was quickly surrounded by the Press for comment, and I tried to bore them by saying the successful result was due to my Commission teammates and the People of the County. I didn't really answer the questions they were hurling at me.

It was after midnight when we finally got home to The Cabin. Teresa and Todd had come by and picked up their boys. After a few minutes of talk about the vote results, Molly and Maggie went to the other bedrooms to get some sleep. Paulina was already here, and staying for the night in the master bedroom with Laura and me.

Laura went up to bed, and I went out on deck with a celebratory single malt Scotch. As I sat in my usual place, watching the stars in the sky and the twinkling lights of the Town in the valley below me, I crossed my legs in the 'English' style, like a figure-4... 

*<i>PLOP!</i>*

I looked down to see that Tiger Mom had jumped up onto my lap, and was now lying her body in a circle around my legs. I could feel that she was perfectly balanced, and I thought to myself that cats must just know how to do that. I began gently stroking her, and was rewarded with some of the loudest purring I'd ever heard; it was like a powerful motor somewhere inside her. 

It was the first time Tiger Mom had ever let me pet her, and I availed myself of the opportunity for a long while...

<b>Part 12 - Discipline</b>

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Wednesday, September 25th, from the rooftop of the building at Riverside and College, with the Civic Center across Courthouse Square as the background. "The new Town & County Charter is now in effect!"

Bettina began: "In a stunning surprise result, the Town & County Charter proposal passed by a 61-38% margin, despite less than 20% approval in the northern County suburbs. We have with us Karl Frazier of Public Policy Polling to break it down for us. Karl!"

"Thank you, Bettina." said Karl Frazier from what looked like a political 'war room' in KXTC studios. "As you said, the overall result was 61.8 to 38.2 percent for the new Charter. The dismal results in the northern suburbs was more than offset by large approval majorities in the middle-class and relatively poor districts. Also, blacks voted for the Charter in surprisingly large numbers."

Bettina: "Karl, can you tell us why minorities voted for the Charter, when it does away with Boards of Inquiry that protected minorities from Police brutality?"

Frazier: "Bettina, our exit polling showed that the overwhelming reason stated by minority voters yesterday was the new School Board. Blacks valued better education for their children over all other issues."

Bettina said "Thank you, Karl!" then to the viewers: "Not everyone was happy about the result last night. Roll tape."

Tape rolled, showing one of the leaders of the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union, saying in a speech at the losing gathering the night before: "Tonight was a devastating defeat for our hardworking teachers, and for education in the Town & County. But the NEA will continue the fight on behalf of our teachers and our children!" The tape cut off so that the weakness of the applause was not shown.

Bettina: "And in other news, Fire Chief Patrick Quinlin has called for a Press Conference at 8:00am, but did not give details of what it would be about. Sheriff Antonio Griswold had previously called for a Press Conference at 9:00am. KXTC will cover both Press Conferences."

Bettina: "The new Charter is now the cornerstone of the law, but many of its new provisions will not go into effect until January 1st. The Town & County Council will meet tonight, and they are expected to call for elections for the new School Board, Inspector General, and other newly created positions. These elections will be non-partisan free-for-alls, and will be on Election Day, Tuesday, November 5th. Runoff elections, if needed, will be on Tuesday, November 26th. Those wishing to run in the election must register no later than 5:00pm, Tuesday, October 8th."

Bettina: "And Channel Two News has learned that the Council may also ratify the new Police structure so that rank changes and promotions can take place on November 1st, if not sooner. They may also exercise a clause in the new Charter that will allow the Fire Department to use traditional bugle insignia of rank as well as gold insignia instead of silver in some instances. The Sheriff's Department will also receive those exceptions..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Chief Quinlin's presser? What's that about?" I asked as we drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room.

"I'm not sure." said Chief Moynahan. "The Sheriff is not here now because he said he had called Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker to his office for a meeting at 8:00am. Looks like Quinlin doesn't want to be therrrrre."

"Looks like Chief Quinlin is trying to get a jump on things." said Cindy Ross. "I'll bet he announces his immediate retirement, so he can collect his pension."

"He can tryyyyyy..." said Chief Moynahan.

"What about Battalion Chief Tucker?" Teresa Croyle asked. "He only has 18 years, and no MOV upon which he can base a retirement claim."

"He's going to be summarily fired." said the Chief. "The Sheriff may give Quinlin the option to retire, but if he's not at that meee-tinnng..."

"So, Don," said Cindy, "congratulations on the Charter. How do you feel?"

"Thanks" I said. "I feel... well, mostly relieved. But it feels a lot like our criminal cases. We work on it, we finish it, and that's that and we move on to the next case."

"And your next case," said the Chief, "is our meeting with D.A. Walters at 11:00am. I had invited her to lunch, but she said she preferred to meet here at the Police Station."

"That's so she can get up and leave if you start giving her any lip about whatever she's going to do." Teresa Croyle very astutely said.

"I am surrrre," purred the Chief, "that both of my Crowbar Commanders will be on their very best behav-yorrrrr..."

"Yes sir." I said. "My very best behavior." Somehow, I don't think that gave the Chief a warm and fuzzy feeling.

Just then there was a knock on the door. It opened to reveal Lt. Jerome Davis. "Commander Troy," he said, "can you come to MCD for a moment?"

"Uh, sure." I said. I did notice as I followed Jerome into the hallway that the Chief and my Angels were following us.

And when we got to MCD, I knew why. When I came in, a large contingent of Detectives burst into a round of applause. Precinct Captain Hewitt and Lieutenant Rudistan were there, also. Along with doughnuts, there was a cake that had been brought in, a nice caramel cake. In white icing on the top, it said "Congrats on the Charter!"

"Aw, thanks guys." I said. "And I gotta admit: I need the sugar rush, so cut me a piece of that cake!" Everyone cheered, and a small morning party commenced.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

At 8:00am, my Angels and I were in my office. I turned on the monitor to KFXU.

"And here's Chief Quinlin to speak now." Priya Ajmani said. The camera turned to focus upon Fire Chief Quinlin, who was standing in front of Fire Department Headquarters.

"The People have spoken." said Chief Quinlin. "I accept their decision and the result of their vote. But I cannot in good conscience abide by the decision to create a new EMS that is not under the full and complete control of the Fire Department. Therefore, I have submitted my resignation and my papers to retire, effective immediately. I want to thank the Officers and Firefighters of this great Fire Department for their support while I had the honor to serve as their Chief. I'll be taking no questions at this time."

As he walked back into Fire Department Headquarters, the camera turned back to Priya, who said: "And there you have it! Chief Quinlin has resigned over the creation of a new EMT service..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

At 9:00am, Sheriff Griswold came out the front doors of City Hall to the 'front porch', as it was colloquially called, and to the podium upon which rested a bank of microphones. A gaggle of Press were in a semi-circle in front of him.

"Thank you for coming." growled Griswold. "I am announcing that I am not accepting Fire Chief Quinlin's resignation, and am putting on hold his retirement papers. This is for the purpose of bringing up Chief Quinlin on several charges, which include insubordination, as well as wearing his Fire Department uniform for a political ad with the intent to be seen as representing the Fire Department. I have begun the process of firing Chief Quinlin as well as summarily firing Battalion Chief Tucker. As part of that, Chief Quinlin will be stripped of his pension. What are your questions regarding this situation?"

"Sheriff!" shouted Priya, "why didn't you take action immediately after Fire Chief Quinlin made that ad?"

"The ensuring controversy might have affected the plebiscite on the new Charter." growled Griswold. "That would not have been fair to the People of the County nor the Charter Commission that worked their butts off writing the new Charter. So I delayed taking action until today."

"If the Charter had failed to pass," asked an Indian reporterette that no one recognized, "would you still have fired them?"

"Yes." said the Sheriff. "I only delayed the action so that a fair vote on the Charter could be held. The result was not an issue, just the timing."

"Do you expect the Fire Captain's Union to grieve your actions, Sheriff?" said Bettina Wurtzburg.

"If they do, we'll deal with it at that time." said Griswold.

"Sheriff, who will you be naming to the Fire Chief position?" asked Keith Madden.

"I'll be making a nomination to the Council soon." said Griswold. "Assistant Fire Chief Davies is Acting Chief in the interim."

"Sheriff, do you expect the Firefighters to strike over the creation of a new EMS?" shouted Bettina.

"No." said the Sheriff. "A strike would be illegal, and I would fire any strikers. And any Firefighter that does not like the new EMS can signify so by raising their hand and saying 'I resign.'."

"Sheriff, who are you going to name as the new EMS Chief and Assistant Chief?" shouted Priya.

"We'll be having an announcement on that soon." said Sheriff Griswold. "I've already got some people in mind, and I just need to get them to accept my offers,. Then we'll go to the Council with the names."

"Sheriff, will you support a Board of Inquiry for Commanders Troy and Ross regarding the accusations of Police brutality in the wake of the attacks on AFC Davies and his fiancée?" asked Bill Hacosta.

"As far as I'm concerned, my Police Officers acted properly and did not use excessive force to apprehend the alleged attackers, who we know have ties to the NEA, the powerful Teacher's Union." growled Griswold. "The Council will have to call for a Board of Inquiry."

With that, the Sheriff said "Thank you, everyone." and walked back into City Hall. Within an hour, the Fire Department Captain's Union filed a grievance on behalf of Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker.

<b>Part 13 - Reward and Punishment</b>

11:00am, Wednesday, September 25th. District Attorney Miriam Walters entered Police Headquarters and was escorted to the Main Conference Room. Already present were Police Chief Moynahan, Deputy Chief Ross, Police Commander Troy (me), and Captain of Detectives Tanya Perlman. The Chief was sitting at his usual place at the near end of the table. Cindy was to his left, and I was to hers. Miriam Walters sat to the Chief's right, her back to the door, and Tanya to her right.

"Thank you for coming, Ms. Walters." said the Chief after Miriam sat down. "The Sheriff sends his regrets; he's putting out fires in the Fire Department, pun fully in-tenn-dedddd."

"I understand, and thank you for having me." said Walters, who did not even crack a smile at the Chief's joke. "And congratulations, Commander Troy, on the Charter passing."

"Thank you." I said politely. "ADA Fineman contributed greatly to its success."

"Yes, she did very well." Walters said, making me feel like I'd made a mistake in praising Fineman.

Getting right down to business, Walters said "The reason I'm here today is to let you know the changes I'm making to the District Attorney's Office. These changes bring us into line with many other D.A. offices in the State, and some of them will affect our interactions with the Police Force, especially the Detectives."

"Do you have a presentation that you need to connect to our screen?" asked the Chief.

"No, it's verbal." said Miriam. She settled in, then started: "First, I'm hiring two Investigators. As you know, they will not be full Law Enforcement Officers, but they can and will investigate new leads we might develop in cases that have come to us from you, question or re-question witnesses or other people, work to clarify situations as needed, and help prep witnesses for trial."

She looked around the room, possibly not having expected the silence that greeted her. I noticed she kept glancing towards me out of the corner of her eye, as if judging my reaction. I was keeping my face a mask of iron passivity.

"No comments?" asked Walters.

Tanya took up the bit: "Please just make sure we know who they are, and that they work with us and not at cross-purposes. I don't want them and our people stepping on each other's toes."

Chief Moynahan said "I hope you'll consider having them work with Sheriff Grizzzzwold. He will teach them everything from crime scenes to questioning people, just as he teaches our De-tec-tives."

Miriam said "That's a good idea. Also, per the State Code, our Investigators can get warrants for your Officers as well as Sheriff's Deputies." I worked hard not to glance at Tanya; that was a big part of her desire to bringing an Intelligence Division into existence.

"The second part concerns the structure of the District Attorney's Office." said Walters. "It is common, especially in this State, to have Deputy District Attorneys as the main prosecutors working with Law Enforcement and in the Courts, and for Assistant DAs to be supervisors and the DA's representatives, so to speak. Because of potential... 'optics' issues, I believe the best way to go about this restructuring is to have every current Assistant DA be re-designated Deputy DAs. At some point in the future, supervisory ADA roles would be filled as needed."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
Miriam continued: "As an example from the past, after the Merger there were two Police positions that were not filled at the time: Commander and Deputy Chief. Over time, as the Police Force grew along with the Town & County, those positions were effectively filled. That probably should've happened with the DA's office, but they named them ADAs instead of DDAs. So we're just following some precedent in all this."

I again had noted that Miriam had glanced over towards me every few seconds, to see how this was going over with me. As she finished, she was understanding the concept of the silence in the room being 'deafening'." I also noted that everyone else had been glancing over at me, and I was getting the sense that Cindy was really trying to reach into my mind and read me.

"Any comments?" asked the Chief, looking right at me. But it was Cindy who spoke first.

"When will you be making promotions to ADA from DDA?" Cindy asked, her voice sounding calm, but her ice blue eyes boring into Miriam Walters's beady black peepers showing otherwise.

"That will be months down the road." Miriam said. "And not until it's determined that there is a need for that layer of supervision."

Then Walters attempted another line: "One other thing... you and your Detectives will be working with our DDAs, not future ADAs, once this is put in place. I know you have your opinions on who is best, and I'm not here to argue that with you. But by making this change now, you get to continue to work with the same people. They just have different titles and locations on the org chart."

She's trying, I thought to myself. She's a good politician; she's twisting the English language around to suit her agenda. She's even clutching at the straws of examples of my own promotion to suit her cause. But it's an insult to my intelligence to tell me that demoting Paulina is the best if not only way we get to continue to work with her. Fortunately for her, the Chief asked and the Sheriff ordered me to 'be nice'.

All eyes were now on me, and I knew I had to speak. I said "I've been asked to be nice, so I won't ask what happens if Savannah Fineman loses the Solicitor race to Ted Mason again. What I <i>will</i> say is this."

I straightened up in my chair and said (calmly) "Something I learned in the Army, as well as in my first civilian job, was that <i>you can always give more, but to take away creates enmity.</i> If you give someone a raise, that's good, they'll be loyal. But if you come back a month later and say 'we have to take your raise away', you'll create enmity, and disloyalty will result."

I continued: "And not just with the person you're taking from. You'll create enmity, or at least distrust, with those who remain. Most of them will wonder in the back of their minds if they're next, or if more will be demanded of them if they get to keep their raises."

"You made the example of my own promotion." I said. "Let me counter with another example from the Police Force: when we restructured to align the Detective ranks more similarly to other Police Forces in the State and the Nation, we did not demote anyone. At all. Those who were Senior Detectives, which outranks Sergeants, were left in those positions, and they're grandfathered in. The new structure only applies to new, incoming Detectives. By doing that, we did not create ill will within the Detective Corps."

"And sometimes nothing works to prevent enmity." I said. "When the Fire Department Battalion Chief position was scheduled to be reduced to the same level with Superintendents, we made clear it would not apply to the current Battalion Chiefs. But they still whined about it. So we went the other way; we upgraded the Superintendent position. The Battalion Chiefs whined about that. And then we raised the AFC and Fire Marshal positions, and the Battalion Chiefs called that a demotion of the Battalion Chiefs."

"My point to all this," I finished up, "is that if you take away, if you demote, if you elevate others and leave someone behind, or even just the appearance of it, you create enmity. And a plague of boils ensues. The Fire Department is about to erupt into chaos. And I believe it's the same with your ADAs... or could be. You have four left: Washington, Patterson, Fineman, and Gregory. If you demote any or all of them, you will create enmity, ill will, and not just with them. Make the structural changes if you wish. But don't take away from anyone, or leave them behind."

The Chief and Cindy were nodding vigorously in support of my words. Tanya's eyes were sparkling, which I knew meant she approved. However, I might as well have been talking to a slab of black marble as I looked into Miriam Walters's beady black eyes... as I saw that my words had no effect... or perhaps less than zero effect... on her.

"Thank you for your input, Commander." Walters said icily. Then she said to everyone "That's all I have. If any of you know anyone that might be a good Investigator for us, send me their résumé."

"Thank you for coming by, Ms. Walters." said the Chief. "I look forward to working with your new people." He got up, then the rest of us did, indicating the meeting was 'ovah'. He personally escorted the District Attorney to the front lobby...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Thank yooooo, Mr. Crowbar," said the Chief, "for not taking the District Attorney's head, even though she would have very much deserved it."

The Chief, Cindy, and I were eating lunch in the 'command' back room of the Cop Bar, which we had to ourselves; there was no one from the Fire Department's leadership in the room. I was having the Double Breakfast Cheeseburger Plate, Cindy was having the Fish and Chips basket, and the Chief was consuming a massive Chicken Salad.

Cindy said "And what you said was very good, maybe the best thing you <i>could</i> have said to her."

"I did not like it that she was trying to use <i>yooooo</i> as her example to demote the ADAs." said the Chief.

"Neither did I." said Cindy. In case you're wondering, I was not answering because I was stuffing my face with the delicious burger that had been expertly cooked to my most very happy satisfaction. 

I finally said "Walters was just practicing her political skills, which are considerable. But she was clutching at straws, really reaching to make justifications for what she truly wants to do. And she did not like it one bit that I countered her example with one of my own."

"Do you think you changed her mind, at all?" Cindy asked.

"I may have delayed the inevitable." I said. "But that's all. She's going to do what she wants to do. But I'm not really concerned about that right now. I'm wondering what's going on with the Fire Department. And we have the Council meeting tonight. I will make my public report that the Charter is passed, and with that the Charter Commission will cease to be."

"I can tell you where the Fire Department is." growled the voice of Sheriff Griswold, followed by him coming up to our table. "If I can join you, that is."

"By all means, Sheriff." said the Chief. "Have some fries until you can order."

"I placed my order at the bar." said the Sheriff, taking some fries anyway. "As to the Fire Department, the Union grieved my actions to disallow Quinlin's retirement and to fire him without a pension, and to summarily fire Tucker. Both are suspended without pay. I thought it would take some time, but the Union agreed to meet with us and decide things tomorrow morning."

"That's good." said Chief Moynahan. "They're not going to wait for the Council to have input? Or a Board of Inquiry?"

"Who knows what the Council is going to do." growled the Sheriff. "My sources tell me that the Union knows they're going to lose, so they want to get it overwith and move forward. I suspect they want to force themselves to be the EMT's Union, as well. So... as you like to say, Crowbar: <i>teachable moment!</i> What would you two young whippersnappers do if you were me?"

Cindy said quickly and with alacrity: "I'd rip them both new ones, and fight the Union all the way. You can't let the insubordination go, Sheriff, and you delayed it for the election. If it were me, I'd bring the hammer down, and take Quinlin's pension away. I'd fire Tucker, and take away his years of service towards his pension, so that he can't get a County job for two years and get a pension."

The Sheriff nodded, then turned to me and said "Crowbar?"

I said "You might be surprised to hear this, Sheriff, but I might not act too hastily. First, I would hammer Tucker. Like Commander Ross said, I'd summarily fire him, and in such a way that if he gets another County job, his years with the TCFD cannot count towards a pension. Maybe even bust him down to Firefighter Apprentice and then put a boot in his ass."

"As to Chief Quinlin," I continued, "it depends on several factors. His years and record of service vs. the seriousness of this incident; how the Fire Department overall is going to take whatever you end up doing to him; and finally, the Union negotiation tomorrow."

I finished: "If it were me, I'd go in guns-blazing, then do the back and forth with the Union and work them down to my ultimate goal of allowing Quinlin his pension, but at a reduced rank, such as Captain... kind of like what Chief Moynahan did to Della Harlow. In exchange, the Union throws Tucker under the bus and you make a huge example of him."

"I like that." said Griswold. "And that's likely what is going to happen."

At that moment, the Sheriff's Double Cheeseburger Plate came, and we talked Police 'shop' as we ate our meals...

<b>Part 14 - Ranks and Files</b>

7:30pm, Wednesday, September 25th. I was in civilian clothes, though with my badge on my belt and my holstered gun under my armpit under the suit jacket. Teresa Croyle was in her 'black' uniform. We didn't know if there would be trouble tonight, and it was possible a lot of 2nd Shift Patrol Officers were patrolling right near City Hall.

I noticed that the crowd filing in was fairly large. There were a large number of blacks of various ages, but very few of them were wearing red t-shirts; most were nicely dressed. There were also a good number of people I recognized as schoolteachers. And there were a few unkempt persons, mostly young and white, wearing green PCGW t-shirts.

"What's with all the schoolteachers?" I asked Teresa.

"If you don't know, sir, I sure don't." Teresa replied.

"Well, keep your eyes peeled." I said. "It might be some NEA protest. If anything starts up, I want it shut down very, very quickly."

"Roger that, sir." Teresa replied, very eager to implement those instructions should it become necessary.

The Council Members filed in and took their seats. Mayor Allgood addressed the audience: "Because of the passage of the new Charter last night, we're going to have a lot of work to do tonight. So we're not going to have speakers address the Council tonight, except for the one that is required by law to do so. If you have an issue that needs quick redress, please fill out one of the forms in back, and someone will contact you."

The Mayor called for the lawsuits and other papers to be presented, and they were moved along. Then he said "Charter Commission Chairman Don Troy is recognized to speak."

I moved to the central podium and said "It is my duty and my pleasure to report to you that the new Charter was approved by a vote of the People of the Town & County yesterday. I have submitted a written report of the Charter Commission's actions, as well as another report that outlines what the Council needs to do in preparation for the implementation of the new Charter. And with this report to you, I am pronouncing the mission of the Charter Commission completed, and that the Commission is herewith dissolved."

The Mayor said "Without objection, enter that into the record." There were no objections. The Mayor said "Chairman Troy, on behalf of the Town & County Council, Assembly, and People, I thank you and your Commission for your hard work and the successful result of it."

Someone began clapping, and soon everyone was standing up and applauding. The people in the audience that were teachers were the first to rise up out of their seats, and the blacks in the audience did, as well. I would learn later that they were so happy with the School Board that they came to the meeting just to applaud me.

But it was not all good: the green-shirted environmentalist punks of the PCGW did not sand up, and I noted that Kelly Carnes and Malinda Adams stood but did not join in the applause...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Work began being done. The Council ratified the call for an election of newly created positions on Election Day, to fill a one-year term until the regular election, after which the terms would be two years, like most Town & County elected offices. The elections would be 'jungle style', where everyone runs on one ballot, with political affiliation listed by the person's name, and the top two in a runoff unless one person got 50% + 1 votes.

"I move," said Reginald B.F. Lewis, "to go into Executive Session, for the purpose of bringing back up and discussing the proposed promotions within the Police and Fire Departments. The Sheriff has also submitted names for the leadership of the new EMS, which will require ratification."

"Without objection?" said the Mayor. There was one objection, by J.P. Goldman, who requested and required a recorded vote. That vote was 10-0; Goldman was just being ornery. "Will Commander Troy and Captain Croyle join us?" said the Mayor...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I don't know how he did it, but as I walked into the private Council Chamber and turned sideways to sit down in one of the chairs against the left side wall, Sheriff Antonio Griswold had appeared out of nowhere and had come in right behind me. He sat down next to me, to my right. Teresa was on my left side, and the Sergeant-At-Arms was sitting a couple of seats down from the Sheriff.

"Can we get a report from the Sheriff on the status of the Fire Department, please?" asked Kelly Carnes. The Mayor looked over at Sheriff Griswold, who nodded and came up to the podium at the far (from the doors) end of the table.

"The Union grievance will be heard tomorrow morning." growled Griswold. "It is very likely that at the end of that meeting, the Fire Department will need a new Chief. I am submitting Assistant Chief Warren Davies to you for promotion to Fire Chief, in the event the vacancy comes open tomorrow."

Mayor Allgood said "I think we may have to wait until the vacancy is assured, meaning we'll ratify it next Tuesday, unless you guys want to have a special session." There were murmurs of general agreement over that.

Reginald B.F. Lewis then said "We have received a formal complaint as well as a lawsuit concerning TCPD excessive use of force in the arrest of six persons who attacked AFC Davies and his lady friend. While the initial motion to call for a Board of Inquiry was defeated, I am making a new motion---"

"Point of order!" snarled J.P. Goldman. "We voted that down already."

"The initial BOI request, yes." said Susan Weston. "But a new request based on the lawsuit would be considered a separate item."

"And I second that motion." said Kelly Carnes.

"You were not recognized, Mrs. Carnes." said the Mayor woodenly. "Let's get the legalities of this straight first."

"Here's a precedent." said Malinda Adams, sliding a file folder across the table to the Mayor. Daniel Allgood examined the contents.

"I have a different Point of Order." said Dagmar Schoen. "With the new Charter passed, aren't Boards of Inquiry a thing of the past, now?"

"No." I said, speaking up. "Though I'll be the object of the BOI, I'm compelled to say that the Boards of Inquest are part of the new Inspector General's Department. An Inspector General must be elected, and in general the Boards of Inquest won't be in effect until January 1st. So until then, it'll still be the old way of doing things."

"You're too damn honest for your own good, Crowbar." growled the Sheriff.

"It is what it is, Sheriff." I quietly replied. Then I spoke more loudly: "But I'll remind everyone that the Police Union will grieve any BOI that includes Finneran in any capacity based upon new evidence against him, and it'll be tied up for months. That's not a threat, just predicting the future."

"Commander Troy and his cover-up Union won't have a choice." said Kelly Carnes. "So what are you going to do, Mayor? Are we just going to sit here all night?

"Mind your tone, Mrs. Carnes." Mayor Allgood said flatly as he finished reading the material. "Yes, this case from several years ago might be a precedent, but it also could have been a wrong precedent. I think we need to get an opinion from the City Attorney."

"Why don't we come back to this?" said Reginald B.F. Lewis. "Since my motion was not seconded, I withdraw it." Teresa and I glanced at each other; we could both tell Lewis had something up his sleeve.

"Okay, let's talk about the Police structure, which will include some promotions." said Mayor Allgood. "The way this works is that the new Charter requires that all Precinct Captains are automatically promoted to full Captain at the New Year, and Supervisors and brevetted Lieutenant are promoted to full Lieutenant. Our mission, if we choose to accept it, is to make those promotions effective November 1st, if not sooner. Any particular date you'd like, Commander Troy?"

"October 1st." I said. "We have to have new badges made, and that'll take a few days."

"Including yours, Commander?" asked Reginald B.F. Lewis derisively.

"Including mine." I replied, not rising to the bait. When Teresa looked at me quizzically, I whispered "Tell you later." She nodded.

"Does this include the promotion to Operations Commander?" asked Susan Weston, also derisively.

"If you pass the new rank structure, yes." I replied.

"If this doesn't pass," said Sheila Sorrells, "will there be repercussions? Any problem for the Police Force?"

"Not really." I said. "But we like getting our candy, and Sheriff Griswold wants his four-star candy." Laughter erupted, and the Sheriff peered at me and then guffawed when he saw me grinning at him. Susan Weston looked furious; she knew that was a direct shot across the bow at her repeated comments about the TCPD giving out medals like candy.

"I'll tell you what." said Reginald B.F. Lewis. "I'll vote to pass this... as long as there's a provision in it to disperse the Detectives to the Precincts."

"Not gonna happen." I said. "And just so you know... even if you passed that, I'll just have all-day meetings and training sessions for the Detective at Headquarters. I will get around it. But it's not going to pass, because it will harm the Police Force... and only you and Mrs. Carnes actively want to harm the Police Force." That got me an ugly look from Carnes... but she did not deny it out loud.

"Why the hell not?" Lewis almost screamed. "What do you have against dispersing the Detectives? Why do you think that's such a bad thing?"

"Because if they're scattered like a covey of partridge across the County, they can't talk to each other face-to-face about their cases!" I all but yelled back. "They're a unit! a team!"

"I can wait until New Year's Day for my candy, Lewis." growled Griswold. "Your 'fake news' offer is a non-starter."

"How about this, then?" said Sheila Sorrells. "We pass the structure and promotions, effective October 1st.. if we get our Board of Inquiry."

"And Commissioner Finneran as lead examiner!" Kelly Carnes happily added...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"My badge says 'Commander'." I said to Teresa as we left after the meeting ended. "My new one will say 'Police Commander', since we now have Commander and Lt. Commander ranks, and 'Chief of Operations' and 'Commander of Operations' positions. So I'll be getting a new badge."
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 3|
--------------------------------------------
"What will my badge say?" asked Teresa. You can tell by the form of our sentences that the rank structure passed. So did the BOI referral.

"It will say 'Lt. Commander'." I said. "And congratulations, Commander of Operations Croyle!"

"And you're a star now... <i>literally.</i>" said Teresa, with as much of a grin as we were going to get from her. "And that was hilarious, what you said about the Sheriff wanting his candy."

"Damn right, I want that." said Sheriff Griswold, who was walking right alongside us back to Police Headquarters.

"Our Sheriff will now have the uniform he deserves, and that the People need to see." I quipped.

"You're going to look great, Sheriff." Teresa said, in an excellent display of asskissing.

"Har." said the Sheriff. "So what did you young whippersnappers think of my nominations for the EMS Chief and Assistant Chief?"

"The Assistant Chief did not surprise me." I said. "But you totally got me with the EMS Chief nomination. I had no idea that was coming..."

(<i>Author's note: Can you guess who the EMS Chief and Assistant Chief will be? Keep reading for the answers...</i>)

<b>Part 15 - Resolutions</b>

"This is Bettina Wurtzburg, KXTC Channel Two News!" shouted the redheaded MILF reporterette at 7:00am, Thursday, September 26th, from the rooftop of the building at Riverside and College. "Commander Troy will be required to face yet another Board of Inquiry regarding accusations of Police brutality!"

Bettina began: "The Council referred a complaint and an NEA lawsuit of Police brutality to a Board of Inquiry, to determine if Commander Donald Troy and Deputy Chief Cindy Ross used excessive force in arresting six protesters the Police said were assaulting Assistant Fire Chief Davies and another person. Some Council Members insisted that Commissioner Finneran be on the Board of Inquiry and the lead examiner, but it was not clear if that would actually happen."

Bettina droned on about the case, then finally got to other news: "We will be having breaking news throughout the day. Council Member Reginald B.F. Lewis will be issuing a statement this morning. Inspector General Horace S. Wellman, brother of University President Sidney P. Wellman, will hold a rally as he announces that he will be running for the I.G. post, which under the new Charter is an elected position in the newly independent Inspector General's Office."

Bettina: "District Attorney Miriam Walters will be holding a Press conference this morning to outline changes to the District Attorney's Office. Channel Two News has learned that one of those changes could be the demotion of ADA Paulina Patterson, who is black, in favor of ADA Savannah Fineman, who is white and a close friend of D.A. Walters."

Bettina: "And Sheriff Griswold will be holding a news conference this afternoon, from which we are expecting to hear a resolution to the punishment of Fire Chief Quinlin and Battalion Chief Tucker. The Union grieved the Sheriff's attempts to separate both men from the Fire Department, and the hearing will be this morning. Sheriff Griswold also said that he will reveal the names of the leadership of the new EMS leaders at the Press conference, which the Council approved last night, but redacted the names until they accept the nominations and are announced by the Sheriff."

Bettina: "And the Council passed a resolution to allow the branches of the Public Service Department to implement the new rank structure outlined in the new Charter on October 1st. Among those changes, the Battalion Chiefs are demoted to the equivalent of Superintendents instead of being on par with the Assistant Fire Chief and Fire Marshal. Also, Precinct Captains will now be full Captains in the Town & County Police Department..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

<i>*BRING!* *BRING!* *BRING!* *BRING!*</i>

It was my Police iPhone ringing as the Command Group and my Angels drank coffee in the Chief's Conference Room. "Hello, Ms. Walters." I said as I answered.

"Commander, did you tell Bettina that crap about me demoting Paulina?" Walters angrily asked.

"No, Ms. Walters." I said. "Scout's Honor, it wasn't me. And you know I don't speak to KXTC at all."

"Who the hell was it, then?" Walters practically shouted.

"If I knew, I would tell you." I said. "And I do wish I knew, because I hate leakers in the Police Department more than you can possibly know."

"All right, then." said Walters. "My apologies. And what that bitch Wurtzburg said is totally 'fake news'. She has no idea what I'm going to say."

"That's never stopped her from lying on the air before." I said. That lightened Miriam's mood considerably. She apologized again, told me to watch her news conference, then we disconnected.

"Wow." I muttered as I set the phone down on the table, and related to everyone what had been said.

"If you'd leaked that, Bettina would not have run with it." Tanya Perlman astutely said. "And judging by the racial overtones in the way Bettina reported it, she's trying to gin up something."

"The silver lining to this," said Cindy Ross, "is that judging by Miriam's phone call, she doesn't intend to demote Paulina."

Teresa replied "Or she <i>did</i> intend to do it, and now Bettina has laid the table to make a racial issue out of it."

"What do <i>you</i> think, Mr. Crowbarrrr?" drawled the Chief.

"I think..." I said, "... that I need more coffee, and we'll find out what Miriam has to say when she gives her Press conference." After pouring more coffee into my mug, and everyone else's that needed it, I said "Oh, one more thing: I had thought Reginald B.F. Lewis was going to resign days ago. But apparently he waited to see what the Charter vote would be, so I expect his presser today is to announce he won't run again."

"Good call, off on the timing." said Cindy. "But if you were perfect, you'd have been writing the Ten Commandments instead of the Charter." Amidst the laughter, a red crowbar was waved in her general direction.

"Did my proposal for an Intelligence Division get acted upon?" Tanya asked.

"Yes." I said. "It was submitted, and the Council referred it to the Committee of the Whole, which is their way of being able to get together and talk about something without having to go through the hoopla of, or most of the hoopla, of the Rules of Order, and having to keep transparency notes."

"Darn." Tanya said, her spirit deflating at the news. "I was hoping it'd sneak through."

"Don't be upset." I said. "There was a lot going on at that Council meeting last night. If they had to have done it last night, it would've failed. I think they really do want to consider it, and it'll get a fair shot."

"Does the Council even have to pass it?" Cindy asked. "Why can't the Chief do it unilaterally?"

I replied "Because it creates a new Lieutenant position, which will require the Council's approval to fill. And even though there was an anonymous gift to buy the equipment for it, the money has to be authorized to be spent, and the positions created. We can laterally move Lt. Mary Milton to the Intel Lieutenant slot, but then the Council has to approve whoever we put in the Vice slot..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

My Angels and I were watching in my office as Reginald B.F. Lewis came before the television cameras set up in the Atrium of City Hall. "Thank you for coming." said Lewis. "I am announcing today that I will not be running again for my seat on the Town & County Council. The actions of the racist, illegitimate Mayor and his sycophant Police Force have made it impossible for me to serve my constituents and protect their rights as minorities in a way they have a right to expect. As of now, I intend to serve out my current term on the Council, continuing the fight to stop the illegitimate Mayor's racist policies. I'll be taking no questions at this time. Thank you."

As we watched on TV as Lewis walked on into the secure areas of City Hall, ignoring the Press's shouted questions, I heard Tanya hiss "Yessss!"

"Are you the reason he's quitting?" asked Teresa to Tanya.

"Sure, I'll take the credit." Tanya said with a wicked grin.

"You can, but what he said to you was just one of the final straws that broke his back." I said. "I happen to have some inside information that Lewis knows he's been neutered by that suspended sentence hanging over his head like the Sword of Damocles. I think he'd just resign from the Council, but that would leave the Republicans with a 5-4 advantage until the next election."

"Miriam's presser is coming up at 9:00am." said Cindy.

Teresa said "Someone who shall remain nameless told me that Geiger said that he turned down Miriam's offer to be a D.A. Investigator because he, and I quote, 'didn't trust her motives'. He said that the way she asked questions as they discussed the job gave him a bad vibe about what she wanted him to do."

"Which is what?" I asked. "To go behind our backs in some way?"

Tanya spoke up and replied: "Or make sure we don't sabotage Savannah Fineman if and when Miriam demotes Paulina. And yes, I heard that about Geiger turning down the job, also..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

As the Union grievance hearing began in a room in City Hall, Senior Deputy Sheriff Louis Bailey, an older man that had been with the Sheriff's Department for over a quarter of a century, came up to one of the Union's lawyers, the 'Junior Adjutant' as he was derisively called. They began the negotiation...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

At 9:00am, Town & County District Attorney Miriam Walters went to the Press Room in City Hall. As the propagandists... er, journalists settled into their chairs, she said "Thank you for coming. This press conference will outline changes to the District Attorney's Office, which will bring our DA's Office into closer alignment with most of the others in the State."

Walters announced the new Investigator positions, then said "The other major change is with respect to Deputy DAs. All new hires of prosecutors and related attorneys will be Deputy DAs instead of Assistant DAs. The current Assistant DAs will remain in their positions, though there may be a shifting of roles."

Miriam then detonated the nuke: "I also want to say that this morning there was a news report that was not only false, but malicious in what I believe was an attempt to instigate racial tensions. KXTC's dishonest fake news was disgusting, and shows why journalists are one of the three most disrespected and despised professions in America. KXTC owes me, my Assistant DAs, and the People of this County a retraction and an on-air apology."

"<i>Hold your breath waiting for one!</i>" shouted Lester Holder, standing up. "We stand by our reporting! Just because you changed your mind to hide your racist intent doesn't mean we lied. We stand by our story! You owe <i>us</i> an apology!"

"Get that race-baiter out of here." said DA Walters. To Holder she said: "We have not forgotten the racist names you called my ADAs daughter, Holder. <i>And neither has the Iron Crowbar!</i>" There were gasps in the room as two Deputy Sheriffs came up. Holder did not resist, and willingly left with them...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"Wow." said Cindy as she and I watched in my office. "She backed off. Maybe what you said <i>did</i> have an effect."

"Yeah," I said, "she kicked the can down the road. But like I also said in the earlier meeting, we'll have to see what happens if Savannah Fineman loses the Solicitor election next year. Miriam is counting on Savannah winning that. I'm far less certain."

"How'd you like that exchange with Lester Holder?" Cindy asked with a gleam in her ice-blue eyes.

"I cannot believe he did that." I said. "I'm just wondering if he gets so triggered whenever Press dishonesty is called out that he just can't help himself."

"Just between us," said Cindy, "are you the one that leaked that to KXTC, in spite of what you told Miriam?"

"No." I said, shaking my head. "Seriously and genuinely, I am not the one." 

Cindy peered at me, then her eyes relaxed and she just nodded slightly. "So who do you think did leak it? Because I have reason to believe Miriam was going to go through with demoting all four ADAs. I really do suspect that Miriam backed off only after Bettina put that out there this morning."

"I don't know." I said. "There are a lot of logical candidates. We shall see what's going on with that..."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

I met Jack Muscone at the Cop Bar for lunch. "So now it's crazy for you guys while we Feds are sitting back and twiddling our thumbs." he said as we sat down.

I chuckled. "Yes, it is." I said. "But in a good way. And now we can concentrate on Tanya's plan for an Intelligence Division."

"You like that plan?" asked Jack. "I thought it was a good idea. The SRIC (State Regional Intelligence Center), like everything else that the SBI touches, is sketchy."

"True." I said. "And I've noticed a small but persistent increase in drug traffic flow into the County. It could really become an issue, and an Intel Unit could really be good to fight that. So what's going on Federally?"

Jack said "First, I wanted to say that I heard about Reginald B.F. Lewis not running again. I'm extremely glad to hear that, especially after what he said to Tanya. But it got my hackles up that he's not running again."

"He's hamstrung by that plea deal he made." I said. "If I were politically incorrect, I'd say he's made a lot of money for himself as a civil rights politician, and he's too much of a coward to put it on the line and risk jail time by violating that plea deal. He made the plea deal out of cowardice in the first place, as well. The only problem I have with him not running again is that we may get saddled with someone worse."

"That's true." said Jack. "And I wanted to apologize if we stepped on your toes over that Guru Stevens situation." said Jack. "Tanya asked me to do a routine check on him to make sure he wasn't one of our guys on an undercover mission. He's not, and as far as we can tell he's not undercover with anyone at all. But an issue came up: we found out that someone accessed our search on Stevens. We thought it was Melina... and yes, I know you asked her to look into Stevens... but it wasn't her. It was someone in Washington, D.C. Then the Rovers BAU unit started checking him out, and not being discreet about it at all."

"Hmmm." I said. "I guess I should be worried under the 'there are no coincidences in the Universe' concept, but since Stevens is just a nutjob wannabee cult leader, I don't feel like wasting any time on him."

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

2:00pm. Sheriff Griswold stepped onto the portico of City Hall and up to the bank of microphones. There were a good number of people to both sides of him, including Chief Moynahan, myself, Cindy, Teresa, AFC Davies, Fire Marshal Zoe Singer, and Fire Lieutenant Roy Easley, all in Duty Dress uniforms. Public Health Officer Beth Paige, University President Sidney P. Wellman, Dr. Richard Searles, and my wife Dr. Laura Fredricson were also in attendance. A gaggle of journalists faced the microphones.

"Thank you all for coming." said the Sheriff. "I have two major announcements today. First, we have come to an agreement with the Fire Captain's Union and Fire Chief Quinlin. Quinlin has accepted a deal whereby he will be demoted to Fire Captain, and he will be allowed to retire with his pension based upon a Fire Captain's salary. I made that offer based upon Quinlin's years of service to the Fire Department versus the violations he committed, and it was agreed to by all parties."

"In exchange," said the Sheriff, "the Fire Captain's Union withdrew its grievance of the disciplining of Battalion Chief Tucker. Tucker was stripped of his time-in-grade, meaning his time with the Fire Department cannot be counted towards a pension should he attain another County job. Tucker was also summarily fired from the Town & County Fire Department."

"As a result of the Fire Chief vacancy," continued Griswold, "I will be nominating Assistant Fire Chief Warren Davies for the Fire Chief post." All the crowd except the Press applauded. They didn't want to show anything but 'neutrality', of course.

Sheriff Griswold: "My other announcement is to name the new EMS Chief and Assistant Chief, which was ratified by the Council last night. Your next EMS Assistant Chief is a lateral transfer, as Fire Marshal Zoe Singer has agreed to take on the new role. Zoe would you please come up?" There was applause as Zoe came up to the podium, but we were wondering why the Sheriff had her come up before naming the EMS Chief. We found out quickly enough:

Sheriff Griswold said "I have a special award for Ms. Singer today. She has served our Town & County for many years as an EMT then as Fire Marshal. The Fire Marshal job is like Internal Affairs as well as investigating Arson crimes, and she set a very high bar with her examples of integrity and leadership. So it is my honor to present her today with the Public Safety Distinguished Service Award!"

There were 'oooh's and 'ahhhh's as the Sheriff pinned the third-highest award in the Public Safety Department on Zoe's uniform jacket, and everyone except the Press applauded.

"And now let's introduce your next EMS Chief." said Sheriff Griswold. "I feel very lucky to have gotten him to accept this post, but he's never backed away from a challenge. His hard work and examples of integrity throughout his career are of the highest caliber. He saw harrowing combat in Viet Nam, and was awarded the Navy Cross. He rose to the rank of Admiral, and has done wonderful work as our University Hospital's Administrator. And he has now agreed to take on the challenge of building a new EMS for us. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present your new EMS Chief, Admiral Leonard R. Cordell!"

We all erupted into applause as Dr. Cordell came up to the microphone and shook hands with the Sheriff. Griswold put him in front of the microphone, and he spoke in his gruff voice:

"Thank you, thank you." he said. As the applause abated, he said "I want to thank Sheriff Griswold for giving me this opportunity. I want to thank Zoe Singer for accepting the transfer to work with me in building for you the best EMS service ever!" Much applause.

"In taking this job," said Cordell, "in a way I am going back to my roots. I was a Navy Corpsman in Viet Nam, treating and evacuating wounded soldiers. Now I have the privilege of leading a team of people that will be treating injured persons and getting them to the medical care they require." More applause.

Cordell: "And while I was in Viet Nam, I had the honor of being attached to a distinguished unit led by a great, great man. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that saved an entire unit. And when his equally courageous and accomplished daughter, Captain... soon to be Commander... Teresa Croyle asked me to consider accepting this challenge, I just couldn't say no." 

There were gasps of surprise, and then applause started as Admiral Cordell looked over at Teresa and gave her a thumbs-up. I'm not sure how much of it Teresa saw... she had tears in her eyes. After a final "Thank you.", Cordell came over and gave Teresa a hug then stayed with us as Sheriff Griswold resumed the microphone.

"It's hard to follow that," growled Griswold, "but Ms. Singer's transfer leaves open the Fire Marshal spot. We are fortunate to have a young man of great bravery and outstanding integrity to fill the role, as Roy Easley has agreed to accept the job." Everyone applauded as Medal of Valor recipient Easley came up and shook the Sheriff's hand.

"I'll leave these Fire Department and EMS people here to answer your questions." said Griswold. The rest of us followed him inside.

"Soooo..." I said to Teresa as we walked down the hallway toward the Sheriff's Office for a small party with a couple of cakes, "convinced the Admiral, eh?"
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 4|
--------------------------------------------
"Har!" growled the Sheriff happily, his mustaches quivering. "Yes, I asked her to come with me to talk to Cordell. She was the one that persuaded him."

"I sure did." said Teresa. "When the Sheriff told me he wanted Dr. Cordell for the job, it was an epiphany, like a light bulb turning on in my head. And he said it himself... he gets to lead the civilian version of Navy Corpsmen again. I suspect we'll have a few Navy Corpsman veterans working for us in a few months."

"Is Roy Easley ready for the Fire Marshal job?" asked Beth Paige. I couldn't help but grin at that. Teresa saw it and grinned, too. "What?" Beth asked.

Teresa said "I'm reminded of a Medal of Valor recipient who was promoted straight from Lieutenant to Commander without ever being a Police Captain. And was Acting Chief of the whole Police Force for a while."

"That's right." growled Griswold. "With Don Troy as an example to look up to, Easley will be fine. And Zoe has been training him and prepping him for this for some time..."

Meanwhile, Admiral Cordell was answering questions from the Media. "Yes, I've informed President Wellman and the Hospital Staff of my decision. I've enjoyed the opportunity to serve as Hospital Administrator, and I'll still be on Staff as a trauma doctor if they need me, but the EMS is like a calling for me..."

<b>Part 16 - Polling Data</b>

7:30pm, Thursday, September 26th. We had the back room of The Steakhouse to ourselves for the Charter Commission's party. Edna Carter and her husband came, as did Rev. Joseph E. Williams and his wife. Edward Steele came with his wife, Professor Stephanie Steele, and his daughters Selena and Marie. I came with Laura, and we brought Carole since Marie was going to be there. Savannah Fineman was also there, and her 'date' was Sheriff Griswold; we'd invited him because of all the help he gave us in writing the Charter.

"So what is the Hospital going to do, with Dr. Cordell leaving?" Stephanie Steele asked Laura.

"He'll be helping with the transition," Laura said, "but I'm not sure who we're going to get to replace him. I understand him wanting to rebuild the EMS, but it's going to be a big hole to fill at the Hospital."

"I've given a name to Dr. Cordell and President Wellman." I said. "Y'all may remember Donny Tate, who was one of Kendra Luskin's victims?" (<i>Author' note: 'Falsely Accused', Ch. 05.</i>) "He's an accountant, and if I don't miss my guess, I think he just might fit into that job very well."

"It's a 'done deal', then." Laura said.

Stephanie grinned, then said "Don, did you ever hear any more about that serial killer that was using my graphics as his pattern?" (<i>Author's note: 'Four Square', Ch. 03.</i>)

"No, I haven't." I said. "Detective Beale in Atlanta emailed me a few weeks ago, and said they'd had no more serial killings since Cindy and I visited them in Atlanta. And with all the excitement going on around here, that had totally slipped my mind. Why? Anything new on your end?"

"No." said Stephanie. "But my paper that had that pattern is going to be published next week. I hope nothing bad will happen, but you might want to have them watch out."

"I'll send out some emails, and alert Jack Muscone." I said.

As the party was winding down, two six-year-old girls came up to the end of my table, with several drawings they'd made. "Daddy," Carole said, "we have the results of the latest polls!"

Everyone grew quiet and watched as I said "Oh really? What are those results?"

Marie held up her drawing, showing some bar graphs and a pie chart. Carole pointed to it with her drink straw as she announced importantly: "In a poll of local six-year-olds, one hundred percent want longer recess at school, later bedtimes, and <i>no</i> stringbeans at dinner." Everyone chuckled.

"Hmmm." I said. "I wonder what your brother Jim's Stringbean Lobby is going to say about <i>that!</i>"

Carole replied "My polling says that little brothers are annoying." Everyone burst out laughing at that.

"My big sister would agree." I said with a grin. "What else does your poll say?"

"Our polling says that dads who let their daughters stay up late and watch more TV are more popular than dads that don't." Everyone 'ooooh'ed at that.

"I'm all for that." said Selena Steele.

"Don," said Edward Steele, "I think we need to poll those dads and see what they think."

I replied "I think we need a Commission to re-write those rules. Only dads of six-year-olds get to be on it, and they want earlier bedtimes and more chores for those household six-year-olds."

"Uh oh!" said Carole, as she pretended to be on the phone. "There's new data coming in! Daddy, your household ratings have gone down fifty per-cent! You should give your voters more ice cream to make up for it." Everyone was howling with laughter by now.

"The dentist lobby would love that." said Edward quietly. I got the subtle joke... Kelly Carnes's husband, under investigation for financial crimes, was a dentist.

"Carole, I think we better get you home and to bed before any more polls come out that will damage my good reputation with these voters." I said, wondering how my six-year-old was picking all this up so fast...

<b>Part 17 - Epilogue</b>

Monday, September 30th. I was sitting in my office with Cindy after the Angels meeting.

"How was the retreat?" Cindy asked. Laura and I had attended a couples retreat with Dr. P. Harvey Eckhart and other couples at 'The Vision' compound in Coltrane County.

"It was good." I said. "It was really good to get some alone time together. And Dr. Eckhart's processes were really good for all the couples there. Thanks for suggesting it."

"My father didn't charge <i>you</i>, did he?" Cindy said.

"No, as a favor to <i>you</i>." I said a bit wickedly. He wouldn't have charged me as his nephew anyway.

"You know how much he charged those other couples that were there?" Cindy asked. "Ten thousand dollars per couple."

I nodded. "And all of them have gone through his full course of programs, too. That's another ten grand per person. But he does over-deliver. His stuff is really good." Cindy nodded.

"So what did you do over the weekend?" I asked.

"Spent some alone time with Betsy." Cindy said. "Callie flew to California and got back late last night. Her porn business is raking in the cash, and she shot a cameo appearance on 'Days of Promise'. Benny Black flew to the City with her on the flight, and stayed there in the City, but I'm not sure why."

"Hmmmm." I said, making a mental note to check on Melina's whereabouts. "Okay, then. Are we ready for tomorrow?"

"Yes, yes we are." said Cindy. "The bling is in. Is this going to be formal or informal?"

"It won't be a full meal deal like the normal ceremonies." I said. "I <i>did</i> think about making Teresa wait until November 1st..."

"Yes! You should make her wait." Cindy said.

"We-ll, she convinced Dr. Cordell to take the EMS Chief job, so there's that."

"Pul-eeze!" muttered Cindy. "She didn't need to convince him. He would've begged for that job if they'd have wanted him to."

I grinned, then said "Well, we're promoting the Precinct Captains today instead of waiting, so it's only 'meet and right' to promote Teresa, too..."

Tuesday, October 1st. It was little Pete Feeley's fifth birthday, and we'd be attending a birthday party for him late that afternoon. But before we would give him presents, we'd be giving ourselves some presents. New insignia!

Even though I'd not been particularly enthusiastic about it all, I did feel a bit of excitement as I came into Headquarters. More for the actual promotions than the other insignia changes. or so I told myself.

There is a small wardrobe/coat closet/locker that was in the back left corner of my office, between the back wall and the book cabinet to the right of my desk, where the 'I Beat Slender Man' trophy held sway. Inside were my semi-formal jacket and leather 'bomber' jacket that I'd sometimes wear with my duty uniform in cold weather. It was with considerable nostalgia that I began removing the oak leaf clusters from those jackets. In a way, the new stars seemed to take me further away from what I loved to do most: be a Detective in the field, solving crimes.

The excitement was building in MCD, so I went in there and watched Bettina's worthless report with them. All she could talk about was the upcoming Board of Inquiry, and that Finneran had been named to it. But that was later this week...

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

"There's a new constellation of stars in the sky." I said loudly as Sheriff Griswold came into MCD, wearing his brown Sheriff's uniform with four gold stars on the epaulettes of each shoulder and each collar of the khaki shirt beneath his jacket.

"May I?" Griswold said to Cindy, and everyone chuckled as a green crowbar was waved in my very specific direction by Our Sheriff. "And you're about to be the Dog Star in my constellation, Crowbar." he growled.

"The Dog Star: the brightest star in the night sky." I said. "That fits."

"Sheriff," said the heavily pregnant Joanne Warner, "Commander Ross is the Bulldog star. Commander Troy is the Wildcat star." Trying to start trouble, she was. Succeed, she did.

"And compared to the Wildcat star, the Bulldogs star is very dim right now." I said. A green crowbar was again waved in my direction, this time by its owner. Yep, it was college football season.

"And speaking of stars..." said Teresa Croyle as she led Fire Chief Davies, Zoe Singer and Roy Easley into the room. Chief Davies already had his two gold stars on the shoulders and collars of his Fire Department uniform, and Easley had the gold star of the Fire Marshal on his dark navy blue Fire Department jacket... along with the silver-bordered red rectangle that denoted the Medal of Valor, and the purple rectangle that denoted the Purple Order.

"Nice uniform, Chief Singer." I said. Zoe was wearing the new EMS uniform. It was a lighter blue, like Air Force blue, lighter than the deep blue Police uniform and even darker navy blue (almost black) Fire Department uniform. The piping on her sleeves and pants was dark blue, almost black. Zoe was also wearing a rectangle denoting her recently-awarded Distinguished Service Medal. And the star on each of her shoulders was silver; the new EMS was making every effort to distinguish itself from the Fire Department.

"Don't y'all wear stars on your collars?" Fire Marshal Easley asked.

"We can." I replied. "But I'm wearing soft shoulderboards on my shirt under my jacket."

"I'll be wearing either soft shoulderboards or a metal star on my shoulder epaulettes." Cindy said. We both had 'TCPD' pins on our collars.

"Soft shoulderboards for me, toooooo." said Chief Moynahan as he came in.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *

We went to the gymnasium for the 'ceremony'. Connie the Police photographer was there and would be taking pictures for us. She reminded us that we would have to have new official portraits taken, as well, which is one reason why I had more uniform jackets in the wardrobe in my office.

The Sheriff and I fitted the silver two-star insignia onto Chief Moynahan's collars for the ceremony. He was already wearing the stars on his epaulettes: the stars were individual, but a bar on the underside with holes aligned them properly. Stars on the collars, like the Sheriff's, were actually touching and connected, and therefore easier to do, so of course we took the path of least resistance.

The Sheriff and Cindy pinned a silver star on each of my shoulder epaulettes, the star going where my oak leaf cluster had been... towards the shoulder and not in the middle. The Sheriff also affixed my new badge onto my jacket, a clip that fit into a little buttonhole slit. Then the Sheriff and I did the same for Cindy for the stars. Her badge said 'Deputy Chief' and so did not change.

Cindy and I pinned silver oak leaf clusters on Teresa's shoulders as the Chief read her promotion proclamation, and Cindy affixed her new badge to her jacket. The Chief and I pinned the same new rank on Internal Affairs Chief Orosco's shoulders, as well. 

Then came the Precinct Captains Abram and Hewitt, who were promoted to full Captains, leaving behind the gold Captain bars for silver ones. And with that, gold Captain's bars were permanently retired from TCPD uniform wear.

Jerome Davis came up, and I put his new badge on his uniform, which said 'Lieutenant'. He was no longer brevetted, but a full Lieutenant. Then I pinned upon the Senior Detectives their new silver bars with three black squares, the former Supervisor insignia.

Then came a surprise. Sheriff Griswold read a proclamation promoting Julia Rodriguez to Detective Sergeant as Cindy and I pinned her rank on her collars, Sergeant stripes with one rocker beneath, the same as an Army Staff Sergeant. And we did the same for Roy McGhillie, also a promotion to Detective Sergeant.

And then we did what Police Officers do... brought out the doughnuts and consumed them!

6:00am, Wednesday, October 2nd. I was driving through Town as the first light of dawn began illuminating the buildings, the streetlamps still on. I loved driving through my Town at the break of a new day. Truth be told, it was mornings like this that motivated me to accept the task of re-writing the Charter, and of course being a Police Officer here.

I came into Headquarters and went to check on the Duty Desk, per usual. The Duty Desk Patrolman was hanging up the new photos of the command structure on the wall. The Duty Desk Sergeant was briefing me on the duty log entries when the phone rang. I pointed to him to answer it.

He noted the time in the duty log and made notations. Then he hung up and said "Sir, that was the 9-1-1 dispatcher. Someone called in and said there are people at Point Hollow... dead people, sir..."
