Author's Note: This is my first story. I welcome all constructive criticism. This is entirely a work of fiction. Note up front, one of the main characters here is cheating on her boyfriend. If that's not your cup of tea, you've been forewarned. There is plenty of other amazing content here. This is a bit of a slow build up, but I intend it to build into a much longer work. Chapters will appear regularly as time allows.

* * *

"I'm Kat Freely of KBRK Houston. Tune in tomorrow morning for the latest on two new major road construction projects. And I'll always keep you up to date with road conditions on the early shift at 6 a.m." At 33, there already was a hint of crow's feet at the corner of her eyes, thanks to years of the required, overly eager local news smile. But the mat red lipstick, tasteful makeup, and freshly colored dirty blonde hair gave her petite figure an appealing girl-next-door quality. She wasn't a bombshell like Rita Johnson, the meteorologist at KLLL, but Kat's blue dress pinched at her high waist to reveal a subtle flair at her hips, toned legs in nude heels, and noticeably pert breasts.

"I love the way that dress looks on you," I told her, the TV visible to us both.

"I think you love the way it looks right there," she said, glancing back at me before turning her eyes on the crumpled blue fabric on the floor, hastily discarded only a few minutes ago.

"I do prefer it there," I said, giving a firm smack to her ass just as I pulled my cock almost fully from inside her. I admired the thick, glistening coat on it from her arousal before sliding it back in confidently, relishing her satisfied moan as my tip touched the edge of her cervix.

"Just fuck me," Kat said. "I've been needing this."

"You always need it, you fucking slut," I said, speeding up my thrusts.

"Especially today," she said. "It's date night."

I slammed my cock into her and held it inside her. She turned her head toward me again and bit her lip, the sign that she was feeling especially naughty. My eyes lit up.

"Where is he taking you?" I asked.

"That new sushi place everyone's talking about," she said. See-and-be-seen was part of the job.

"What are you thinking?"

Kat expertly slid off my cock, turned around, and put her lips close to mine. Her hand gripped my hardness, the delicate fingers barely fitting around it. "Well I did just get waxed," she said.

I took the hint and smiled. We had played this game before. "A nice thick load in your panties so you can feel me against your lips all night?" I said, cocking my head.

She answered with an urgent kiss, and I couldn't believe my good fortune that we had found each other. It happened by chance. A local celebrity with such a pristine reputation had turned out to be my soulmate in smut.

* * *

I knew who Kat Freely was. I followed her on social media. We were Facebook friends, thanks to numerous mutual friends who trafficked in the Houston food scene. We had even conversed in direct messages a few times about travel destinations. But it wasn't until a charity fundraiser that we met in person. I admit, I sought her out. I wanted to meet her. She was cute. She liked food. What wasn't to like? I didn't try to make it too obvious that I tracked her movements around the ballroom, as guests went from table to table tasting dishes from local restaurants that were paired with wines. It wasn't hard to make it happen. It was over a forgettable short rib served with an even more forgettable Napa Cabernet. The poor showing left the table overlooked most of the night, and we were the only two standing there. I caught the frown on her face after she took a small, exploratory bite of the undercooked short rib and took that as a cue to move next to her.

"It needed to braise a little bit more, didn't it?" I whispered, hoping I hadn't put my face too close to hers.

"Until tomorrow to get tender, it seems," she said and looked up at me.

"I'll tell you what," I said. "Put yours on my plate, and I'll make it disappear. No one will be the wiser."

She smiled. "And they say chivalry is dead."

"I'm John," I said, putting down the plate and extending my hand. She put hers down next to it, slid the short rib off her plate and onto mine, and extended her hand. "Kat Freely," she said. "The traffic girl."

"I confess," I said. "I recognized you."

"And you still saved me from that short rib," she said. "Thanks."

She started to move to the next table. I went the opposite direction. "It was nice to meet you," I called.

I felt slightly exhilarated by it. She had warm hands. Her style and appeal in person were unmistakable. I sensed a smoldering allure about her. But it was a fleeting meeting, until chance intervened.

A few weeks after our first meeting, we saw each other again. I was attending a lunch time charity gala, where my bank had about a table. Kat was the emcee of the event. I played it similarly to the walkaround tasting. After the program, as people mingled during lunch, I tracked her movements and found a suitable natural moment to go up and say hi.

"Hi, Kat," I said, "we met a couple weeks ago..."

"At the foundation event. Yes! You saved me from the short rib," she said. I gave a broad smile.

"I'm flattered that you remember," I said. "But I just wanted to say what a nice job you did today."

"Thank you," she said, and then was pulled away to others waiting to speak with her.

I got hung up at the event longer than I wanted. A talkative client had cornered me, so I ended up at the valet stand after it mostly had cleared up. But there stood Kat, speaking with someone from the valet staff. She looked concerned.

"Fancy meeting you here," I said as I approached.

She turned around. "I'm starting to think you only show up when I need help," she said.

"Oh?" I said. "What's the matter?"

"My car has a flat tire," she said. "I need to get it towed. Run flats. I thought they'd be a good idea. Once the wrecker gets here, I can call an Uber."

"I am bad luck, aren't I?" I said. "The short rib. A flat. I'm starting to think I need to make it up to you. Why don't I give you a ride?"

"Chivalry really isn't dead with you," she said. "But I don't want to inconvenience you."

I laughed. "I just got stuck with a client trying to suffocate me. I'd welcome the break."

So I gave her a ride home. It wasn't far to her apartment, only fifteen minutes, but I got to have a real conversation with her. She was born and raised in Houston. A University of Houston graduate. She had worked for three of the local TV stations now, and she loved it, but her real passion was food and cooking. I glossed over my boring career as an investment banker and talked about my love of food and cooking, too. I hoped the ride went as quickly for her as it had for me. And the bonus? Her complex was across the street from mine near downtown and also a short commute to her TV station. Smart and convenient.

When I pulled up to her apartment building, I said, "Guess it's too early to hope for a drink invite." And laughed probably too eagerly.

"Maybe not too early," she said, "but I'm not sure what my boyfriend would say."

Ouch. And that was that, I thought to myself. But the Fates weren't having it. A month later, a restaurant owner friend of mine had a guest chef from San Francisco in for a one-night collaboration. It was a big foodie event, and he invited me, as he always did. I suspected maybe destiny was on my side when I arrived and, during the cocktail reception, noticed Kat. She wore a tasteful A-line red dress that suited her admirably. I looked for an excuse to go talk to her, but I had arrived late and didn't get a chance. But I confirmed destiny's hand when I sat down at my assigned seat. Next to me was Kat Freely. When she joined the table, I leaned toward her ear and said, "We have to stop meeting like this."

She laughed and made eye contact but didn't say anything. So I picked up the conversation. "I've been really looking forward to this," I said. "Have you been to the chef's restaurant in San Francisco?"

"I haven't," she said. "But I'm supposed to have a weekend out there soon, and it was on my list."

"Well, if you need any recommendations, let me know. I go there a lot for work."

We made small talk as the meal began. The food was superb, better than what I'd come to expect in Houston, which is still pretty damn good. I leaned toward Kat again and said, "It's a shame your boyfriend is missing this."

"He's traveling for work," she said. "He does a lot." There was just enough hint of acidity in her words to make me take note.

The dinner grew more raucous as the wine flowed, and it was a delightful evening all around. As the party broke up, I asked Kat if she needed a ride. She said she had taken Uber. What a coincidence, I noted, so had I. I offered to share one with her. Then the wine got the better of me. "Or, you know," I said, "you could finally ask me up for that drink."

Her hazel eyes looked back at me, piercing. "I can't leave here in an Uber with someone." She paused and lowered her voice to barely audible. She surprised me and put her hand on my thigh under the table. "Do you remember where it is? Wait until I'm gone for ten minutes. Then come to my place. Apartment 2248. The access gate along the alley is broken. You won't need a card. Don't knock loudly."

I could only nod in response. She made the rounds for another thirty minutes saying her goodbyes, and I spent the time trying to calm my hands and lower my heart rate. Was this happening?

The Uber ride was interminable. It was after 10:30 p.m. when I approached the door and gave a faint tap on its metal exterior. It swung open immediately, but Kat wasn't there. I stepped inside, and she closed it; she had been standing behind it. She still wore the red dress and had a glass of Champagne in her hand.

"Sorry for the cloak and dagger," she said, "but I have a feeling you get it." I nodded.

"Even if it takes cloak and dagger, I'm not going to pass up the chance," I said.

She laughed. "And what chance is that?"

I smiled. "To have a drink."

The conversation was effortless. We had common taste, and the Champagne helped things along. Next thing I knew, it was nearly midnight. "Don't you have to get some rest before the morning shift?" I asked.

She looked at her watch, a stylish Chanel. "Look at the time," she said. "But I don't like to miss an opportunity. They don't come along very often."

"What do you mean by that?" I asked. "It seems like you are pretty active on the social scene."

"Listen, John," her eyes locked onto mine, a slightly glassy urgency in them, "you're not missing the chemistry I'm feeling here, are you?" I shook my head and grinned too eagerly. "You probably have this idea of the 'traffic girl' and, whether consciously or not, a lot of presuppositions about who I am. But I'm also a paradox. I have a side to me that..." she trailed off and paused, "... that I haven't fully let free for a few years. Not for a lack of desire. Oh, no, most definitely not because of that. Because I can only share it with the very rare person who gets it but also who will appreciate and honor my need for total secrecy."

"My interest is piqued," I said. "And you think I'm one of these rare people? We barely know each other."

"True," she conceded, "but we have mutual friends. I've asked around a little bit. Very quietly, of course."

I laughed. "That's either good or bad, but I am here, and we are having this conversation, so I'm guessing that the blemishes on my reputation might have something to do with the mirror image of your public persona."

It was her turn to grin. "Now you're getting it," she said. "John Cameron... smart, charming, genuine, big-hearted..." she paused again, crossed her legs toward me and leaned closer on her couch. "Wild. Insatiable. Loves fine indulgences. Especially women."

"That's not particularly uncommon for someone like me. Banker, lover of good food, fan of travel," I said.

"It is getting late," Kat said, "so let me just be blunt. You see the picture I'm painting, I think. Go home. Sleep on it. Think about it for a day or two. I think you and I could have some fun. But you have to accept my term of total secrecy. You'll come to understand why."

"I understand," I said. "And I don't need to think about it." The possibility was simply too delicious. I had always had a weakness for other men's women. It was my private but favorite indulgence. A luxury like great caviar and Champagne.

"That's flattering," she said.

"As long as you understand I've also got a certain reputation to uphold," I said.

She nodded. "Mutual respect. Mutual discretion. If you stand by your decision, come back here Friday morning. It has to be early. At 3:30 a.m. Don't knock. I'll open the door once. Exactly at 3:30. If you're not here, I'll know you changed your mind."

I smiled. There was no chance of that.

Author's Note: This is an interrelated series, so I recommend reading Chapter 1 first. But you can probably get some pleasure going forward just reading this. It's going to get pretty slutty from here on out.

* * *

The two nights between Wednesday and Friday passed in a blur. Work had been busy, but it was always busy. I had been working on a couple deals in Europe, which made Kat's 3:30 a.m. schedule easier to accommodate, since there were a lot of early morning calls. I thought a lot about what seemed like it should be a great stroke of luck. Here was the cute local traffic girl, with her pristine image, implying there was a deep, very dark side to her. And she lived a short walk away. The boyfriend aspect didn't bother me. Maybe I was blinded by desire, thinking with my little head. It never worked out that a vague social media infatuation turned into something tangible. The situation with Kat felt different, though.

I contemplated this as I crossed Allen Parkway to Buffalo Bayou Park, wearing jogging clothes. I walked over the pedestrian bridge above Memorial Drive and through the broken gate I had used two nights earlier. This was an unusual tryst--if that's what it would become--to say the least. The unique circumstances sent up my heart rate, and my palms felt damp. I rode the elevator to the twenty-second floor and got out. As I approached apartment 2248, I checked my watch. It was 3:28 a.m.

Halfway down the hall, I stood in front of her door. 3:29 a.m. I took a deep breath and stood firmly, arms at my sides. The door opened. Like the first time, Kat wasn't standing in the doorway. I walked in. She closed the door and smiled at me. "I was looking through the peephole," she said. She wore a shimmering white silk robe that ended mid-thigh and had a neckline that plunged between her breasts. Her hair looked like it was ready for the bright lights of TV. I must have looked dumbstruck.

"We've got thirty minutes," she said. "No bruises. No hickeys. Nothing that might last longer than a day. Hand prints on my ass are just fine." She grinned, then added, "And don't you dare fuck up my hair too badly. I'm on air in an hour-and-a-half."

The first kiss came hot and fast. She dove into me, though she was about a foot shorter than my six-foot-two frame. There was urgency to her lips and tongue. Her hands eagerly went for the front of my gym shorts as mine cupped her ass, which I discovered was a pleasing, firm bubble. Quickly, she got on her knees and pulled down my shorts. "This looks absolutely delicious," Kat said and flicked out her tongue to give the head a lick. She licked the length of it and cupped my balls in her hand. I moaned and sighed, the delicious wet warmth of her mouth impairing my ability to speak. She took my cock in her mouth and let it harden there, then pulled off.

"I fucking love feeling a dick get hard in my mouth," she said. I could only manage a nod.

She sucked me for a few moments more, bringing me to full erection, then got up and gave me eager kisses again while stroking my shaft. "Bedroom," she panted. "We don't have much time."

I followed her. The bedroom's generous view of downtown Houston was breathtaking. The king-sized bed was inviting. She untied her robe and let it drop to the floor. I smiled broadly. This was going to be fun. It was a cheerleader's body. Kat Freely obviously took pride in her appearance. Her legs were taut. Breasts pert and capped by pink nipples that jutted out fiercely. Her thighs showed off her Pilates habit. And that bubble butt. It was as inviting as the beautiful, smooth mound between her legs.

Kat climbed into the bed, and I broke free of my inability to speak. "I have condoms," I said. She shook her head and motioned to me to join her. I kneeled beside the bed, wanting to drink in her entire body. I put my face between her thighs and savored the musky, slightly soapy aroma. She had prepared for me. Her pussy glistened with juice. I took a long lick, from her asshole to the top of her clit. She shuddered. I licked again. She ran her hands through my hair, then pushed my head back.

"We don't have enough time," she said. "Fuck me. Like a whore."

I took the message to heart, not wanting to disappoint. I maneuvered her into doggy style and ran a finger languorously along her soaking slit. Jesus, this was going to be delicious, I thought to myself. I ran my cock head up and down, coating it with her juices. She gasped. Then I inserted the tip. Kat's velvety walls invited more. I sunk myself in fully, giving her a moment to adjust as I bottomed out. Then I began thrusting. It was exquisite. Her cunt played catch-and-release with my cock. It was like finding two pieces at the beginning of a 1,000-piece puzzle that fit together perfectly. I moaned and muttered, "Fuck, you feel good."

She fucked back against me. "Spank me," she implored. I obeyed. First lightly, then with increasing vigor. Spanking happened to be a particular favorite of mine, and Kat was up to the task. My pace increased, the thrusts becoming more forceful. I saw the sheen of sweat along the dimples of her lower back. She reached back and squeezed my balls. I felt the eager clenching of her pussy as she begged me not to stop. She knew I wouldn't.

Her moans turned to screams as she reached orgasm. I briefly worried about neighbors hearing us, but it was useless to stop. Kat's body tightened, she pushed and ground her pelvis back into me frantically, then released. Panting, she said, "Don't stop. You have to fill me up. Make me go on TV leaking your cum all morning."

She knew what she was doing. The totality of the situation made me light-headed. I pounded her for a few more minutes then warned her I was going to cum. It was so strong, my orgasm hit the point of pleasure overload that felt like pain. And then my balls released torrents of sperm, cascading inside her. As my thick, hot cum filled her insides, Kat moaned in delight. My cock finished twitching, and I slowly pulled out. Her ass cheeks were pink from my hands. Her pussy still sparkled with nectar. Then a trickle of cum appeared from inside her.

Kat rolled onto her back, and I joined her. We kissed and looked at each other. "That was... wow," I said. "I'm not usually at a loss for words."

"I'm just impressed you showed up in the middle of the night," she said. Her fingernails trailed over my balls, then she dipped a finger inside her pussy and brought it to her lips and tasted. "If you can keep this between us, it's just the tip of the iceberg."

"That's not going to be a problem. At all," I said. I glanced at my watch. It was 3:50 a.m. "I think your hair is in good shape."

She laughed. "Thanks for that," she said. "I should get ready. Watch the traffic on KBRK this morning." As she got up, she grabbed a thong from the dresser next to her bed and put it on.

"I think it's safe to say I'm going to be a loyal viewer," I said.

Author's Note: This is the third in an ongoing series. I highly recommend reading the earlier chapters. This chapter continues a theme with a character who has a boyfriend and is cheating on him. It also introduces drug use, which will be recurring. Please avoid if these offend you. I appreciate constructive criticism and feedback. Thank you for reading!

* * *

I got back to my apartment just after 4 a.m., and I was buzzing like I hadn't in a long time. There was an unexpected yet obvious quality to all of it. In two months, Kat Freely had gone from a fringe social media acquaintance at the periphery of my thoughts to... what? As I showered and tried to focus on the work day ahead, my thoughts kept wandering back to Kat. I worried that perhaps it was a one-time thing, and it surprised me how vehemently I recoiled at the idea. How many one-night stands have there been in the last ten years alone? Dozens. I shook it all off. I had work to focus on. I checked my watch, intent on going into the office early, and saw it was 4:57 a.m. I turned on the TV and tuned it to KBRK. I took my coffee and sat down on the couch, waiting for the first traffic report.

A couple live, local, late-breaking headlines later, on came Kat Feely. She beamed, looking cheerful and collected in a blue dress, her hands animated as she talked about the building rush hour. I felt my cock stir. I knew what was under that dress. I thought of my cum, pooled in the crotch of the black thong she had put on barely an hour ago. Had she really left it on? Was she really so naughty that she went to work wearing cum-filled panties? I loved the idea. I unzipped my dress slacks and fished out my cock. Just hearing her voice, even if it was innocuous traffic information, made me hard. So recently, she had been impaled on my dick, begging me to fill her. Was her ass still pink from the spanking, I wondered? It wasn't long before I shot another load. I zipped up and put my mind's focus back to work, and it hit me. Kat Feely had all the power. I didn't even have her phone number.

* * *

It didn't occur to me until later that, of course, there were messaging functions on Instagram and Facebook. Even then, I didn't have to wait very long. Kat wrote me a DM on Instagram the following Monday. We met for a drink the next day at a popular, trendy happy hour spot. She came with a couple girlfriends. I sat at the bar. She ordered drinks, conveniently standing next to me. The wait for drinks was long. Our chatting wasn't out of place. She sketched out some basic parameters she had been thinking about and asked me to think about them. She said she'd reach out to me again on Instagram with the number from a burner text message app we could use to chat when we wanted.

Her proposal was that we meet once or twice a week. For now, it would be the early mornings, mostly mid-week and always at her place, following the same protocol we had used the first time. We could chat via the text app. She hinted that we had a lot to talk about, and I was eager to do so. Kat's drinks came, and she was gone, back to chatting and laughing with her foodie girlfriends as if nothing were amiss. I finished my drink and left. As I walked out, I noticed her boyfriend had joined them. I smiled to myself. He looked like a goofy motherfucker for sure.

The wait for Kat's message wasn't long. It came while I slept the next morning, as she woke up and got ready for work. She was full of excitement, and it made me feel confident and good. She apologized in advance if she went silent. She said she would delete the app any time she would be with her boyfriend. She asked if I was free the next day for another quickie, then launched into a litany of details and fantasies she wanted to share. I read and reread the long missive. And I started got increasingly excited about the possible debauchery here.

"John -- I can't believe how genuinely I know I can trust and explore with you already. I know it took a bit of a leap of faith on your part to go along with things, but I envision this becoming a regular affair. There are, however, some things you should know about me.

"I have no intention of leaving my boyfriend. We don't need to talk about it. We can if you want. Suffice to say, I have needs. I bury these deep down for various reasons, many of which you probably can guess. Some people scuba dive. Others jump out of airplanes or drive fast. The thrills I crave are different. I love sexual risk. Feeling your cum inside me last week? Was the most exhilarating rush I've had in years. You can't imagine how excited I was, having your cum in my panties. My pussy was throbbing all day wanting more. I haven't indulged this side of me since I joined KBRK. Before then, I mostly reserved the slutty side of me to vacations, which I specifically chose to indulge these urges.

"This won't all be limited to my apartment. We just have to be careful. You'd be surprised at all the things we'll be able to do. Did you know I wear a butt plug to work, on the air, at least once a week? I can spend a whole day in bed playing with my Hitachi wand, but I have craved real encounters but couldn't have them until now. And now I'm afraid I won't be able to stop.

"There is part of me that craves an increasing level of risk and adventure. I've always been this way. Pushing limits. Pushing my vices and experiments. All you need to know, though, is that my body is not a temple. It is an amusement park. And it is yours. -- Kat"

To me, it was a masterful appeal, equal parts flattering and mysterious. The next day couldn't come fast enough. I had to take melatonin to ensure I fell asleep early enough. When my alarm went off at 3 a.m., I showered and put on my jogging clothes. The walk to Kat's apartment was peppered with a hop in my step. She opened the door, hiding behind it as usual, but this time was completely naked. We melted into a kiss before she backed away, letting me admire her. She put two fingers into her pussy and showed off her wet, stringing juices before raising them to my lips and coating them in her arousal. I licked my lips and smiled.

"You taste so sweet," I said.

She smiled and said, "I get so wet thinking about your dick. I need it in me." She bent over the couch in the living room, spreading her cheeks to put her soaking pussy on irresistible display. "Don't be gentle," she said. "And I haven't done my hair yet."

I simply stepped out of my shorts and entered her completely with a single thrust. I began thrusting rapidly, ferociously and crudely took a handful of ass cheek before giving her a firm smack that left a glowing pink hand print. She yelped and urged me, "Harder." I obliged, then let a hand roam, cupping a breast and tweaking her nipple firmly, before moving a hand down her abdomen and rubbing her clit briefly. My hand trailed up her back before I took a firm grip of her dirty blonde hair and yanked her head back, my cock never losing a beat as it pistoned in and out of her pussy. She moaned as I pulled her head to me and sloppily licked and kissed her neck and delicate collarbone.

"Yes! Fuck yes!" she moaned.

I released her hair and moved my hand around her neck and squeezed. She bucked against my thrusts more eagerly. Totally compliant. An absolute fuck doll. Her magic pussy never stopped its soaking, velvety assault on my cock.

"I own you," I growled. "This is my cunt, you slut."

"Yes! Yes, sir!" she exclaimed. Her breath became shallow, and her panting indicated her orgasm building. I fucked her even faster, not relenting for a moment, until I felt her abdominal muscles contract and her pussy spasm. Her moans took off into the stratosphere, and I joined her as a wave of juice gushed from her pussy, flowing down my cock and her thighs.

It was all so hot, I felt the urgency in my balls far too soon. "Jesus, Kat, you're going to make me cum," I shouted.

"Fuck that's so hot," she said, pushing more of her weight into the sofa. "Just fucking fill me."

I closed my eyes and concentrated on the absurd eroticism of the situation. Had it even been ten minutes since I walked in the door? I just let myself go. "Oh, god, here it comes," I said. It was as if I couldn't control it at all. I exploded, and it struck me how hot it was to hear the pure and ecstatic, "Yes, baby!" Kat uttered when the first spurts hit her. I drove my cock in as far as it could, wanting her to feel the warmth spread into her cervix.

We were panting. I grabbed a handful of ass again as she stood up and turned around. Her eyes were on fire with hunger as she moved to kiss me.

"I'm on fire," she said. "You really do own me."

I kissed her back, moving an open hand down between her legs, placing it underneath her pussy. "Squeeze it out," I whispered to her in a firm tone. She obeyed. My palm filled with my creamy spunk and her juices. I lifted it to her mouth and told her to taste me. She lapped it up with quick flicks of her tongue, her eyes locking on mine."

"You're like a Kitty Kat when you're being a slut like this," I said. "The regular Good Kat during the day and my naughty Kitty Kat at night."

She gave a soft moan and showed me the cum before she swallowed. "I like that," she said and paused. "You have no idea how bad I've needed this." She moved to kiss me, then pulled back.

"I don't mind," I said. "Kiss me. You have no idea what a filthy fucker I am."

We embraced and made out like teenagers. I glanced at my watch. Our time was almost up. She knew it, too.

"That was so hot," Kat said.

"I like to be in control," I told her.

"I need to be controlled," she said. "Within reason."

I laughed and changed the subject. "I have no idea how you're going to go straight to work right now. I might need a nap."

She smiled her TV smile and said, "Well, I confess, it might be impossible. But maybe I handle it by being a Kitty Kat more often than you might think."

I raised my eyebrows, trying to figure out what she was hinting at.

She took my hand and led me to the bedroom. "I'll let you in on a really big secret," she said. "No judgment, okay?"

I nodded. "I'm not in a position to judge."

She directed me to her bathroom, where the lights were on and a pink dress hung above nude heels awaiting the work day. She stroked my chest affectionately, and I realized I had left my shirt on. She stood up on her tip-toes and drew my eyes to follow hers. I did, and she said, "Two lines a day keep the cobwebs away." My eyes found the mirror with two neat lines of cocaine cut on it and a sturdy, stainless steel straw next to them indicating this was nothing casual.

Kat looked at me with some nervousness betrayed on her face. She bit her lip and hastily added, "It's all right to be a little bit of a party girl, right?"

I smiled, broadly and genuinely. "I have always loved a party girl," I said, grabbing her chin to pull her in for a kiss.

* * *

I sunk into my couch at home with a double espresso and turned on KBRK. In a few minutes, on came my Kat Freely, as I had begun to think of her, and marveled that only an hour earlier I had seen her expertly snort two lines of blow. Then she sank to her knees and sucked a second load of cum out of me before sending me packing. Her pink dress was flattering. There was not a hint of nasal congestion in her voice. Just the sparkling gleam in her eye and TV-wide grin. She was a fucking pro.

I replayed the morning in my mind. I was particularly keen on the submissive side she showed me. I wanted to own her. I wanted to push her to her limits and beyond. I did love a party girl. Fucking on coke was fun, though an indulgence I permitted myself only a handful of times a year, and this side of Kat reminded me of my last true party girl. Jess. She had been my unicorn for four years until rehab became a necessity, and she got her life together. I wanted to know more about Kat's habit. How long she had kept it hidden. I needed to watch her closely for the signs of over-indulgence. But the prospect of a goody-two-shoes local celebrity being my little coke whore had a gravitational pull.

While Kat delivered her first traffic report of the day, I picked up my phone and texted her. "Is this the day of the week that you have your butt plug in? Or were two loads of cum enough?" I said.

I finished my coffee and showered. As I gathered my briefcase for work, the text app pinged. "There is never enough cum," Kat replied.

"That didn't answer my question," I responded.

"No," she answered immediately, "it's not plug day."

"Prove it," I said. I put away my phone and went to the office. Now we would see if I could start pushing her limits and probe her desire to be controlled.

It was a short drive to my building downtown. I liked my apartment because I could live close and not piss away time on a commute. It also gave me easy access to any of the desirable areas of Houston, which made my busy social life easier. The commute was the biggest thing, though. Regularly working more than 60 hours per week was an annoyance. The money was worth it. A long commute would have chafed at me nonstop.

As I sat down at my desk, brought my monitor to life, and felt relief that my voicemail light was not blinking, my phone pinged again.

"Satisfied?" Kat had responded. Beneath was a picture of her ass, bent over and spread with one hand. The pink dress gave me confidence she had just taken it. I smiled. She made me do that a lot.

"Good girl," I wrote back. "But not satisfied."

I silenced my phone and threw myself into the work day. Before I knew it, even though it was a relatively calm day, the clock read 4 p.m.

Kat had blown up my messages. She had written back right away to mine, "But not satisfied." It was a series of a dozen messages while she was at work that day, getting progressively more enticing as they went unread. Finally, after she had gotten home, she sent a plaintive final note:

"Daddy, please, I need it." It was attached with a picture of her kneeling before the full-length mirror in her bedroom, her ass cheeks spread, and a sparkly pink princess butt plug snugly in her ass.

After that, the game was on in earnest. We had morning trysts four weekdays in a row after that, all of which followed largely the same pattern. Naked greeting. Brief making out before some preliminary head or just headlong into urgent fucking. Our encounters were so short each time, we glossed over the appetizers for the main course every time. Yet it hadn't become boring. There was such intensity and fit to the way our bodies moved together, it was as if we were parsing out the massive energy of an explosion in short, small doses. There was so much more pent up inside.

To be honest, after those first few weeks, it frustrated me. I was getting tired of thirty-minute mornings. I wouldn't have given them up, but I wanted more. And it was a rare feeling.

I had gotten in the habit of staying with her while she dressed for work. I'd make her coffee. She'd snort two lines before she left, or two when I arrived and two before she left if she'd been out later the night before. I loved watching it. It was an odd fetish but an enduring one of mine, going back to my days with Jess. I'd leave her apartment ten minutes before she did.

One morning, about a month after our affair had started, as I gave an approving look at the day's floral-patterned dress, I said, "Kat, I am really digging this... whole thing. But I want more. I want more time. I need it."

She blinked. "Okay."

"Okay?" I asked.

"Okay," she repeated. "All you had to do was ask." Her smile was wry.

I was caught off guard. Kat was savvy. I thought I was playing from the position of power, trying to increase my control over her and push her boundaries. She had me on the string the entire time. I felt like an amateur.

"How about this afternoon? Lunch and play time?" I offered.

She shook her head. "I'm going to a charity lunch at the Marriott Marquis."

If Kat had me off balance before, this set me back in my right frame of mind. "I'll get a room there. A suite overlooking the pool. Come up after lunch. Boyfriend's out of town, right?"

She smiled and nodded eagerly. I emailed my assistant and told her I was taking a mental health day. I booked a suite at the Marriott, then called the front desk to confirm early check-in. I took a nap and showered, before heading to the liquor store to pick up Champagne. It was only 10:30 a.m. by the time I finished. I shouldn't have taken the day off. I went to the gym and did cardio. I went home and showered again. It was 11:45. Close enough. I drove to the Marriott and checked in.

The suite had a great view of the pool. It was a sunny December day in Houston, hardly pool weather. I iced down the Champagne and took the elevator to the ballrooms. I wanted to scope out Kat's lunch. It looked mundane. I paced. I went back to the room and popped a bottle. A couple glasses helped calm me down tremendously. I wasn't sure why I needed to calm down, but I wasn't willing to examine why at the time. I checked work email and flipped channels.

Then the knock came. I opened the door with confidence, and Kat ducked in, stepping quickly like a teenager sneaking out somewhere. I ran my hand under her chin and kissed her, then pulled back to look her in the eyes before kissing again.

"I couldn't eat, I was so excited," she said. I realized eating hadn't even occurred to me. She walked to the suite's dining table, set down her purse, and gathered her hair behind her neck. She came to me and turned and said, "Unzip me." I obliged and admired the fabric of her thong spread as she bent over to take it off.

"Leave the heels on," I said. I pulled her to me again, ass first, and attacked her neck and ear. She pushed me away playfully.

"You don't have anything to do the rest of the day, right?" she said.

"I'm yours."

One side of her smile rose a little higher than the other. I'd learned that was a sign of mischief from Kat. "I want to party," she said. She sat down and fished a baggie of coke from her purse. "And let you use me. I want your cum in all three holes. Think you can handle it?"

I chuckled. "I'm always up for a challenge."

"Good," she said, already chopping up the blow into lines with a practiced hand. "You want some?"

"Fuck yeah," I said. "It's been a while. And don't worry. I don't get coke dick."

"Oh really," she said, never taking her eyes off her task. "I'm going to test you on that. I'm also going to show you a little secret of mine."

"We're getting past the tip of the iceberg?" I asked.

"Definitely, and we are going deep," she said and looked up, four perfect lines on the table and a look of pure lust in her eyes.

"Ladies first," I said.

Kat produced a stainless steel straw from a small makeup bag. It must have been her roadie kit. She rapidly inhaled one line, leaned her head back and sniffed again, then rubbed her nostril from the outside with a finger. She breathed in deeply. "This shit is so fucking pure," she said. "An old coworker can get the best blow. You'd like her."

I smiled. The possibilities already started to swim in my head. This iceberg was going to be full of fun surprises, I guessed.

She leaned back down, repeated the same ritual with the second line, and passed me the straw. It had been a few months. But in my life, coke had been around plenty from time to time, from college on. It was my sophomore year in college at a big state school, when I went to a party with a bunch of the cheerleading team, that I developed the coke fetish. They were all using it, snorting lines, doing bumps, body blows, you name it. It was so erotic. It seemed so freeing. And it was fun from time to time. Almost too fun.

I took both lines quickly. The rush hit fast. It was good shit. Kat's eyes were already slightly glassy, and she nearly attacked me. "I love fucking on coke," she said. "You better watch out."

"You weren't lying," I said between kisses. "This is good shit."

She undressed me and said, "One day I might introduce you. That's pretty deep into the iceberg."

We were flying, and it was exquisite being able to take my time. I took off her bra and panties. We were playing, but I turned serious. "I've been wanting to taste you so badly," I said.

In the bedroom, we made out with me on top of her for a while before I kissed my way down her neck, sucked her nipples to attention, and settled between her thighs. Her pussy lips were slick with arousal. I licked my lips.

"You want to know one of my secrets?" I said. "This is my absolute favorite thing in the world. I could eat a pretty pussy for an hour. I have eaten a pretty pussy for an hour. And taking my time eating you is the biggest reason I needed more time with you."

I dove in with one long, slow lick from the bottom of her lips to her clit. I flicked her clit twice, then flattened out my tongue and focused on slow strokes along the length of her pussy, diving in as deep as I could every few moments.

"I love that soft tongue," Kat breathed.

I continued my deliberate tongue work, noticing as she braced herself on her forearms as the pleasure rose in her. She tasted sweet, fresh, and clean. Her pussy had compact lips and was softly pink inside. Tight but not too small. I lightly inserted a finger, probing for hidden pleasure spots. She gasped when I pushed in all the way, then up toward her stomach. That was it. I focused on her clit now, using a firmer tongue, and explored the area at the back and top of her pussy. All I cared about was making her cum. Her breathing turned ragged, and I could feel her cresting as my pace increased. As her hips bucked into my face, I heard her erupt in honest moans and her pussy became even juicier. I refused to stop, redoubling my efforts, especially working my finger roughly upward inside her, and she came again. She jerked almost into a sit-up as she came, her hips continuing to jerk.

"What... what are you doing to me?" she panted.

She pushed me away from her face. I saw an almost shocked look of pleasure on her face. I moved above her, grinning. Kat was on fire with lust. We kissed.

"I don't know if I've ever cum like that," she said, her eyes not leaving mine.

"It's just the tip of the iceberg," I teased.

I cupped her breasts. They were perfect small handfuls with hard nipples. We laughed at my cheezy response then kept making out. Kat climbed on top of me, and I grabbed her ass. She ground her pelvis against me, and I could feel her pussy's wetness spreading over my groin and thighs. I pulled her chest toward me and sucked her nipple into my mouth, first one and then the other. I ran my hands up her thighs, dipping a finger between them to gather her wetness on a finger, and gently circled her asshole. She didn't clench her cheeks at all.

"Not yet," she said. "Give me a minute."

Kat hopped off the bed and returned a moment later with the cocaine. "I want a line off your cock," she said. "Body blows are so much fun."

I moved to the edge of the bed. She shook her head. "No, stand up," she said. I obeyed. She got on her knees and cupped my balls and jerked by cock to hardness with little effort. I was throbbing and straining. With a small coke spoon I hadn't seen before, she scooped a generous amount onto my erection. It was a thick line. She picked up the straw and looked up at me with puppy dog eyes full of mischief.

"Did you ever dream the traffic girl was going to be your good little coke whore?" she said softly.

I didn't have time to respond before she greedily inhaled the line off my cock, then lasciviously licked the last crystals of coke from my shaft before swallowing my cock in one gulp. Kat sucked cock like a pro. She left strings of spit when she pulled her head off. She jerked my lubed up shaft in unison with her effortless deepthroating. And she almost made my knees buckle when she started sucking my heavy balls. I put my hands behind her head and started moving her head gently. She leaned back on her knees a bit and put her hands down.

"Face fuck me," she begged.

I put a hand behind each of her ears and started rhythmically moving my cock in and out of her mouth. Every few strokes, I'd hold her head deep, making her nose press against my pelvis until she gagged. She was liberal with her spit and sounds, exaggerating the gagging and pushing her head back against my hands to increase the speed.

This continued for a few minutes before Kat pushed back hard enough to pull her mouth off my cock, with a loud slurp.

"You should feel how wet you've made me," she said.

She stood up, and I could see how soaked her lips and inner thighs were.

"You are such a cocksucking slut," I said.

"I am. I love sucking dick so much," she said. "Lie down."

She renewed her blow job with enthusiasm I'd rarely seen. There was an adoration about it. The honest enthusiasm of a true oral sex artist was always something to behold. And Kat was exceptional. It wasn't long before I knew I was about to cum. I warned her. She sped up, moving her head up and down effortlessly. I closed my eyes as things seemed to blur into blackness. She gripped my balls just as the first spurt arrived, clamping her mouth down over my erupting cock. It pumped five, six, seven times, all into her willing and waiting mouth. For a moment, I felt completely spent.

"Jesus," I sighed.

Kat's coke-wild eyes stared back at me. She had held my cum in her mouth and showed it to me like a medal, then swallowed it like a reward. Then she enthusiastically bounced next to me in bed.

"I love cum almost as much as sucking dick," she said. "You have no idea."

My cock was already stirring again. She was insatiable. She was like me. And her kinks were completely in line with mine.

"You are checking some serious boxes for me," I said. "You have no idea. A coke whore. A cumslut. What's next?" I honestly couldn't believe my good fortune. Not since Jess... I stopped the thought in its tracks.

"How about some Champagne?" I suggested. "I'll order room service, too. I don't want to pass the point of being able to function."

She nestled her head into the crook of my neck. "That sounds perfect," she said. "I brought an eight-ball. But I need something in my stomach."

"Oh, that wasn't a big enough load for you?" I teased. I got up to get a bottle of Champagne.

"There is never enough cum," she said seductively. She was in a hyper-sexual zone.

The Champagne opened with that most pleasing "Pop!" I picked up the phone to call room service. "Nachos?" I asked Kat, who still languished nude on the bed. Her nipples poked up prominently. I could see the glisten of moisture on her mound.

"Yes!" she said. "I love junk food when I'm partying."

I ordered and brought her a glass of bubbly. We clinked glasses, drank, and kissed.

"The food will be here in about twenty minutes," I said.

"Just enough recovery time," she said.

I brought us robes, and we drank the Champagne. Kat moved the coke supplies into the bathroom. She really was careful. We chatted and waited for room service.

"How'd you get into the party scene?" I asked.

"I spent a couple years in LA after college, working for a TV station," she said. "My hours were always early morning or late night. I was pretty straight in college, you know, the occasional cigarette and some weed. But in LA it was everywhere, like adderall probably is for a lot of people. My mentor there said it was her secret. I tried it. I loved it. She showed me how to... control it isn't the right description. Manage it, maybe? I don't have a super addictive personality, but what I like? I like."

I told her my college introduction story, and we swapped some more of our adventures. She had more of a wild streak than I would have expected. Her time in LA was full of one-nighters, parties, and even a threesome with a well-known actor and his wife. She told me how her LA mentor had left the business to become a trophy wife to an older, wealthy finance type. They stayed in touch, and she would take a girls' trip to LA to visit her once or twice a year, where they would revisit their younger days, and that largely scratched her wild side itch.

Room service knocked and interrupted story time. Kat stayed in the bathroom, in case the attendant was a fan. When the door closed again, she appeared without her robe on. We ate nude. She sat on my lap at the dining table. The afternoon sunshine filled the room. Her thighs were sticky against mine. We finished the first bottle of Champagne as we swapped stories of our X-rated adventures.

Eventually we paused, and she got that look in her eyes again. "I'm going to show you a secret," she said.

I followed her swaying ass into the bedroom. She disappeared into the bathroom for a couple minutes then returned with a plastic medicine plunger. I looked at her quizzically as I lounged on the bed.

"So Kelly taught me this," she said, referring to her LA television friend. "If you want to get the pick-me-up of blow but not kill your nose? You need to butt bump it." She giggled.

"I feel like I've heard of that," I said, "but I'm not placing it."

"You dissolve a line in a little bit of water," she explained. "And with the high purity stuff I've been getting it is super easy. Put it in this plunger and just, a little bump! Put it up your butt!"

I chuckled. "And how is it?" She wasn't going to get any judgment from me.

She handed me the medicine plunger and leaned into me on the bed. She licked my ear and whispered, "It's the most instantaneous and intense high I've ever had," she said. "It makes me so horny that I almost can't control myself."

Kat straddled my legs on the bed and bent over doggy style, her ass high in the air and face in the sheets.

"Just spread me a little, insert it, and push in the plunger," she instructed. Then she put two fingers to her still-soaking pussy, scooped some juice out, and fingered her asshole. I followed her directions. Seconds after the fluid went inside her, she pushed forward and raised her head, as if she were going into Cobra Pose.

"Holy fuck that's the best," she said aggressively. She clenched her cheeks and held the pose for a few moments. "Oh my god I need that fucking big cock in me. Right fucking now."

She didn't wait for me to oblige. My cock stood stiff from her lascivious display. She climbed on and rode me with reckless abandon. She was flying high and unleashing a torrent of dirty talk at a rapid pace, mixing in details of apparent past flings.
--------------------------------------------
|PAGE 2|
--------------------------------------------
"I haven't had a dick this big in so fucking long," she panted. "I've just been so pent up. Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm going to cum. I'm going to cum. No one's made me cum like this since Jeremy. What are you doing to me? God I'm going to need you in my ass."

I just enjoyed the view and the ride. She erupted, her body going taut and shuddering over and over. But she didn't stop riding. Not until she came three more times. We were drenched in sweat. She breathed heavily but retained the manic look in her eyes and an unnatural energy.

"I want to taste myself," she said as she licked and sucked my cock and balls. "That was so fucking hot. I thought only toys could make me cum like that."

She took a firm grip of my cock and came up to kiss me. "Now we need to give you a turn, mister," she said. "The only question is, where do you want to put it?" She moved close to my face. She nibbled my ear. "You want my ass, don't you?"

I whispered back to her, "Now it's my turn for a secret. I'm an expert at anal. I'm a pro at making women cum with my dick in their ass. It's one of my biggest points of pride."

She smiled and kissed me deeply, pulling back to say, "Well, I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad little anal whore."

Logistically, we couldn't just plunge my cock in her ass. It doesn't work that way. So as hot as the moment was, I had to get up and look for lube. Kat had come prepared. She told me to get the lube from her purse while she fixed us some lines. She brought the coke to the bedside table, and we each snorted a pair.

She grabbed her little spoon again and said, "Put a couple scoops of this on my ass," she said. "Work it into me with the lube. It'll get me going even more, and it numbs me up a touch, so you can be as rough as you want."

I was really curious about how she had discovered all this, but I wasn't about to interrupt the flow. This was the kinkiest and best sex I'd had in years.

Kat positioned herself doggy style on the edge of the bed, and I stood on the floor behind her, next to the night table. I prepped her with the lube and coke.

"Don't worry," I said, "I'll go slow at first." As I pressed the head of my cock against her asshole, I told her to take a deep breath in, then exhale. As she did, I popped past her sphincter and began the slow journey inside her. "Take a minute and get used to it," I told her.

"I feel so full," she said when I bottomed out. "It's so fucking good, John. Your dick is fucking perfect."

She pushed back into me, signaling it was time to start our rhythm. It began moderately and increased in pace. The torrent of dirty talk never stopped from both of us, urged on by stinging smacks of my hand against her ass cheeks. Her ass gripped my cock the full length of every thrust. It was insanely tight, but she took the pounding like a true slut.

"I am gonna cum so hard," she screamed and then exploded like a supernova of pleasure. She'd never been so loud. Her ass clamped down like a vise, making it impossible to keep thrusting. I was buried balls deep in her ass and pushed forward, mashing her face into the pillows. When her body relaxed, I assumed I had fucked all the energy out of her. But she rose up again and looked back at me, a light sheen of sweat on her face. "Holy shit," she said and grinned. "Now give me that fucking cum. I need that load in my ass. Give it to me. Show me what a good Kitty Kat I am for you, daddy."

I could feel my release wouldn't be long, especially not with Kat's deluge of filthy words urging me on.

"Fill my ass up with your load," she begged. "I want it so deep in me that I can feel it leaking out all day. Make me your naughty little anal slut."

I was so close. Looking at how my thick cock stretched her smooth, lightly pink asshole was almost enough to get me there. And then she spewed, "You're the only one who deserves this ass. My boyfriend shouldn't ever be allowed to have it. Give me that cum and show me you want to own this tight little ass."

That did it. I always loved the intimate possession of another man's woman, and here she was begging for it. My cock pulsed repeatedly. I don't know how I could have so much sperm left. But Kat's enthusiasm surely helped. "Oh god, I can feel it," she moaned. "Fucking flood me. Yes. Yes, own it. This is your ass."

We fell next to each other on the bed, and I expected we would take a break, but Kat was still in the thralls of a major coke high. She looked a bit worn but she remained hyper. "We should shower," she suggested.

"I may need a bump to keep up with you," I said.

"Or you could let me put a little in your butt," she said with a smile. "You'll be ready for another round in no time."

"I am definitely open to that," I said. "Maybe later."

She laughed and bounced out of bed to turn on the shower. I took a couple quick sniffs of coke off the small spoon. It really was good shit, and I knew I'd be paying for it later. I took a deep breath. This was the best stolen afternoon I'd had in recent memory. I looked at the clock. It wasn't even 5 p.m. I brushed off the fleeting thought of how many emails must be backed up at work. Fuck it.

The coke, steamy shower, and Kat's soap-slippery body reinvigorated me. We washed each other between frequent kisses. She scrubbed my cock.

"I have a lot of secrets," she said, "but doing ass-to-mouth is definitely not one." I laughed.

As afternoon turned to evening, with the sun setting early, we became more romantic. We cuddled and kissed and had normal conversations about food, work, normal relationship things. It felt natural. Almost to the point of putting me off-guard. We drank a second bottle of wine and refreshed our coke high to stave off the crash. We had fucked two more times, and finally did the last of the eight ball. It was getting late, and we were sliding into the comedown. I climbed on top of Kat one more time, slowly fucking her in missionary as we made out. There was no chance either of us could cum again. It was about the intimacy.

Somewhere in the midst of my long strokes in and out of her, I wondered to myself, "Where is this going?" And then, like a switch, my memory went blank. We had fallen asleep.

--------------------------------------------
Kat and I had reached a dangerous turning point in our affair. Practical realities for both of us precluded debauched days like the one at the Marriott Marquis very often. Her work schedule was demanding, and she had a boyfriend to navigate. We started to broach the topic of how we could go places together without compromising her reputation. My work wouldn't tolerate slacking off, and the frequency of my 3 a.m. wake-up calls would take a toll. By nature, I was more of a night owl than a morning person. I'd rather stay out until 5 a.m., which I frequently did on my regular trips to Vegas, then wake up with the sunrise.

While we worked on navigating those logistical barriers, we started to play games. Mostly over text. And that's when I began to realize the depth of potential we had, from a purely sexual adventure standpoint. What became clear was that we both liked to escalate, to increase the risk level. Kat hadn't been lying in that initial message to me where she proposed our affair. The risk amplified the fun. To make a game of it enhanced it.

It started in fairly cliche fashion. I told Kat that she had to send a picture proving the day each week she wore her butt plug to work. As a reward, I bought her a set of princess plugs with jewels to match her favorite work dresses--red, blue, and pink. I loved secretly knowing that the traffic girl was plugged on the air. But I wanted more.

"I've got a new task for you today," I said one morning during a tryst, as I began to assert my control over her. She was in the middle of sucking my cock and pulled off with that excited mischief in her eyes.

"Yes, sir?" she said. It wasn't a serious tone of submission. It was always playful.

"I'm going to cum in your ass," I said, matter-of-factly, "And then plug you. So you'll be plugged with an ass full of my sperm."

Kat's body shimmied a little. She stood up and kissed me. "That is so naughty," she said huskily. "I love it. And does Kitty Kat get a reward if she obeys you, daddy?"

"I'm not done," I said. She raised her eyebrows. "You have to find a way to mention the word 'plug' on the air."

She laughed. "Oh my god," she said. "That is hot. I'll do it."

"I'll be watching," I said.

Our frequency of anal sex had increased greatly after the Marriott Marquis day. Kat was an adept and eager student of it. We quickly had passed the point of needing lube, which opened up many delicious possibilities. And the butt fuck on this morning was quick and urgent. We were both turned on by my debauched proposal.

I watched Kat's broadcast, and she handled it masterfully. I couldn't stop grinning when KBRK cut to her report midway through the 6 a.m. hour, and she opened with, "Thanks, Steve, we are watching two accidents on the inbound I-10, which has it seriously plugged as a result."

Maybe it was adolescent, but I adored our dirty little secret. And Kat must have, too, because she texted me right after. "How did I do?" she asked.

"Perfect, baby," I said. "I'm working on your reward right now. It's going to be a grand gesture. Watch out. And be prepared!"

"What is it?" she inquired.

"That would ruin the surprise. But let's just say it will feed your wild side like a 20-course tasting menu."

***

I began planning in earnest. It was early February, four months into our relationship, and we had only had the one day away. Kat had mentioned that her boyfriend took an annual boys' trip that coincided with the first weekend of the NCAA men's basketball tournament. This year, that weekend overlapped with St. Patrick's day, and he and his buddies had chosen New Orleans for their Thursday-Sunday destination. This detailed knowledge led me to really appreciate that Kat and I had begun talking a great deal about her significant other.

From the outside, and even to me, it might have seemed bizarre to learn so much about her relationship with her boyfriend. Why not just break up, and we could be together? I knew that wouldn't really work. I wasn't the kind of guy the traffic girl needed on her arm. The boyfriend was. Wealthy family. Worked at a small investment fund. Fourth-generation Texan. Made all the command performances. Let Kat be the star. And maybe that was the most important thing. Don't get me wrong. I wasn't bitter. Or jealous. I had exactly what I wanted. I liked knowing about their relationship because it gave me the knowledge I needed to make my affair with Kat even hotter. It allowed me to set up scenarios where we could push the boundaries further and further. For a time, at least. Until things would get ... I wasn't prepared to think about it quite yet. I was having too much fun.

If the boyfriend was gone for four days, I could safely get Kat out of town for two. My last trip to Vegas had been just before Kat and I started fucking. It had been a memorable weekend with a showgirl acquaintance who didn't mind being spoiled when I came to town. I knew Kat loved Vegas, too. She had told me about weekend trips she took when she lived in LA. She and Kelly would make a game of getting invited to pool club cabanas and see how much of a tab they could run up before undertaking the inevitable quid pro quo of fucking their hosts.

I booked a Thursday night flight that would have us into Vegas by 9 p.m., time enough for a late dinner. Or room service. I called my host at the Wynn and set up a Parlor Suite for two nights. I made dinner reservations at Wing Lei and Joel Robuchon. Then I texted Kat.

"For your reward, I need you to take the day off on March 16," I instructed.

"Weekend getaway?" she responded, with a fingers crossed emoji.

"Boyfriend in NOLA, yes?"

"For four days," she said.

"I'll tell you the details next time I see you," I said. I wanted to see her reaction in person. I suppose I liked to see the reactions in real time to a grand gesture.

"Come over tomorrow?" she said.

***

I obliged. Besides, no matter how difficult it could be to wake up at 3 a.m., Kat's customary naked greeting was addictive. She opened the door and rushed to me, hand instinctively beginning to rub my cock as she kissed me hello.

"Okay, I have been climbing the walls," she said. "You have got to tell me!"

"What have you figured out so far?" I asked.

"St. Patrick's Day weekend," she said, ticking off the first item on one finger. "My man in NOLA for four nights. I figure that gives us two nights somewhere, which means we probably can't go too far."

I smiled. "I love how fucking smart you are," I said. I paused, trying to draw out the moment, but I couldn't. My excitement was too great. "Vegas. Two nights. Get in Thursday night. Fly out Saturday night late."

Kat squealed in delight. "Oh my god!" she exclaimed. "Are you joking?"

"Nope," I said. "And dinner at Joel Robuchon."

Her eyes opened wide. "No way," she said. "At MGM?"

I nodded. She kissed me. "I'm so wet just thinking about it," she said.

"I haven't even told you the sexy plans yet!" I said.

"They can wait," she said. "I need you inside me."

We fucked raw and hard. I didn't take long to cum and filled her with a huge load that was gushing out of her smooth pussy lips as it overflowed. A wave came over me. I felt especially dirty. I moved between Kat's thighs.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

My tongue answered for me, as I licked her cum-covered cunt.

"Holy fuck, you are such a dirty boy," she said. "You filthy fucker, you're going to make me cum."

That wasn't my goal, but Kat erupted before I gathered up as much sperm as I could. I licked her clit for the few moments she needed to cum again. This was fucking filthy. I climbed up her torso and positioned my mouth over hers. She understood perfectly and opened her mouth. I pushed the cum into her mouth, and she swallowed with satisfaction.

"I am a filthy fucker," I said. "I warned you about that. I'm your filthy fucker."

"That was fucking hot!" Kat said. "I'm going to be craving you all day thinking about it."

As she got dressed, we talked about Vegas. "It was really smart of you to book the flight back for Saturday. That's when he'll be blackout drunk. He won't suspect anything," she said.

"I would say I don't care if he does," I said, "but I do care. A lot. I'm not going to jeopardize this."

We kissed again, then she asked softly, "Can we get goodies in Vegas?"

I smiled. "I have an impeccable source."

"You have everything figured out," she said, as she moved to snort her morning lines. She paused. "This trip is going to be really memorable, isn't it?"

"I'm pulling out all the stops," I said.

"Do I even want to know?" she asked.

I laughed and said, "Not if you want to ruin the surprise!"

* * *

The five weeks leading up to my Vegas getaway with Kat seemed interminable, despite our best efforts to ramp up our fun at home in Houston. We both felt silly that it had taken so long to come up with the idea, but she started coming to my apartment for lunch once a week, after she was done with work for the day. I'd cook something for her, and we'd have a quickie. If I was running behind, she would pick up something or cook and let herself in with the key I'd given her.

Once, two weeks before our trip, I was having a particularly stressful day at work. I needed my lunch time escape with Kat, but I didn't have much time. Having a five-minute commute to the office had its benefits, and on that day I wanted to take advantage of it. She texted me to ask if we were still on for lunch. I said the day was not going as planned but that I needed to see her.

Kat must have been nervous at my response because she did something that was very rare. She called.

"Hey," I said, answering on the app.

"Is everything okay?" she asked.

"Just this deal I'm working on," I said. "It'll be fine, but you know how it is. People have to inject a bunch of drama into it." I spoke in a softer-than-usual voice and got up to close the door to my office.

"You had me worried for a second," she said. "It was just an intuition."

"Nothing to be worried about, Kitty Kat," I said. "But I need something."

"Anything."

"I'll be at my place in ten minutes. You need to be naked on the bed, on your hands and knees. No talking. Nothing. I won't have much time."

"Yes, sir," she said, more solemnly than usual.

I hung up and smiled broadly. I bounced out of the office and drove home too fast. I flung open the door to my apartment, which didn't have as good a view of downtown as Kat's, and walked into the bedroom, taking off my suit jacket and already unbuckling my belt.

And there she was. My obedient Kat, naked, doggy style, and pink plug sparkling in her ass. She glanced over her shoulder, licked her lips, and smiled but didn't speak. I didn't take my clothes off. I just dropped my pants and eased her butt plug out. I admired the slight gape it left before replacing it with my throbbing cock.

I knew her body so well now. I simply worked my cock into her ass until she was full. She moaned and said, almost imperceptibly, "Use me, daddy."

I did. This wasn't about mutual pleasure. This was about my need to reduce stress and make her feel my power, my control. My spanks were vicious from the start, leaving behind distinct, crimson hand prints. She yelped, but seeing the juice saturate her pussy and make her inner thighs sticky confirmed I wasn't pushing her too far. I pulled her hair with seemingly uncaring tugs. It wasn't even five minutes before my balls clenched. Her pleasure wasn't my concern today. I unloaded my sperm into her bowels, grunting savagely at the surprising power of my orgasm.

I pulled out and raised my pants enough to walk to the bathroom to clean up. It was a power play, for sure. I had left her ass messy and abused. I didn't feel guilty but thought I should give an explanation.

My cleanup was quick, and Kat lay on her side when I was zipping my pants and rebuckling my belt. She smiled inquisitively.

"I needed a cum dumpster today," I said sheepishly, if I had been capable of the tone.

Her smile remained. "I'm always your cum dumpster. And sometimes? I need to be used." She rolled over again and showed me that she had inserted the butt plug again. I kissed her.

"I may need to play with myself all afternoon, though," she said. "You sure do know how to get a girl all worked up."

I had started my exit to return to the office but paused. "No," I said, turning around. My tone turned stern. "You are not to cum the rest of today. You are not allowed to cum until the next time you see me. Understood?"

Kat looked hurt at first, but I saw the realization wash over her face. A new game. A new challenge. The smile betrayed it. "Yes, daddy," she said. "Maybe tomorrow?"

I shook my head. "Sorry, early calls with Europe tomorrow," I said. "Thursday. Lunch time. Here." And off I went, without looking back.

* * *

The 48 hours between our one-sided ass fuck and our next meeting were excruciating, but I didn't betray that to Kat. I acted aloof. My messages to her were short. I was busy. I was an important investment banker. I was working on a big deal. She needed to understand I set the rules.

Kat played along with a perfect poker face, of course. She always responded when I asked if she had fallen to the temptation to make herself cum. "I would never disobey you," she said.

"Has he fucked you?" I asked.

"Of course," she said, "but you know that doesn't make me cum."

Kat swung it all back to me like a boomerang. There was no gaining an upper hand with her. She was too compliant and too savvy. It made for a very high-strung, exceptional balance of power. It was relentlessly exciting in fresh ways.

When Thursday lunch arrived, I was waiting for her at my apartment. She texted as she left work. I was ready.

She knocked. I answered the door and said, "Key not working?"

"Oh, I forgot I had it," she said breezily. And then she saw the dining room table. White table cloth. Steam rising from two large, shallow pasta bowls. Candles lit. She turned to me.

"Black truffle risotto," I said. "The season is in full swing. I got them in from New York."

She kissed me, and in a flash, everything was back to normal. That chapter of the power game evaporated, and it was just us. I shaved truffle over her risotto, then mine. I adored the way she leaned over the bowl to inhale the aroma. She took a spoonful and blew on it before taking a bite.

"John," she said, "this is absolutely amazing. The texture is perfect."

"Thank you," I said.

It dawned on me that maybe the stress of my deal and our mutual anxiety of the wait for Vegas had given us each a little bit of nerves we weren't used to.

After lunch, our sex couldn't be described as anything other than lovemaking. It was unusual for us but incredibly sensual. We kissed deeply. We took turns being on top and moved at a luxurious pace, savoring the magical way our bodies fit together. We moaned and made sounds of approval, but the dirty talk was almost non-existent. Kat came once, then a second time. Her pussy only got wetter and wetter.

"It's your turn," she said gently, as I reentered her in missionary. "I need it."

I fucked her with long, slow strokes. We broke eye contact only to kiss. They were urgent, deep kisses, filled with emotion.

"I'm close," I whispered. She instinctively began to stroke the underside of my balls, heightening my pleasure tremendously. As my cum emptied inside her, I ground deeply into her. She put her arms around me and pulled me close, and our chests breathed heavily in unison.

"That," she said directly in my ear, "is my absolute favorite feeling in the whole world."

I called my secretary and said I'd be taking a longer lunch. I needed a little break. Kat and I took a nap. Emotions were running high. Vegas could not come soon enough.

* * *

The interminable wait was over. Kat and I were Vegas-bound. That Thursday evening, her boyfriend had left for drinks, dinner, and more drinks in New Orleans, so Kat had done her goodnight call just before I arrived for a quickie while we waited for the Uber.

"I want you to feel the cum flowing out of you the whole flight," I had told her as I bent her over the kitchen counter, shoved aside her thong, and thrust inside. I finished fast, but we still kept the driver waiting a few minutes. We looked guilty as he loaded up our bags and took us to IAH.

We were handsy in the car. I dressed up a bit to travel. Jeans, a button down, and a blazer. Kat wore a surprisingly lightweight dress, but temperatures in both Houston and Vegas were warm. We also wanted to see if we could play on the airplane. Kat nestled up to me.

"I want to hear more of your wild Vegas shit," she said. It wasn't accusatory. Just her normal tone. She wanted storytime.

"You sure you want to know?" I asked.

"Of course," she said.

"I'm not even sure where to begin!" I said.

"Tell me about your last trip," she said. "Right before I made you an honest man."

I laughed heartily. "Well, okay," I said. "So I have a friend out there, a showgirl who's in Jubilee! at the Flamingo." Kat's ears perked up.

"We have lunch or dinner and hang out. This last time, she brought a showgirl friend of hers along. We had drinks. Dinner. Played some craps."

Kat moved closer to me. "This is boring," she said.

"Okay, juicy bits only," I said. "After dinner we ended up in my suite. They danced for me--not the showgirl kind--and I had a spanking contest. Whoever took my spanking the best, got fucked."

"That's devilish," she said. "So who won?"

"Well, her friend won the spanking contest, but they both got fucked!" I cracked up.

We kissed, and she said, "I don't know why, but I love hearing about your adventures. It makes me so turned on. Who got your cum?"

"If you must know," I said, "I made them get on their knees so they could both take it. And then had them share it."

"That's so dirty and sexy," she said. "I love cum so much. You should make me more of a cumslut."

"I will definitely keep that in mind," I said. "Your turn. You promised me your dirtiest Vegas story. You've heard all of mine. You're holding out on me!"

"So I've almost always been to Vegas with Kelly," she said, referring to her LA friend and TV mentor. "And usually it was just so easy to have fun. Blow and boys would just flow from our fingertips. But one spring trip we took, there just wasn't any attractive action."

I listened intently.

"I was pent up," she said. "And after a night and half a day with no prospects," she lowered her voice, "I put an ad on Craigslist."

"Wow," I said.

"I know, it sounds crazy!" she said. "But I got like two dozen responses in an hour. This was when Craigslist was at its peak. I got phone numbers from a couple guys after verifying their pictures, and picked one to meet up with. He was from San Diego, and I met him at the MGM for a drink."

"Where was Kelly?" I asked.

"Watching," she said. "Making sure I was safe. He was gorgeous. I mean, just such a pretty boy. I knew right there I was going to fuck him. I had two drinks, texted Kelly I was okay, and told him I wanted to fuck if he would like to join me."

I squirmed in my seat. This was an incredible turn on.

"So like an hour after meeting, I was bent over the desk in my room at the Bellagio with this gorgeous hunk with a perfect cock just railing me," she said. I could feel her hot breath on my cheek as she whispered the story. She was turned on recounting it. "He did whatever he wanted. He was such an arrogant prick, but so pretty, and his dick just stayed so nice and hard."

My mouth was dry. My pants strained.

Kat continued, "We went three rounds before he left, and it wasn't until after he did that I realized I never even thought about using a condom."

I groaned. "You are such a bad girl," I said, nearly panting. "You know how much I hate condoms."

She let her hand brush across my crotch. "I hate them, too," she said. "I haven't really told you how often I would just let guys fuck me raw. I would get so turned on, and if a guy was super hot? I just let him. Especially if I was high, which was a lot."

I pulled her close to me. I felt like I was going to explode. "Spoken like a true slut," I said. "I love it."

"I saw him again briefly the next day," she said, her lips glistening with saliva. "We bumped into each other at the pool, and I let him fuck me in a bathroom. He didn't even acknowledge me again at the pool. I felt like such a whore. Except I didn't even get paid."

I kissed her, my hungry tongue invading her mouth. I didn't care about the driver. Kat was the perfect slut. We had arrived at the airport, and I took a moment to get out of the Uber. I felt like the barest touch against my cock, even of my pants against it, would make me explode. I recovered enough to get our luggage inside, and off we went. The weekend had barely started, and it was off to an electric beginning.

* * *

The flight was uneventful. The flight attendants were attentive, which was annoying only because I had wanted to play with Kat's cum-filled pussy. We had to resort to dirty talk, which made the three hours go quickly.

When we arrived, a Wynn Resorts Rolls Royce waited for us outside baggage claim. The driver was familiar, and I tipped him up front. The Strip buzzed with neon and energy as we drove up the back route to the Wynn, its curved tower inviting and promising adventure. My host met us with our room keys. By 10 p.m., we were in our suite. By 10:05, Kat's tits were pressed against a floor-to-ceiling window overlooking the Strip. I awkwardly drove my cock inside her because of the odd standing-up position we had to use, but the glory of the view was too good not to be inside her while we enjoyed it. I pulled her head back by her hair, licked her ear, and said, "This is my favorite city, and it has never looked better."

She slipped out from under me and turned around, mashing her ass against the window this time. She kissed me and said, "I hope someone out there can see us."

My cock was achingly hard, and she grabbed it and guided it between her thighs. She moved it back and forth between her slippery pussy lips, teasing.

"You know," she said. "I hate to say it, but I'm a little tired."

I took the hint and decided to toy with her a bit. "Me, too," I said. "I actually was going to suggest that we go get something to eat and hit the tables. We can go to the coffee shop on the way." I also liked the idea of edging our desire a bit. Otherwise, we'd never leave the room all weekend.

Her eyebrows furrowed at me. "I'm not sure coffee is going to cut it. I've been up for 21 hours!"

"You'll see."

We dressed. I kept on a blazer. Kat wore a tight, short cocktail dress in green--the color she could never wear at work because of the green screen. I instructed her not to wear panties or a bra. She looked exquisite, her legs inviting with four-inch heels. We went down to the coffee shop, which was closed.

"Now what?" Kat said.

I put my arm around her back and patted her butt. "Give me a second," I said. "Wait here."

My connection was discreet. He waited in a corner, out of the bustle of passing casino-goers. The exchange wouldn't have been noticeable even if security walked by. Just two white guys dressed up for a night in the casino. We split in opposite directions, and I returned to Kat.

"I'm such an idiot," I said. "I forgot my wallet upstairs. Let's go get it really quick."

She clutched my arm and walked close to me toward the elevator. "You got some, didn't you?" she said excitedly.

I grinned. "I don't like to sleep when I'm in Vegas. And there's nothing wrong with being a little bit of a party girl, is there?"

In the room, I produced a swollen baggie of cocaine and handed it to Kat. "I'll let you do the honors," I said.

"Holy shit, babe," she said. "How much is this?"

"Um, it should be 10 grams," I said. "Two of us, 48 hours... figured that would be enough."

Kat already was crushing and chopping four generous lines. She took a tiny bit on her finger nail and took a test sniff. "Oh fuck," she said. "It's good." She offered me a nailful. I obliged. It was good quality.

"I've known this guy for several years," I said. "Discreet and high purity. Expensive, but that's what you've got to do in Vegas if you don't want baking soda."

"Do you have a bill, babe?" Kat asked. "I didn't bring my kit to the airport."

I smiled. "And now for the first of my weekend surprises for you, darling," I said.

I gave her a small box I had been holding. She unwrapped it. Inside were a snuff bullet, waterproof vial with a small spoon attached to the cap, and a glass straw.

"Your very own Vegas weekend coke kit," I said.

"You really are more than just an amazing dick," she teased me.

We took off the travel fatigue with two lines each, and Kat loaded up the vial and the bullet. She put the bullet in her purse and gave the vial to me.

"I think I'm tempted to say fuck dinner," she said, kissing me.

"I am, too," I said, "but if we don't eat something now, we are going to seriously regret it in the morning. I have a lot planned for us."

We stopped in at Sinatra, which was packed, but I knew the bartender and tipped him generously. We grabbed a couple drinks and appetizers, and I felt a great sense of contentment. It felt normal being with Kat. We wrapped up, and she excused herself to the restroom. I had another surprise for her next, bottle service at the XS nightclub. I knew she loved to dance. We could finally explore some of the things we loved. Together.

Kat put her arms around me from behind when she returned. "That bullet is perfect," she said in a low voice. "So perfect." The coked out look in her eyes was familiar to me now.

I smiled. "How many hits did you take?" I got up from the bar stool and left the bartender a $100 bill, made eye contact, and waved to him.

"Four," she said sheepishly. "I wasn't sure what you had planned for me next!"

I drank in Kat's beauty in the green dress that clung to every curve. What I had at first judged as a girl-next-door look had become, to me, the epitome of beauty. I saw the slightest poke of nipples. I loved the hint of hip bone pressing against the fabric.

"Let's hit a craps table," I said, "and I'll fill you in on the evening plan."

I cashed in $2,000 each for us at a craps table with a $100 minimum. Craps was my game. I appreciated the social aspect of it. The energy at a good table was incomparable in a casino. We sidled up to the crowded table, the other players generously making plenty of space for Kat and her second-skin dress.

"Do you know the rules?" I asked.

"I've played craps before," she smiled as she stacked her chips along the railing.

We stayed at the table for almost an hour. At first, the play was choppy, and I told her we had bottle service and a table at XS whenever we were ready to move on. When Kat got a chance with the dice, she had an impressive run. She hit four points, but she was making a long run on the numbers, especially 6 and 8, which were my favorite bets. With her short dress, she also made an exaggerated lean against the table as she rolled. The hem climbed tantalizingly close to revealing her naked, smooth cunt. I loved it. The other males at the table jockeyed for a chance to see behind her when she threw the dice. A couple women presumed she was a hooker. That turned me on.

We cashed out, up a combined $1,500. "I guess we can get some Champagne at XS," I said. "Restroom break?"

"You read my mind," she said.

The adrenaline rush of the craps table waned, so I hit a stall and took out the vial. A few bumps of coke, and I was ready to party. I met Kat outside, looking refreshed.

"That bullet is my new best friend," she laughed.

We skipped the line at XS, and a gorgeous host escorted us to an upper level cabana outside, where the Encore Beach Club occurred during the day before giving way to an all-night bacchanalia. The cabana would give us plenty of privacy when we wanted it. A bubbly, college-aged waitress came over a short time later, and I waved off the explanation of the bottle service requirements. I peeled off two crisp hundred-dollar bills and told her to bring bottles of Dom Perignon until we said to stop. The music thundered, and even this far from the DJ stage, you could feel the bass pulse in your chest.

We took a break on the cushioned banquette in the cabana and sloppily kissed. My hand made its way naturally up Kat's thigh, pushing the short dress higher. Maybe we should have finished our earlier fuck to dial back some of the tension we were now feeling. As my hand moved to her cheek, stroking it, our blonde bottle service girl returned with an exotic, tattooed brunette who was carrying an ice bucket sporting two bottles of Dom. The waitress put down two flutes, bending over with a gratuitous amount of cleavage directly in front of me, her thighs almost brushing Kat's face.

"Just the two of you?" she asked.

"For now," I said. "You might be surprised at the damage we do!"

Kat admired both girls. Her pupils were dilated. Then she noticed that her legs were spread a bit wide, and it was obvious she wasn't wearing panties. The brunette admired her back and said, "This seems like the cabana to be in tonight." Another round of $100 bills for each girl, and Kat and I returned to making out.

"This is the perfect start," Kat said, as we clinked glasses and enjoyed the refreshing cool of the Dom. "I am so happy I'm here. I'm so happy it's with you."

"I think we needed this," I said. "And, trust me, tonight is only the start."

"How do you think they feel about doing coke in the cabanas?" she said.

"With what our tab is going to be tonight? I don't think they're going to give a shit as long as we aren't idiots about it," I said.

We drained our glasses quickly between sips. The blonde girl reappeared to refill them, and I asked her name.

"Caitlyn," she said. "And that was Juliana helping me. We will take care of everything you need all night."

I smiled warmly. "I will definitely let you know," I said. "Can you still join us for shots? It's been a while since I've been to XS."

"If we're discreet about it," Caitlyn said, "we can have a little fun!" She bounced away to another table.

"What are you angling for, mister?" Kat said.

"She seems like a party girl," I said. "I know the type. I've encountered all their forms. Maybe she'll do a line off your tits later."

We laughed and went back to kissing between sips on a second glass of Dom. My hand worked its way between Kat's thighs, brushing her wet lips, then backed off. I reached inside my blazer's inner pocket and pulled out the vial. I held it close and scooped a little coke onto my finger, which was just lightly coated with Kat's juices. I moved the finger between her legs again and rubbed the cocaine into her soaking wet cunt.

"You're so naughty, John," Kat said. "You are going to make me want to ride you right here."

I was just putting the vial away when Juliana appeared, and I cursed myself for being too obvious and risky.

"This is the party cabana tonight," she said breezily. "I knew I liked you two." She refilled our glasses. "Do you want me to pop the second bottle?"

"Please," I said. "We're going to go dance for a little bit, but we'll be back for refills."

"Let me try the bullet," I said when Juliana disappeared, and I put two bumps in each nostril. This was very good coke. I felt slightly numb and extremely energetic as I took Kat's hand and led her into the heart of the club.

It was jam-packed and almost impossible to dance. Well, impossible unless you simply disregarded personal space. I spied a few attractive couples and forced our way toward them, where unintentional contact would be more to our liking. We danced. It was so close that it made it awkward. The music blared. Our movements didn't seem entirely our own, more like waves in an ocean of people, involuntarily swaying us one way or another. A tall, muscular guy next to us didn't hide his admiration or running hands from Kat. I admit, I treated his busty, bombshell girlfriend the same way. It was all good Vegas club fun.

Kat leaned in and screamed, "I can't see the guy behind me, but his cock is huge and keeps rubbing against me."

I looked behind her. It looked like a kid in his 20s. The easy, good looking surfer type who never has to try at anything.

"Where are you wanting all this to go tonight?" I yelled back.

"Let's go get a refill," Kat said loudly.

We extricated ourselves from the dance floor. When we returned to the cabana, a new bottle of Dom had joined our newly opened second. Fresh flutes sat on the table. Caitlyn, who must have spotted us walking back, was already pouring, her ass in her short dress obscenely in our faces.

Kat and I took stock. We were sweating. Kat's dress had risen so high it barely covered her crotch. The entire scene was dripping with sexual tension. I put my arms around Kat, as if I was going to help her smooth her dress down, but instead I crudely let a finger slip across her pussy lips to test her arousal. Caitlyn didn't even flinch.

"Caitlyn," I said, "would you like to have a bump with us?"

She smiled. "If we're quick and careful!"

Kat shared the bullet. Caitlyn took a quick sniff on each side of her nose. She moved her lips very close to Kat's as she returned it and said, "Oh, that's good. Thank you for being so generous."

We all laughed. Kat and I hit the Champagne again. When Caitlyn left, we chatted, breath returning to normal after the dance floor.

"I really don't want to share you tonight," I said, "but adding to the tension is making me really crazy."

"I need you so badly," Kat said. "I'll do anything you want."

I filed that knowledge away for later. But getting bottle service, tipping heavily, and taking home a couple club waitress sluts was something I'd done a dozen times on Vegas trips. This wasn't about that. Not this time, anyway. But it didn't mean we couldn't have some fun and ramp things up even further.

Juliana appeared and looked sheepish. I asked her if she wanted a bump, too. She grinned, and we obliged. She made the same near-contact with Kat's lip as she returned the bullet.

"Let's dance," Kat said. We fed each other bumps out of the spoon first and then returned to the same spot on the dance floor. The tall guy with the bombshell girlfriend was still there. Kat danced with him. I "danced" with the girlfriend, if grabbing two handfuls of ass while she gyrated counted as dancing.

I passed Kat the bullet, and she shared it with the tall guy's girlfriend. A couple club rat sluts saw them doing bumps and asked in on the action. Kat was generous. She suggested we all go to our cabana for drinks. I handed off the coke vial to her.

On the way, passing Caitlyn, I asked her to shift to magnums of Dom and had her bring out a round of Sex on the Beach shots, including two for her and Juliana. "We're going to close the curtains," I said, "but you two can just come on in."

When I reached the cabana, I closed the curtains behind me. Kat had wasted no time passing around the vial of coke, and everyone started doing bumps. The club rats, the term I gave to people who lurked around the club looking for free drinks and party favors, actually were pretty, sweet, and grateful for our generosity. They were UNLV students who said their major was hospitality, but it looked to me like cocaine was their real area of expertise.

--------------------------------------------
The couple were Jason and Laurie, in Vegas from LA celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary. They were lively but chill. We polished off the two open bottles of Dom, when Caitlyn and Juliana arrived with two magnums and the round of shots. The vial and bullet were just sitting in the middle of the table. They opened the bubbles and passed out the shots. We all clinked glasses and pounded them back.

Caitlyn nibbled my ear and asked for some coke. I told her and Juliana they were welcome to the goodies. They indulged and disappeared. My head was swimming a bit, and Kat and I shared hits from the bullet. This was the Vegas I loved. Total debauchery, ramping up from every direction. I ignored our guests and took Kat back to the dance floor.

When we returned, Jason was making out with one of the coeds, while Laurie made out with the other. Caitlyn and Juliana hit the coke bullet, which we had left behind. Kat and I laughed. "Look at the monster we've created!" she exclaimed.

Kat and I greedily fed each other bumps. I had Caitlyn refresh my Champagne, and when I turned around again, Kat was kissing Juliana.

"I hope you're not the jealous type," Caitlyn said quietly.

I laughed. "Vegas doesn't suit jealous types," I said.

She put her lips close to mine, her tongue pushing out behind them just a bit. "It's almost last call," she said. "Is there anything you want to order?" She licked her lips.

"You've been a doll," I said. "One more magnum." I went with the moment and kissed her. Her mouth had the slight taste of cocaine bitterness. She broke the kiss and strode out of the cabana to fetch the Champagne.

Kat and Juliana did more coke, then Juliana excused herself. Kat and I drank in our new friends, now more or less a single mass of flesh, kissing each other when they weren't drinking Dom.

"I am so ready to fuck you," I growled to Kat.

"Just me?" she asked and batted her eyelashes. Her eyes were wired. "I saw you and Caitlyn. I think you like her."

I smiled. "She's no Kitty Kat," I said. "This is all fun, but I think tonight needs to be us." She kissed me deeply, urgently... gratefully.

The coke was running low. I asked Caitlyn to close out our tab, leaving the rest of the final magnum behind for our guests. I passed each of the servers $500 in cash on top of the $2,000 tip I had added to the check. Caitlyn asked if we needed anything else. I shook my head. She bent down close to me one last time to pick up the signed bill and said, "I'm a three hole girl."

Kat heard it and smiled at her. "So am I," she said, not out of jealousy but with pride.

I took Caitlyn's phone number and asked her to text me with Juliana's, as well. I sent her a thank-you message and told her we would certainly see each other again.

"You can never have too many Vegas friends," I told Kat as we walked out of the club. It was nearing 4 a.m. The time had gone by in a flash. We walked quickly, the time at the club serving as a midpoint, rather than a culmination, of our night. Essentially we had spent four hours perpetually edging each other's orgasms. It was time to let all that energy out.

* * *

We made out like teenagers and pawed at each other like animals in the elevator going back up to our suite. As soon as we got inside, Kat took the coke vial from me, dumped the rest of it on the marble-topped coffee table and bent over to chop up lines with the remnants. Her hair was tousled, and the dress rode up high enough for me to see the glistening between her thighs.

I stripped down and reopened the floor-to-ceiling windows that housekeeping had closed during the nightly turndown service. Kat and I hit two thick lines each, then she climbed on top of me as I sat on the sofa. She teased the tip of my cock with her wet cunt. I kissed her neck, loving the salty, sweaty musk she had worked up over the night. I roughly cupped her tits and bit at her nipples as she ground her crotch into mine, never letting me penetrate her beyond the tip of my cock.

"This was the best fucking night," Kat panted. "I just need one more thing."

"Stop teasing me, you fucking slut," I said. I grabbed her hips firmly, kissed her, and forced her pussy down onto the length of my cock. Luckily, her hole had been lined up perfectly with me, and I bottomed out in one smooth movement. We groaned in unison.

"I needed this," I said urgently. "I need you. You are the hottest fuck I've ever had."

I was bucking my hips against hers, but I wanted more control. I picked her up and threw her off me, pushing her over the back of the sofa and lining my cock up behind her. She faced the open windows overlooking the Strip. I plunged in and began to spank her in rhythm to my strokes.

She gave guttural moans, unable to speak coherently. I slammed in and out of her like a piston, relentlessly and roughly. The flashing lights of the Strip were hypnotic, urging us on. I wondered if I had ever experienced greater pleasure than this moment.

Kat broke into orgasm. The coke had given us incredible stamina, and the buildup created an intensity neither of us had ever felt together. Her climax was prolonged, an opera of moans and screams of pleasure. When she finally calmed down, her tense body relaxing, she looked back to me and said, "I want your cum all over me."

She moved off the sofa and took my dick in her mouth, sucking eagerly. She kept pulling off, begging me to cum for her. Telling me she needed to be covered in sperm. Commanding me to paint her with spunk. Her dirty talk, deepthroating, and manipulation of my balls with her fingers broke through any resistance the coke may have put up.

My thighs tensed, and my abdomen clenched. As I erupted, Kat pulled her mouth off me, jerking my cock and squeezing my balls. She aimed straight at her face, but my cum flew everywhere. It covered her tits, neck, face, and hair. It shot onto the sofa. She was a glazed mess by the time I came to a panting finish.

She smiled at me, "I need to go look in the mirror at this!"

She was a masterpiece of a cum slut. She started running a finger over her face and licking the cum off it. "You taste so good, daddy," she said. "That was so fucking hot. I could see it shooting out like ropes."

I was spent. It was nearly 5:30 a.m. We contemplated doing a couple lines and going another round but thought the better of it. As we climbed into bed, the faintest hints of sunrise peaked out from behind the mountains. We needed to get a couple hours of sleep, at least. I had a lot planned for us on that Friday.
